<br/><br/>Commuting to school is hellish.<br/><br/>Sungwoo Yu was often exhausted when he finally arrived at campus after transferring three times, which took him two hours each way.<br/><br/>So, he tried his best to avoid his 9:30AM class as much as possible, but it didn’t work out as he wished because it was one of the required courses for his major.<br/><br/>“Urgh! Oh no! How did I manage to attend school in my freshman year? I think I have to make a choice between living near school and dropping out of college,” he grumbled, getting off the shuttle bus. He felt his whole body aching after the long commute.<br/><br/>Hanho Lee, who was a year younger, teased while following him, “Hey, why are you so weak-minded as a retired squad commander of the army special forces?”<br/><br/>The other day when he drank with Hanho, Sungwoo bragged about his heroic exploits when he was in the army. After that, Hanho made fun of him whenever he had a chance.<br/><br/>“Are you sure you were really an army special forces member? Aren’t you lying to me? You said you were done marching 10 kilometers quickly in full gear, right? Then why can’t you stand sitting on the bus or subway for two hours while commuting here?”<br/><br/>As if he felt what Hanho said was ridiculous, Sungwoo tapped him on the shoulder and said, “Hanho, can’t you stop preaching me until after you join the army? How long are you going to delay going to the army?”<br/><br/>“Well, let me tell you one thing, Sungwoo. The unification coin will prevail.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo clicked his tongue at his strong ambitions.<br/><br/>“Damn it! What the heck are you talking about when you don’t pay any attention to the news at all? You don’t deserve to mention national unification! Don’t you know you are in a limbo because you kept delaying joining the army because of Miyoung? I doubt unification will ever come true when you have already broken up with her.”<br/><br/>Hanho’s face hardened at his sarcastic reply.<br/><br/>“Well, would you please not mention her?”<br/><br/>“Hanho, I clearly told you at the welcoming ceremony for freshmen three years ago that there should not be any campus couples, right?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Obviously it was impossible for a man like Hanho, who was part of a campus couple but had no military experience, to win the argument with anybody.<br/><br/>Despite Hanho’s silence, Sungwoo kept mentioning her name while heading for the campus building for his first class. Hanho suddenly began to look in the sky blankly.<br/><br/>“What the heck! Are you crying now?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/>“No, I’m just looking at the sky…”<br/><br/>“Sky? I wonder if you’re conjuring up her face there…”<br/><br/>“Didn’t you see those letters in the sky a moment ago?”<br/><br/>When he said that, Sungwoo raised his head, but he saw only the cloudless blue sky.<br/><br/>“You miss her very much, right?”<br/><br/>“Oh, no! I clearly saw the letters only a moment ago! It said something like monster downloading. It said 99% downloading, then suddenly disappeared when it was 100%. I mean it was over there on the top of the library building!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked up at the sky again, but he saw only a few birds fluttering away into the sky.<br/><br/>“…Monster? Hey, dude, what kind of game did you play last night? Can’t you tell reality from a dream?”<br/><br/>“Oh, I’m serious…”<br/><br/>“I think you saw an illusion because you have been drinking too much these days.”<br/><br/>“…Ah, you think so?”<br/><br/>Hanho easily agreed. It was true that these days he was unstable and nervous. Nonetheless, he looked at the sky several times as if he felt uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Clicking his tongue, Sunwoo kept walking while Hanho slapped his face a couple of times and caught up with him quickly.<br/><br/>“Hey, Sungwoo, can you get me a cup of coffee from a vending machine? I seriously need some caffeine because I feel like I’m losing my mind at the moment.”<br/><br/>“I don’t have time. Prof. Hwang will come in at any moment. Just look at the long line before the vending machine. Are you going to swap your grade for a cup of coffee?”<br/><br/>Even before the first class began, there was a long line before the vending machine on the first floor of the building.<br/><br/>“Well, are you going to doze off again? Your strong mentality as a former special forces member will be tested again…”<br/><br/>At that moment, Hanho stopped because he knew he would be in big trouble if his tongue slipped any further.<br/><br/>“See you at lunch then. I could end early today. By the way, I really saw the letters,” Hanho said.<br/><br/>“Stop the nonsense! Let me head out first. Talk to you later.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo took the elevator to the fourth floor and arrived at the lecture hall. When he came in, the professor also arrived right on time.<br/><br/>“…Oops, I feel sleepy.”<br/><br/>Was it because he didn’t have coffee or was he so rusty after being discharged from the army and coming back to school only recently? In no time he felt sleepy as he could not concentrate on the lecture.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>He heard the professor’s voice vaguely, and his eyelids were heavy. His shoulders felt stiff, but he blamed it for his hellish commute to school.<br/><br/>Right at that moment, he saw some strange letters floating in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh? What the heck?”<br/><br/>He felt he was hallucinating while dozing off. He blinked his eyes, then roughly rubbed them. But the hologram message before his eyes didn’t disappear.<br/><br/>Tik, tik, tik.<br/><br/>At that moment, the monitor that was printing out the class material flickered, then all the fluorescent lights went out.<br/><br/>Woowoong~<br/><br/>“Ugh? What the heck is this? Is it a blackout?”<br/><br/>“What? I don’t see anything!”<br/><br/>It was not a simple blackout. As if the sun had gone out or one was thrown into the cosmos, the whole world plunged into darkness.<br/><br/>Sungwoo curled up in an attempt to defend himself against the contingencies.<br/><br/>“Even my mobile phone is off. What the heck is going on?”<br/><br/>“By the way, what the heck is this? I can see myself only here!”<br/><br/>“Me too…”<br/><br/>One thing was clearly visible. It was the holographic message that Sungwoo mistakenly regarded as a hallucination. It seemed that all the students in the hall saw the same thing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my…what is this?”<br/><br/>“15 seconds of what?”<br/><br/>Bright light shined before their eyes, and then the ten cards began to spin.<br/><br/>Just like a spinning wheel or conveyor-belt sushi, the cards came so close as if they could touch them, then quickly moved away clockwise. The cards had all sorts of pictures with various colored backgrounds.<br/><br/>“You guys see these cards too?”<br/><br/>“Hey, guys, don’t touch them recklessly!”<br/><br/>“He is right! Don’t touch them! They’re dangerous!”<br/><br/>Nobody knew why it was dangerous to touch them. They just avoided the cards instinctively. But Sungwoo harbored another doubt.<br/><br/>‘Isn’t it more dangerous to not do anything now? Who knows what’ll happen after 15 seconds?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Does it mean we have to choose a card?’<br/><br/>One card had the drawing of a fighter with a sword and a shield, another one with a wizard holding a cane, and another one with an archer holding an arrow. These three cards each had a star on the white background.<br/><br/>Another one had two stars on a green background, which looked like a priest in Sungwoo’s eyes. Was he a castle knight drawn on the card with three stars on the pink background?<br/><br/>Sungwoo tried his best to understand this ridiculous situation. Only seven seconds were left. What was this countdown forcing him to do?<br/><br/>‘What the heck is this? Is it similar to poker? What am I supposed to decide within this timeframe?’<br/><br/>At that moment, one card with the drawing of a fighter, which was off in the distance, disappeared with a ‘Poof!’ And then…<br/><br/>Bump!<br/><br/>“Ugh? What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>A sword suddenly dropped onto Sungwoo’s friend’s desk, who was sitting in front of him.<br/><br/>‘I wonder if it was dropped by the fighter on the card…’ </div><h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/>Although Sungwoo could not understand what was going on, he had only five seconds left.<br/><br/>‘Wait a minute! Wasn’t there a reminder that I should choose a good card in order to survive in the ruined world?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo reached out for a card unconsciously. He picked up the one with the most stars. Although he had no rational ground for choosing that one, he felt like he wanted to choose it if he had to anyway.<br/><br/>The card he picked up seemed unusual at first glance. With the black background, it had the drawing of a man in a white robe holding a long sickle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Necromancer?”<br/><br/>Isn’t Necromancer a wizard who controls skeletons or corpses in the fantasy world?<br/><br/><br/><br/>The card selection ended with that message, and all the messages disappeared.<br/><br/>Then the lecture hall became bright again, and the electricity came back.<br/><br/>Crackle…<br/><br/>At that moment, the guy in front of Sungwoo began to gently raise the sword off the desk. The sharp blade flashed under the fluorescent lights.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>The lecture hall was quiet. Everybody fixed their eyes on the sword with embarrassed looks. Where did it fall from?<br/><br/>“What happened a moment ago?”<br/><br/>“I feel like I was possessed by something. And…what the heck is that sword?”<br/><br/>“Is it a real sword? Oh my god! I’m scared…”<br/><br/>The lecture hall suddenly became noisy after a lapse of silence. Even the professor was looking out the window as if he was completely distracted by this mysterious phenomenon.<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not grasp the situation, but he was still bothered by the holographic message that said, ‘Fit to survive in the ruined world.’ The whole text containing the message felt ominous to him.<br/><br/>“This dropped when I chose the card with the drawing of the fighter…” said the guy in front of Sungwoo, raising the sword. Hearing that, Sungwoo looked up at the ceiling.<br/><br/>‘Dang it! Am I really a Necromancer? Why’s nothing appearing before me?’<br/><br/>Right at that moment, the back door of the lecture hall flung open suddenly, and something came in with a bang.<br/><br/>It was a man covered with blood.<br/><br/>“Argh! Ahhhhh! Get this out of me!”<br/><br/>Blood gushed out of his neck and sprayed over his shirt. And there was something stuck on his back…<br/><br/>A small green-skinned animal recklessly brandished a deadly weapon with its right hand, grabbing his hair with its left hand.<br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/>The little knife was stabbed in the man’s back and neck indiscriminately. He tried to resist the attack by all means, but he staggered dangerously as if he had bled too much.<br/><br/>“Oh my God!”<br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>The lecture hall turned into a mess all of a sudden. Terrified by the scene, all the students began fleeing the front of the hall, pushing and shoving the desks which screeched all over the place.<br/><br/>It was the crucible of chaos itself.<br/><br/>“Yuch…” The bloody man finally collapsed.<br/><br/>Watching with his dilated pupils, Sungwoo held his breath and took his butt off the chair slowly.<br/><br/>“Dang it…”<br/><br/>As he was sitting in the seat right in front of the back door, he could hardly move because he felt like it could draw the monster’s attention.<br/><br/>The green monster roared over the man’s body. Then it turned its head quickly, rolling its yellow eyes. It was obviously looking for its next prey.<br/><br/>“Ahhh! Sword! Hey, Minsu! Use the sword!”<br/><br/>“Minsu, do something about it! Please!”<br/><br/>Amid the chaotic situation, they began to look for Minsu, the only man holding the sword. And all of them hid behind his back. Sungwoo also cautiously stood up and looked at him anxiously. Sungwoo was now the closest person to the green monster.<br/><br/>“How can I…”<br/><br/>“You have the sword!”<br/><br/>But it seemed that Minsu had no intention of challenging the monster at all. He was holding the sword with both hands, but he was trembling hard.<br/><br/>“Hey, Minsu, you remember me, right?”<br/><br/>Standing in place, Sungwoo called his name in a calm tone. Though both of them were not close friends, they knew each other.<br/><br/>“God damn it! What do you want me to do?”<br/><br/>“Ah…”<br/><br/>As he reacted violently, Sungwoo immediately felt that it was impossible to persuade him.<br/><br/>After all, the monster turned to Sungwoo, who was close by, and ran into him.<br/><br/>Sungwoo wished he had escaped quickly, but it was too late. The green monster turned up its mouth slightly, then charged toward him.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo screamed sharply, but he decided to challenge the monster rather than flee because he recalled the bloody man who was stabbed by the monster on its back.<br/><br/>‘I’m done for if I show my back to the monster!’<br/><br/>And his choice of action was efficient.<br/><br/>Bam!<br/><br/>The little monster which weighed about 15kg was knocked out by his front kick.<br/><br/>The monster hysterically stood up with its hands on the floor. But Sungwoo took the next action.<br/><br/>“Get the fuck out of here, son of a bitch!”<br/><br/>He was about to lift his chair while shouting like that, but he got in trouble.<br/><br/>“Ugh?”<br/><br/>As it turned out, the chair was part of the so-called all-in-one desk, cited as the college students’ public enemy No. 1 as well as the worst invention. Besides, it was much heavier than he thought.<br/><br/>Sungwoo, who was holding onto the back of the chair, failed to lift it on the first try.<br/><br/>“Ah?”<br/><br/>The monster didn’t lose the chance to attack him this time. It lowered its position, then stuck out its hand that was holding a knife. Obviously it was determined not to suffer another kick.<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>Fuming, he grabbed the lower part of the desk and lifted it effortlessly like a weightlifter. Normally he could have never done it, but he showed superhuman power faced with the possibility of imminent death.<br/><br/>Then he struck its head with the desk chair rather than throwing it.<br/><br/>The monster came close right up to his nose, stretching the knife, but it could not do anything when struck against the heavy desk chair.<br/><br/>Struck hard, it stuck out its tongue with its broken head. At first glance, it was killed on the spot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haah…”<br/><br/>Breathing out roughly, Sungwoo stepped back. Looking back, the scared students were watching him.<br/><br/>“Goblin? Ten gold? No way!”<br/><br/>The little green monster was like the low-level ‘goblins’ that often appeared in fantasy. Gold? Although he could not figure out what it was, it was clear that the world around him began to spin like a fantasy game.<br/><br/>Another message appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>List of subordinates (⅓)<br/><br/>Goblin Skeleton (LV.1)<br/><br/>*Weapon: dagger<br/><br/>*Species: goblin<br/><br/>*Characteristics: undead<br/><br/>“…Ugh? Subordinates?”<br/><br/>What the heck was this? But the faces of the students packed in front of the hall began to contort with fear.<br/><br/>“Ahhh! Oh no!”<br/><br/>“Ugh? Look back!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head like them.<br/><br/>Rattle~<br/><br/>A goblin was standing up after pushing the desk chair. Precisely speaking, it was a skeleton with its skin and intestines smashed to ashes.<br/><br/>Then it slowly walked toward Sungwoo and knelt before him.<br/><br/>“Ah?”<br/><br/>It was a difficult situation for him. While watching it bitterly, he recalled the occupation he chose.<br/><br/>‘Necromancer…’<br/><br/>Necromancers controlled the undead. And the subordinates he resurrected obeyed him absolutely. It was a concept commonly found in the fantasy genre.<br/><br/>‘No way!’<br/><br/>Squeak! At that moment, two more goblins appeared through the back door.<br/><br/>“Another appeared again!”<br/><br/>“This time there are two goblins!”<br/><br/>While the lecture hall was chaotic with the stunned students screaming, Sungwoo looked at the skeleton and the two goblins alternately. Then a new message appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was thinking of ordering them to ‘Fight!’ But even before he opened his mouth, the skeleton raised its body and began to walk toward the goblins stoutly.<br/><br/>The goblins were hesitating before the skeleton as if they found a kindred spirit in it…<br/><br/>But the skeleton stabbed the sword into their heads. </div><h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/>The skeleton moved according to Sungwoo’s intuition. In other words, it did what he wanted by checking his preferences in advance even when he didn’t want to control it consciously. It was fighting a deadly fight with the two goblins on his behalf now.<br/><br/>Woof!<br/><br/>The skeleton pulled a dagger out of the goblins. It seemed that the attack was not fatal as if the dagger had missed the mark a bit.<br/><br/>Then the two goblins indiscriminately began to wield the swords at the skeleton that had been resurrected like them.<br/><br/>But their swords, originally designed to cut apart human flesh, didn’t seem to deal any damage to the skeleton.<br/><br/>It seemed that the skeleton’s durability was not that strong. Its right elbow was smashed by the goblins’ clumsy attack. Now with its left hand as the only weapon, the skeleton was on the defensive. Sungwoo began to feel nervous while watching the fight.<br/><br/>‘If I don’t go to its rescue, I have to face them again.’<br/><br/>When he confronted the goblin, he felt that it was not a formidable rival. Besides, the goblin’s build was as small as a child. But it would be tough for him to fight several goblins this time. So, he thought he had to preclude such possibilities.<br/><br/>‘I wish I had a good weapon…’<br/><br/>Turning his head, Sungwoo looked at Minsu. He was standing there awkwardly, gripping the sword with both hands. Sungwoo could not find any righteous spirit in him.<br/><br/>“Hey, give me the sword quickly! Right now!”<br/><br/>Minsu opened his eyes wide at his yelling. Then he hugged the sword he had stuck out.<br/><br/>“What? Why do you need it?” Minsu asked.<br/><br/>“Give it to me quickly! Let me kill them with it!”<br/><br/>But Minsu shook his head and said, “Nope, this is mine! I got this by selecting the card!”<br/><br/>What the heck? Sungwoo was dumbfounded to hear that. He was aware that Minsu was not sociable, but how could he claim such ridiculous ownership of the sword in this situation?<br/><br/>“Then, you go out and kill them yourself!”<br/><br/>“…Ugh?”<br/><br/>When he said that, Minsu’s face turned white.<br/><br/>‘You don’t want to, dickhead!’<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t force him to hand it over. He knew he would be in bigger trouble than now if he touched such a timid guy. Based on his experience as a retired sergeant, it was best to not touch someone acting like an advisor.<br/><br/>“That’s fine. Go and peel potatoes with that.”<br/><br/>“…What did you say?”<br/><br/>This time, Sungwoo also lifted the desk with a chair. At that moment, the skeleton, with its only functional left hand, stepped aside as if it had been waiting for his move.<br/><br/>‘Oh, you already know what I’m going to do?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo then threw the desk toward the goblins. They fell to the floor, struck by the heavy desk.<br/><br/>Seizing the chance, the skeleton sprang out at them and skillfully stabbed the sword in their necks and bellies.<br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>While a total of two messages came out, the skeleton killed the two goblins at the same time and the lecture hall turned into a sea of blood. When the fight was over, the one-armed skeleton waddled toward Sungwoo and looked up at him blankly just like a puppy thirsty for praise.<br/><br/>“…Well, I’m sorry, but I feel bad. Can you look somewhere else?”<br/><br/>Even though it was his ally, Sungwoo felt unpleasant when the skeleton poked its skull at him.<br/><br/>It bowed its head at his request.<br/><br/>‘I wonder if the skeleton was disappointed in me.’<br/><br/>As he could not read any feelings in its hollow eyes, Sungwoo checked its face, fearing that it could change its mind.<br/><br/>‘Ah, since it has no eyes, I can’t check its feelings anyway.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>A list of your subordinates (3/3)<br/><br/>Goblin skeleton (LV.1)<br/><br/>Goblin skeleton (LV.1)<br/><br/>Goblin skeleton (LV.1)<br/><br/>*Tap for further information about the attribute of each member.<br/><br/>*You have reached the maximum number of subordinates.<br/><br/>The two goblins were resurrected as skeletons in no time. Then they gathered around Sungwoo, making a clattering noise. Now a total of three skeletons followed him.<br/><br/>“Hey, Sungwoo, what happened?” the middle-aged professor asked. Although he was shocked by the absurd situation like everybody else, the professor felt Sungwoo seemed sober.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the professor was full of doubt, which was understandable, given that Sungwoo was now controlling the monsters that popped up suddenly. But like everybody else there, Sungwoo could not understand the absurd situation either.<br/><br/>“I have no idea, but…” his words drifted while he was concentrating on the noise around him. Then he turned his head outside the window.<br/><br/>While silence reigned the lecture hall, he could feel that the whole campus was full of screams. He could hear horrible shrieks and screams outside the window, in the hallway and upstairs.<br/><br/>“It seems that the same thing is happening throughout the whole campus. Or maybe it…”<br/><br/>“Professor! I can’t get through to the police station with my mobile phone!” shouted a female student whom Sungwoo didn’t know.<br/><br/>Like she said, this kind of situation was common in horror films. In other words, all the lines to the police stations were busy at the moment.<br/><br/>‘Was it happening across the country or the whole world?’<br/><br/>While Sungwoo thought about that possibility, some of the students stricken with fear began to open the front door and ran out.<br/><br/>“We should not stay here. Let’s get out of campus!”<br/><br/>“Right. Where is my car? Oh, let’s go to the parking lot!”<br/><br/>In Sungwoo’s judgment, they were too hasty.<br/><br/>As expected, they began to shout, “Ugh? Ahhh! Let’s get out of here!”<br/><br/>They were watching something at the end of the hallway where the little monsters screamed and wailed.<br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/>The skeletons now began to run toward the back door. Although Sungwoo didn’t issue any orders, they acted as if to reflect his subconsciousness.<br/><br/>The three skeletons kicked the two goblins on the side when they were charging at the students.<br/><br/>Tangled up together in the hallway, they began to fight fiercely amongst themselves. While they were pushing and shoving, the skeletons began to suffer some cracks in their bones.<br/><br/>Crunch!<br/><br/>Obviously, the skeletons were on the defensive when it came to the gripping fight. They had no muscles to show their strength and they weighed less than the goblins.<br/><br/>“Everybody, get out of here! Let me stop them here! I mean those guys!”<br/><br/>Running around in confusion, the students began to disperse and head for the hallway on the opposite side. In a situation like this, scattering was not always a good option, but it was not good for them to gather in one place either.<br/><br/>Besides, it was impossible to confine those stricken with fear to any specific place. Sungwoo had no obligation to protect them anyway.<br/><br/>‘Yeah, they have the right to make their own choice.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo also agonized over what kind of option he would choose.<br/><br/>‘Right now everything is unclear, but there is a rule in this game. I should follow it.’<br/><br/>He was given an occupation, while his abilities and the appearance of the monsters could be called his game…<br/><br/>‘This might be a very stupid idea, but perhaps the more I fight against them, the higher the chances of my survival will be.’<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo made the choice to fight instead of fleeing. He could make the bold decision because he had subordinates to fight on his behalf. If he had received a sword by choosing the fighter card, he would certainly have not made this decision.<br/><br/>Puk! Puk!<br/><br/>Sungwoo watched the bloody fighting between the skeletons and goblins before his eyes. Tangled up together, all they did in the fight was grab and stab each other, but as they had no particular fighting skills, their battle was more intense.<br/><br/>Bam!<br/><br/>Right at that moment, one of the skeleton’s necks was smashed, and its skull rolled down to its feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please, please defeat them…”<br/><br/>Gulping, Sungwoo watched the dogfight anxiously. It seemed like there was little difference in the performance between the goblin skeleton and that of the living goblin. </div><h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/>Numerically speaking, the skeletons were superior to them. Although one of the skeletons fell, the two goblins were already broken into pieces.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whew! Good job…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo shouted hooray in spite of himself. Then there was a message that possibly signaled the start of a real game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Level?”<br/><br/>When the word ‘level’ was mentioned, it meant that he should now be ready for the real game.<br/><br/>It was the moment Sungwoo confirmed the validity of his prediction that the more he fought, the stronger he would become. He recited it to himself quietly as if he could not believe it.<br/><br/>“… Status bar?”<br/><br/>When he said that, a holographic window appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Name: Sungwoo Yu<br/><br/>Level: 2<br/><br/>Occupation: Necromancer<br/><br/>Capability: Muscle power (5), Agility (5), Physical strength (5)<br/><br/>Earned Gold: 50<br/><br/>But there was nothing like stats in the game. Didn’t players receive stats when their level went up? But his question was answered when a system window popped up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Stats (random)<br/><br/>Skill (random)<br/><br/>Item (random)<br/><br/>Other (random)<br/><br/>Muscle power increase (confirmed)<br/><br/>A total of five cards appeared before my eyes. Except for 5), they were all on the backside, so he found out that by using this, he could reinforce my stats, learn skills, or obtain items.<br/><br/>“Ah, random…”<br/><br/>But most of them were random. The last one, namely number 5, was the confirmed stats, but it suggested that luck played a big role from the start.<br/><br/>After agonizing for some time, Sungwoo chose ‘skills,’ the No. 2 item. Skill was one of the most important elements in most games, so he chose it because he was not sure what would come out of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then the skeletons began to rise from a heap of bodies. This time there was a total of five with the addition of one more.<br/><br/>Rattle—<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Mana?”<br/><br/>It seemed that he needed mana when he had to use skills to summon skeletons. So, when Sungwoo recalled mana, he saw a certain gauge before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The mana then increased to 4. It seemed like he didn’t need a lot of mana to summon just one skeleton.<br/><br/>“Hey, you guys are not playing hard to get, are you?”<br/><br/>When he said that, four goblins looked up at him all at once.<br/><br/>“Dang it, you really suck! I’m sorry to say this, but can you all just look down instead?”<br/><br/>They again looked down at his request.<br/><br/>“Good job.”<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>After a tough battle with the goblins, Sungwoo was left alone. Precisely speaking, he was left with four skeletons.<br/><br/>He put his head against the cold iron gate, then took it off. He did it to cool down his head, but it didn’t help. As he had been staying alert, he felt heartburn as if acid from his stomach was forced up the gullet.<br/><br/>“Okay, I should stay alert to survive. If I’m clumsy here, I can make a mistake. I don’t know what’s going on, but so far, so good, right?” Sungwoo reassured himself like that.<br/><br/>As someone who was discharged from the army recently, he was well aware that those who adapted themselves quickly to a strange environment could survive better than those who didn’t.<br/><br/>When he was in the army, there were two groups of recruits thrown into a strange environment, namely those who could easily adapt and earn their commanders’ trust, and those who ended up as outcasts by failing to adapt.<br/><br/>“…Above all, let me survive. I have to think of that only.”<br/><br/>Hearing the strange screaming echoing down the hallway, he patted his cheeks lightly, then took three deep breaths.<br/><br/>“Phew! Let me buck up and get out of here.”<br/><br/>The lecture hall was located on the fourth floor of the Humanity and Social Sciences building. Sungwoo checked the situation outside the window.<br/><br/>The cafe streets below the building were lined with bodies, and dozens of goblins were running around, screeching.<br/><br/>“Damn it. I feel safer here. I don’t think I should go down there…”<br/><br/>But he could not stay here forever. With the skeletons walking ahead of him, he cautiously headed one floor down.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>Right at that moment, somebody wielding a dagger walked out of the 3rd floor, stunned. That dagger cut through the skull bones of one skeleton, but that was it.<br/><br/>“…Ugh? Sungwoo!”<br/><br/>“Ah, Hanho!”<br/><br/>It was none other than Hanho who was holding the dagger. Sungwoo felt relieved when he met the familiar face. But Hanho was still full of alertness.<br/><br/>“What the heck are these?” asked Hanho.<br/><br/>“Oh, don’t worry. How can I describe them? My bodyguard?”<br/><br/>“…Are you sure?”<br/><br/>After agonizing over how to explain, he opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“Hanho, did you choose an occupation card too?”<br/><br/>“Ah, card? Oh, you’re right…well, I chose one with the drawing of a thief.”<br/><br/>“Why did you choose such a damn thing? How many stars were on the card?”<br/><br/>While trembling hard, Hanho agonized over his question seriously.<br/><br/>“Stars? Oh, I got only one star. One star is a brigadier general, right? It’s good, right?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo let out a sigh. He knew Hanhoo was an innocent junior, though he was a bit dumb. And Sungwoo could guess his personality in this difficult situation.<br/><br/>“Well…just think that way. Let’s go down to a safe place. We will be safe with these guys walking ahead of us.”<br/><br/>Then the skeletons began to step down, rattling as they went. Sungwoo and Hanho followed them. When they arrived on the second floor, there was a one-line message before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Synergy list<br/><br/>Dagger thief group (1st stage)<br/><br/>Class: weapon synergy<br/><br/>Condition: 5 daggers loaded<br/><br/>Effect: probability of fatality (+10%), gold accumulation (+10%)<br/><br/>“Ugh? Do you also see this?”<br/><br/>“Yep. Synergy?”<br/><br/>The meaning was clear. It seemed that they received buffs with the gathering of similar patterns. In other words, the more teamwork they had, the more benefits they would get.<br/><br/>“But the thing is whether we can get this with these skeletons, which are not humans.”<br/><br/>Four of the daggers that created the synergy of  were held by the skeletons.<br/><br/>‘I am not sure yet, but they are quite useful. Even if I move alone, I can create the effect of several people moving, right? I think I chose the good one.’<br/><br/>Now the situation was clear where the increase in stats was given randomly. The most important factor in survival was ‘luck.’ Sungwoo thought he was very lucky from the beginning, but at that moment he ran into a group of goblins coming up from the 1st-floor stairs. There were as many as seven.<br/><br/>Squeak!<br/><br/>The one far behind them was twice as big as the other goblins, carrying a string of Buddhist prayer beads around its neck. Besides, it was holding a long spear in its hand.<br/><br/>“Hey, that bastard seems like their chief, doesn’t it?”<br/><br/>Having said that, Hanho stepped back. Sungwoo was ready to flee if things went wrong. No matter how hard he thought, he could not beat the gang of seven goblins.<br/><br/>But wasn’t survival decided by sheer luck?<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the gang of goblins was hesitant, then they began to move back. The anger disappeared from their faces. Instead, they were full of fear.<br/><br/>“Hmmm…aren’t we lucky?”<br/><br/>Then the four skeletons began to walk down the stairs with their loud rattling.<br/><br/>The moment the goblins fell under the curse and Sungwoo became strongly determined, the skeletons began to charge towards the goblins.<br/><br/>Rattle, rattle.<br/><br/>They raced down the stairs without any hesitation and stormed the goblins.<br/><br/>Squeak! Squeak!<br/><br/>The goblins that caught ‘The Smell of Death’ were very slow to respond as if their bodies were frozen. The skeletons caught up and stabbed the daggers into them. One of them rolled off the stairs and was pushed out when stabbed.<br/><br/>“Wow! Good job!” </div><h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/>Hanho, who was about to run away at any time, admired the spectacular fight scene.<br/><br/>In fact, he was only thinking of running away from the monsters after this happened. He had no other choice to survive because he never thought of confronting them like this. Never did he think he could fight by using the enemy’s bodies…<br/><br/>At that moment, the bulky goblin lifted its left hand right away.<br/><br/>Squeak!<br/><br/>As soon as it did so, the bracelet on its forearm began to shine. It was an ominous sign at first glance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, the scared goblins’ eyes began to emit red light.<br/><br/>Squeak!<br/><br/>As if the curse spell of ‘The Smell of Death’ was broken, the goblins’ actions were now more flexible, and they began to push the skeletons up the stairs.<br/><br/>Hanho, feeling nervous, murmured, “Ah? Sungwoo, shall we run away now?”<br/><br/>“…Wait a minute!”<br/><br/>If the skeletons are destroyed, Hanho and Sungwoo will be doomed. If both of them joined hands and fought together, they could beat them, but Sungwoo didn’t want to take the risk.<br/><br/>The reason he decided to fight the goblins was because he could guarantee his safety with the skeletons at the forefront to fight them.<br/><br/>‘I’ve got to control these skeletons because they are supposed to move according to my instructions. Now, what should I do?’<br/><br/>At that moment, the chief goblin’s hand came into his view. It was lifting its left hand and spinning it in the air, but the bracelet on it was very strange.<br/><br/>‘Yep, that’s it!’<br/><br/>The skeleton that had been created first stepped back. Even without one of its hands because it was smashed to pieces, the skeleton jumped into the air after stepping on its colleagues’ backs.<br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/>‘Ugh? Are you going to jump here?’<br/><br/>Based on Sungwoo’s judgment, the skeleton took a very aggressive action, which even he didn’t expect at all. Falling down rapidly, it brandished its hand straight down.<br/><br/>Its dagger cut the chief goblin’s left wrist instantly. Then the red energy of the bracelet disappeared, and the goblin gang was stricken with fear again.<br/><br/>Stunned, the chief goblin kicked the skeleton, which bounced out and rolled down the 1st floor.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it seized the chance to win with that single attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The skeletons, which might look like resurrected zombies to the goblins, stabbed them recklessly and emotionlessly.<br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/>Sometimes there were yellow sparkles coupled with the blunt sounds, which suggested that the goblins were given a fatal blow because of the synergy effect of .<br/><br/><br/><br/>The goblins collapsed all at once. The stairs leading from the 2nd floor to the 1st were full of blood, which dripped down the stairs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, six out of the seven goblins were all killed, and only the chief goblin survived.<br/><br/>It smashed one of the skeletons by wielding the long spear, but that was it.<br/><br/>Two skeletons were spinning around it, stabbing its belly ruthlessly.<br/><br/>In the end, it collapsed in a pool of blood, moaning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, wow…Hahaha…”<br/><br/>As if he was dumbfounded, Hanho began to laugh frivolously. Sungwoo slowly walked down the bloody stairs and checked the chief goblin’s body.<br/><br/>“Ah? Sungwoo, don’t you earn something like items in this case?”<br/><br/>“Yep.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was on the same page. When the gamers hunted goblins, they usually received items.<br/><br/>And his guess was right. Gold sparkled on the chief goblin’s sliced left forearm and the spear he used. It seemed as if the items were shouting, ‘I’m here!”, so Sungwoo could claim them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Name: Crude Spear<br/><br/>Grade: general<br/><br/>Classification: one-handed spear<br/><br/>Effect: Increases attack speed of ‘small-build’ friendly forces (+20%)<br/><br/>Sungwoo put the bracelet on his left wrist, which immediately brought about the effects of the item.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that the ‘small-build’ referred to the goblin. And Sungwoo enjoyed seeing another unexpected effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Name: Madness of the Wilderness<br/><br/>Grade: D<br/><br/>Classification: Buff<br/><br/>Effect: When used, the ‘goblin mercenaries’ will increase their attacks (+10%) and attack speed (+20%) for ten minutes. After that, the cooldown will take one hour&gt;<br/><br/>It seemed that Sungwoo had obtained a very good weapon because the moment the chief goblin used it, he saw the goblin gang’s power becoming much stronger than before.<br/><br/>“Um, I think I obtained a lot.”<br/><br/>Since it was a very dangerous battle, he felt like he was rewarded amply.<br/><br/>Rattle.<br/><br/>At that moment, the one-armed skeleton walked up the stairs with a waddling gait. It was the first to be born as a skeleton, and it cut the chief goblin’s wrist. Right after its attack, it was kicked hard by the chief goblin and fell down the stairs, smashing two of its ribs. Although its body was covered with wounds, it seemed to be more sophisticated.<br/><br/>Sungwoo put his hand on its skull as if he felt proud of it.<br/><br/>“Good job!”<br/><br/>But he pulled his hand back immediately because he still felt uncomfortable. Then it made a loud noise by gnashing its teeth together as if it was satisfied.<br/><br/>Tick, tick.<br/><br/>“Ugh. What did you do a moment ago? Don’t do it again.”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo ordered it, the skeleton stopped doing it, leaving its jaws wide open. It looked really ugly.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, where shall we go now?”<br/><br/>“Well, let’s get out of here first.”<br/><br/>Both of them went to the 1st floor, then headed for the lobby. They confirmed that people had gathered in front of the main gate of the building.<br/><br/>“You guys go into the copy room over there, skeletons! If they see you, they might be so shocked that they will kill you.”<br/><br/>“You’re right. I’m sorry to say this, but I also struck them on the head in the spur of the moment. I think people will scream at the sight of these skeletons.”<br/><br/>In fact, Hanho had wielded the dagger first, thinking that the skeletons were monsters. Fortunately, Hanho was on close terms with Sungwoo, but those who were scared of the skeletons would not be persuaded.<br/><br/>When Sungwoo opened the door of the copy room, the skeletons went inside in a single file line. If anybody opened the door by mistake, he or she could pass out. But who would come to this place to make a photocopy?<br/><br/>There were about 30 people gathered in the lobby. Given that only five of them were holding weapons, it was obvious that there were only a few who could take action when the unidentified cards appeared.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, it was abnormal for them to reach out for such strange cards.<br/><br/>“Come on, everybody! Please come down! We’re contacting the police now, and members of the student council are also checking out what happened!”<br/><br/>A man wearing the student council jumper was shouting at them, with a sword in his right hand and a shield in his left.<br/><br/>“What can the student council do in this situation? Just break open the door!”<br/><br/>One female student, who was about to cry, shouted at him.<br/><br/>But the executive member of the student council shook his head and said, “Well, we tried to break it open in every way, but it didn’t break no matter how hard we struck it.”<br/><br/>“Really? The door can’t be broken?”<br/><br/>The main door was an ordinary glass door.<br/><br/>But the student council executive nodded at her question resolutely.<br/><br/>“Nope, it won’t. So, please calm down and lower your voice so the monsters won’t approach us. Please follow my instructions!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo naturally mingled in with them.<br/><br/>“…Are you Sungwoo?” </div><h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/>One of the executive members of the student council pretended to recognize him. Sungwoo also recognized him. He was Jinsok Lee, and he was two years ahead of him in the same department.<br/><br/>When Sungwoo was a freshman, Jinsuk was in the same group when they went on a department outing. Sungwoo didn’t have good memories of him, though.<br/><br/>Basically Jinsok was an old fossil who insisted on hierarchy. He was also notorious for hitting on girls in the department. Since he was very covetous of a title, he joined the student council.<br/><br/>“Oh, hello.”<br/><br/>Exchanging formal greetings with him, Sungwoo cautiously approached the main door. He was curious as to why Jinsok could not open it.<br/><br/>At the moment, however, Jinso made an annoying expression and shouted, “Hey! Don’t approach the door! It’s dangerous! Damn it!”<br/><br/>He made a big fuss out of it and waved at Sungwoo annoyingly, so Sungwoo stepped back.<br/><br/>Jinsok let out a sigh, then suddenly made a benevolent expression like a saint.<br/><br/>“Phew, I’m sorry. I’m a bit on the edge because I have to pay attention to lots of stuff at the moment. I don’t know what’s going on, but I have to protect our students.”<br/><br/>Well, this is close to an excessive sense of duty. Did Jinsok show this conceited attitude because he was an executive member of the student council? Sungwoo began to feel like he was a nuisance.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, did you also choose a card?”<br/><br/>“Yes, that’s right. Both of us chose the cards. You know Hanho, right?”<br/><br/>“Hello, Jinsuk.”<br/><br/>“Oh, I think I’ve seen you at a certain event before, Hanho. I’m so busy I can’t attend classes often…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo wanted to retort, ‘Why are you attending school then? Because you want to wear that student council uniform?’ But he did not have the heart to speak out.<br/><br/>“…Anyway, you know the current situation is very serious, right? If you have weapons, you should help me protect our students.”<br/><br/>“Sure, we’ll help you.”<br/><br/>“By the way, what is your occupation? Someone like a spearman? Well, are you sure you can help me?”<br/><br/>Looking at Sungwoo holding a crude spear, Jinsok made a frown. Obviously he looked at Sungwoo with contempt.<br/><br/>In fact, Sungwoo himself thought his weapon was worthless compared with the weapons those in other occupations were holding. But his real weapons were clustered about inside the copy room.<br/><br/>‘Well, I don’t need to bother to tell him about it.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded lightly.<br/><br/>“I caught a green monster. It’s called a goblin. It’s tough to confront it even if I have a weapon,” Jinsok said, lifting the shield proudly, “And I’ve chosen a very good card. It is a shield fighter with two stars. If anything happens to you, just hide behind me.”<br/><br/>“Sure,” replied Sungwoo half-heartedly. He thought it ridiculous for Jinsok to brag about the two stars, and he didn’t want to look condescending by arguing that his card had more stars.<br/><br/>At that moment, someone came to Jinsok hurriedly, panting and huffing.<br/><br/>“Sir! I hear the goblins making some faint noise on the stairs.”<br/><br/>He was none other than Minsu who acted cowardly in the lecture hall. It seemed that he was acting as Jinsok’s minion at the moment, but what the heck did he mean by ‘goblins making faint noise?’ Sungwoo barely held the urge to pooh-pooh it.<br/><br/>Anyway, Jinsok appreciated his service by patting him on the shoulder, then strode toward them arrogantly, so much so that one could feel something like heroic resolve in his gait.<br/><br/>“Come down, everybody, please be quiet. The upper floors are crawling. Please hide yourselves inside the cafe slowly. We’re going to guard the entrance.”<br/><br/>Jinsok’s mention of goblins had a chilling effect. Tight-lipped, they began to shuffle into the cafe.<br/><br/>“Hey, Hanho, come here.”<br/><br/>In the meantime, Sungwoo and Hanho approached the main entrance, avoiding Jinsok’s gaze.<br/><br/>Why was he calling their bluff, warning them not to approach with the excuse that he could not break open the glass door?<br/><br/>“Do you see that, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>Like Hanho said, there was a holographic mark on the doorknob, which was a pink chain icon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Boss? Two hours and eleven minutes…’<br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled the doorknob with a jerk, but it would not budge.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I wonder if this is a timed attack. Aren’t we all going to perish if we don’t kill the monsters within that time frame?”<br/><br/>“I’m not sure how the monsters are going to be strengthened, but we obviously have to kill them to get out of here. Don’t ever think foolishly that anybody will come to our rescue.”<br/><br/>In a situation like this, they could not hope for the arrival of the police. Anybody who failed to stay awake would be the first to be killed.<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Hanho approached Jinsok again.<br/><br/>Jinsok opened his mouth, looking at Minsu and Sungwoo, “You know each other, right? Both of you are from the class of 2015, right?”<br/><br/>“Yes, we are,” replied Minsu coldly. He seemed to have felt offended when Sungwoo reproached him in the lecture hall.<br/><br/>“Good. I feel more secure as both of you are under my authority like now. Let’s stay alert and stick it out well,” Jinsok said proudly as if he were a general who burned the bridge behind him. Then he patted the three men on the shoulder one by one.<br/><br/>But Sungwoo tilted his head at his last words.<br/><br/>“Wait a minute… Did you say we would stick it out? Right here?”<br/><br/>“Yes. What’s wrong with that?” Jinsok hysterically retorted. Basically, he hated it when his juniors talked back.<br/><br/>“You saw the message on the door, right?”<br/><br/>“Of course I did! We have to stay here until the rescue team arrives because we can’t get out of here.”<br/><br/>“Rescue team? Do you think the police can come now? If the same thing is happening around the country, it’s impossible for the police to pay attention to us…”<br/><br/>“Hey, you served in the military before, right?”<br/><br/>“Of course.”<br/><br/>“Then how come you don’t know it? The army will move to free us. Everything will be alright then.”<br/><br/>No, that was his vague wishful thinking. It was impossible for the army to help people in every corner of the land.<br/><br/>Of course, it was possible that they could get the army’s help, but it was impossible to expect their help within two hours. It was too complacent to stay still when nobody knew what would happen in two hours. Sungwoo realized it once again after taking a dim view of Jinsok’s complacent attitude.<br/><br/>Sungwoo murmured to himself, ‘I’ve got to wake up and smell the coffee, then adapt myself to the situation accordingly. I’ll be put in danger if I act passively with complacency.’<br/><br/>Without replying, Sungwoo let out a sigh. Jinsok fumed at that.<br/><br/>“Did you just sigh? Damn it, I can’t stand it. You stay out of this! If you want to survive, just stand still. Got it?”<br/><br/>Right at that moment, Minsu stepped back stunned. He shouted, “Jinsok! Go…goblin!”<br/><br/>Squeak! Squeak!<br/><br/>About eight goblins were running down the central stairs.<br/><br/>“Ugh?”<br/><br/>“Oops! Right over there!”<br/><br/>Everybody in the cafe stood up in alarm. There was only one entrance to the cafe, so they could not run away. Jinsok lifted the shield with his trembling hands.<br/><br/>“Anybody with a weapon, come here! Come to the entrance of the cafe! We’ve got to stop them!”<br/><br/>But Minsu yelled again, completely freaking out, “Argh! Jinsok, over there! They’re also coming from the hallway!”<br/><br/>“Damn it, what the fuck are they?”<br/><br/>Jinsok stiffened at the goblins in the shape of scrawny skeletons.<br/><br/>Sungwoo whispered, “They are not evil.”<br/><br/>“What did you say?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo stood at the entrance of the cafe.<br/><br/>“Jinsok, I know you have a strong sense of responsibility, but please wake up and smell the coffee. If a silly guy tries to act like a commander, he might kill others.”<br/><br/>“…What the heck did you say? What the fuck is your occupation?”<br/><br/>“Something good.” </div><h2 id="chapter7">Chapter 7</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            1<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Having said that, Sungwoo then left the cafe. The eight goblins stood frozen on the spot as if they had run into a beast. Then they even screamed and stepped back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak…squeak…<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was because of ‘The Smell of Death’ peculiar to the necromancer. But the goblins seemed to be scared by Sungwoo’s appearance in the eyes of Jinsok and the other people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, their hunting began.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle, rattle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The sound of clattering bones echoed horrifyingly. Those stuck in the cafe were just speechless with their faces frozen, watching the scene through the glass windows. Four skeletons began to massacre the eight goblins ruthlessly.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even Jinsok, who was holding his shield, shuddered at the fighting. He thought he would be killed the moment the goblins appeared. He was even thinking of running away at an opportune time.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>But Sungwoo went forward holding the crude spear in one hand, and began to kill the goblins, escorted by the skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Block the stairs to stop them from fleeing!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo shouted, the one-armed skeleton went round and stood on the first step of the stairs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good job! Keep on blocking them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, Sungwoo didn’t need to shout at the skeleton, but he did so to show everybody that the skeletons were not dangerous. They were under his control and he was the very man who could resolve the situation right now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Only I can succeed in attacking the boss monster.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo intended to kill the boss within the given time frame and escape from the building. He thought that was the rule of the game, and the safest way.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the goblins fell down at the crit. Although it was only a 10% increase in probability, he received the bonus for his attack speed, so he got the buff frequently.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/><br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Synergy: Dagger Thieves Gang<br/><br/><br/><br/>Critical Strike Chance (+10%), gold accumulation (+10%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Item: Madness of the Wilderness<br/><br/><br/><br/>Attack speed increase when dealing with goblins (+20%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If I use the buffs from the bracelet, I don’t think the goblins are a danger, no matter how many appear.’<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>Sungwoo had already adapted to the situation and analyzed it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘But the goblins alone aren’t my enemy. Stronger monsters will come out in the future.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It didn’t matter to him why or how such monsters appeared because he could not figure it out even if he agonized over it. What was important to him right now was to fight the goblins and survive.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, those stuck in the cafe were watching Sungwoo fighting the goblins anxiously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The guy over there is now ordering the skeletons, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think so.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although they could not understand the situation at all, what was happening before their eyes was true. They began to feel relieved gradually, watching him controlling the situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How fortunate we are…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who is he by the way? What’s his major?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh? He seems to be my senior in the department…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now they not only felt relieved that they survived, but they also realized that Sungwoo had saved them. It was sort of their instinct for survival because they wanted to have someone as their guide instinctively in a life-or-death situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As Sungwoo intended, he managed to remind them that he was the man who overcame the crisis at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak…<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo gripped the spear, pulled his shoulder back, and threw it at the last remaining goblin as hard as he could.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The spear was stabbed right into the goblin’s chest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Phew. Good.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the skeletons, his strong subordinates, stood on guard, Sungwoo felt he needed to brush up on his combat skills just in case of contingencies. And his actual killing of the goblin planted a strong impression into the minds of those watching him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Wow!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That guy is really cool. Is he the same guy who used to write something in the Creative Writing Department?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How fortunate we are! We’re so fortunate to have someone like him here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After he was done fighting, Sungwoo looked askance at the bodies of the goblins. But he could not see anything sparkling like gold, which suggested items.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I don’t get items when I kill ordinary goblins?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were crude daggers strewn here and there, but it seemed that the items were given only when he hunted some weighty goblins like the chief goblin he had killed before.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>But there was a message that he could not understand as if he earned something else.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>11<br/><br/>“…Roulette Ticket?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could not figure out what it was right away. As there was nothing like ‘inventory’ that was common in games, he could not verify who issued it. So, he decided to keep in mind the item called ‘Roulette Ticket,’ then focused on what was going on right now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nice job!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo spoke to the skeletons covered in blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, he said that perfunctorily because they were not humans.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tak, tak.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The one-armed skeleton started gnashing its teeth again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, I told you not to do that.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Other skeletons were about to follow suit but stopped at his order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment Jinsok shouted, “…Damn bastards!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head toward Jinsok who was clearly fuming. When he approached Jinsok, four skeletons covered in blood followed him in droves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh…” Jinsok stepped back, astonished, while Minsu had already fled to the end of the cafe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Look, don’t you think I helped you?” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, Jinsok looked down on him a little while ago, watching him holding a crude spear. This time Jinsok nodded silently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo went into the cafe and looked around. There was a total of seven holding weapons, including Hanho, Jinsok, and Minsu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everybody was now looking at Sungwoo. He caught his breath, then kept silent for a moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Actually, it was a typical tactic he used while he was in the army. A veteran master sergeant and a supplies specialist were often used. When something happened, he would gather his soldiers and keep silent momentarily, which heightened their tension amid the silence. When he said something after that, his message usually carried more weight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After he became a platoon leader, Sungwoo also used that tactic often. Of course, this kind of action needed something like ‘authority’ on the part of the man who wanted to use it. In this case, Sungwoo’s brilliant activities a little while ago were more than enough to replace that authority.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, nobody dared to speak while the silence was going on. Everybody fixed their eyes on Sungwoo as if they were waiting for him to say something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, Sungwoo opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As you already saw the message, that door won’t open or get broken because of a strange phenomenon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What should we do now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is there any way for us to open it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their attitude was quite different from the way they dealt with Jinsok. Rather than raising their complaints or shivering with nervousness, they were seeking the solution as if they were meeting an expert. In other words, they began to regard Sungwoo as a man they could trust and rely on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo pointed to the main door with his forefinger and said, “The solution is also in the message over there. We have to catch the boss monster hiding somewhere in this building.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now they were stirred up. Then Sungwoo pointed his finger toward the ceiling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’ve only got two hours left. We have to catch the boss monster hiding somewhere there within two hours.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They became silent again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If we don’t catch it, I’m not sure what will happen…but it must be very unusual. Given that the monster is strengthened, maybe something terrible will happen.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, one of the men raised his hand and said, “I saw that monster.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, I saw that boss monster while I was smoking on the rooftop… I saw a very big monster appearing. Even my professor was killed by that monster…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now it was clear that the destination was the rooftop. </div><h2 id="chapter8">Chapter 8</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“I need more people. Is anyone else going to join me?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, there was no way that they would come forward.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Who would willingly follow Sungwoo to fight the monster even if they were overwhelmed by Sungwoo’s heroic action?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thanks to his brilliant fighting, he could openly encourage them to join him, but even those who chose the occupation cards lowered their heads and hid their weapons behind their backs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I wish I could just stay here…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way, you should go with me.”<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>Sungwoo forcibly pulled Hanho’s arm as he was trying to go into the cafe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You have to stand next to me to provide the buff for the skeletons.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The synergy of  took effect when Sungwoo had five daggers, including Hanho’s.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me give you my dagger.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, I don’t need it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho was speechless when Sungwoo resolutely declined his offer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Even if we flock to the monster, I don’t think we can expect any good results,” said Jisu Yun, the only female volunteer wearing a red tracksuit.<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>She seemed to be on edge, but she was still spunky. She contemptuously looked at those trying to avoid Sungwoo’s eyes by all means.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She continued, “Well, we might be tangled up together in the hallway, which would be really annoying. Look at those human skeletons! What’s the point of taking them with us when they are less valuable than the skeletons?”<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought her daring attitude was nothing more than reckless because nobody knew how strong the boss monster was. Anyway, it was impossible to forcibly take those indisposed for the fight, nor were they likely to be of any help.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, Sungwoo looked at Jinsok and asked, “How about you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At his urging, Jinsok cast his glance down, then looked around as if he was embarrassed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I think I have to stay here to protect the students here, and that’s the duty of the student council…”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Okay, I heard you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thanks…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then stay alert and protect them well.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jinsok didn’t respond at all as if his confidence had disappeared all of a sudden.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go right up to the rooftop by using the elevator because we are not sure how long it will take. Oh, let’s use the stairs instead.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If they used the elevator, they could arrive at the rooftop at once, but there were several risks involved. They were not sure what would come out right after the elevator door opened, and they could be helplessly attacked by the monsters inside the narrow elevator.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo began to walk up the stairs, the four skeletons escorted him up close. Hanho followed close behind, and Jisu, the only woman volunteer, followed right behind him, wearing a saber on her waist. She said she killed two goblins right after the game started.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“Dang it. I might be in real trouble because of you, man,” Hanho grumbled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You still don’t want to join the army?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I wish I was already in military training camp and passed day one if I opened my eyes now. Ah! You remember I saw some strange letters in the morning? Look, I’m right!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So what’s the big deal? Do you think you can change the situation now?”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>The message in the sky that Hanho said he saw in the morning could be the harbinger of the current situation. But it seemed like there was nothing he could change for now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There is one thing you can change,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The day you’d be killed.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you try to escape foolishly, you will be the first to be killed. Admiral Sunshin Lee of the Chosun Dynasty was right when he said that if you wanted to survive….”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>But he could not afford to crack a joke anymore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak! Squeak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Goblins began popping out on the stairs of the second floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Both of you confront them from the rear!”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>When Sungwoo looked up the stairs leading to the third floor, the skeletons began to attach themselves to the goblins ruthlessly. But two goblins rushed out of the lecture hall on the second floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh! Sungwoo, send me a skeleton here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While Hanho was struggling to grasp the dagger in his hand, Jisu pulled out her saber. The blade, which was about 55 centimeters long, shined brightly because of the fluorescent light.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if to prove she cut two goblins, Jisu boldly moved forward and swung the saber down on them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Her saber cut through the goblin’s left eye and right ribs with one stroke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woosh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was just one blow. She ignored the message, ‘+10 gold,’ which appeared before her eyes, then adjusted her posture and stabbed the goblin charging toward her from the left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, she showed that anybody could easily kill the goblins as long as they stayed alert because the goblin was the weakest monster that one could kill just by smashing them with a desk.<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>But Hanho didn’t hide his admiration of her skills as his mouth was agape. Her pale face was smeared with blood, but she wiped it off with the sleeve of her red tracksuit.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“Wow, Sungwoo, she is really cool!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Hanho turned back to praise her, he saw six goblin bodies strewn on the floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Ah?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was now witnessing a more brutal massacre. Sungwoo was pulling out a spear stuck in one of their bodies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blinking his eyes, Hanho nodded and said, “…I’m wrong. Admiral Sunshin Lee was right.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like the admiral said, those who were determined to fight while risking their lives would survive, but if they hoped to survive anyway, there was a high probability that they would be killed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Why? When you leveled up, you became stronger and you would have more chances of surviving.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They now succeeded in occupying the second floor and went up to the third.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they were about to walk up to the fourth floor, Hanho found something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, isn’t that Prof. Hwang over there?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Somebody was lying in one corner of the hallway with his face down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, Professor? Professor!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was Prof. Hwang who had been in charge of Sungwoo’s AM class. When Sungwoo rushed to him, he noticed that half his shirt was soaked with blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Cough! Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, I’m here. Are you alright?”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>The professor was far from okay. His right arm was cut in tatters as if it had been grounded by a mixer, so much so that there was a pool of blood under his butt.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“What happened to you, Professor…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo… almost all the students in my class were killed because of me… Aaah!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The professor began screaming hysterically as if he was having a seizure.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo tried to calm him down by gently pressing his shoulders.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please calm down! What happened?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thanks to you, my students and I fled to the research room first. Cough! Then we moved up to the rooftop because we could not stay there any longer. I just followed the contingency manual, so I insisted we move to the rooftop.”<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>Oh my god! Sungwoo murmured to himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We found a more horrible monster there, and the students who followed me with total trust…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t have to listen any further. Obviously all of them must have been killed by the boss monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, never go to the rooftop…You should survive…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was his last message. Then a new message appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Title: Revenge for the professor<br/><br/><br/><br/>Type: ‘Rescue’ or ‘Neglect’ the killed professor<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Goal: Kill the boss monster inside the building<br/><br/><br/><br/>Reward: Exclusive skill<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>Seeing your professor dying before your eyes will make a deep sense of guilt wash over you until the last moment. As someone who has held and wielded the reins of death, you can get revenge by killing the enemy or neglecting this ordinary weak professor’s death. The choice is yours.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*You have to follow the attacking time as set in the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*Your choice will affect your ‘fate.’&gt;<br/><br/>8<br/><br/>‘Fate? Is this something like a decisive turning point?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Depending on what Sungwoo chose, either Rescue or Neglect, it seemed that his skills would be affected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t have to mull over it. It wasn’t because he felt sorry about the professor, but because he had to catch the boss monster anyway. </div><h2 id="chapter9">Chapter 9</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Now Sungwoo wanted to kill the boss monster even more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Why do we have to go through this damned thing?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had been obsessed with adapting himself to the imminent situation and seeking survival, but Sungwoo began questioning everything for the first time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, is it really okay for us to go to the rooftop?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even before Sungwoo replied, the skeletons went up the stairs. The door of the top floor soon appeared. Then Sungwoo flung it open.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>1<br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had never climbed to the rooftop of the Humanities and Social Sciences building before. The last time he went there was when he practiced dancing because he could not find a proper place for practicing before the freshman talent show.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>“Damn it…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right now, this place has become a sort of ‘dungeon’ for the goblins. The goblins were in the thick of making a tent by using all kinds of clothes they removed from the bodies of the students with the lockers and all kinds of objects they took from the hallway as a wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Piling up thick textbooks here and there, they were making a fire in the plastic trash bin after ripping the books apart.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oops… he’s my classmate…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At one end of the rooftop they were busy taking the clothes off the bodies. One goblin was drawing a strange pattern on a dead female student’s white shirt with a red marker.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>“What the fuck…” Jisu cursed in a low voice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The three including Sungwoo stood frozen at the entrance of the rooftop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how well they adapted to this crazy situation by now, they could not insensitively turn a blind eye to what was going on right before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt scared all of a sudden. Why did he dare to come up to this place? On the other hand, he felt other feelings surging deep within his heart. At first, he could keep calm because he thought he was facing an uncontrollable phenomenon. But what was happening on the rooftop made him upset. Why should he or they have to go through this? However, the more he thought about it, the more cool-headed he became. After all, he knew he was weak compared to them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Phew!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were killed because they were weak, so Sungwoo, Hanho, and Jisu needed to be strong.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, the goblin tearing a pair of blue jeans with a dagger turned its head toward them.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>Squeak, squeak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the goblin screeched, all the goblins gathered on the rooftop flocked to it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak, squeak, squeak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were about 20 of them in total.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They blocked the three and expressed joy, showing their sick smiles. Perhaps they seemed to think they outnumbered Sungwoo and the other two.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, how about escaping this time…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But even before Hanho finished his words, the skeletons rushed forward.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>‘Put up a strong resistance.’<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Reflecting Sungwoo’s intuition, the four skeletons stood shoulder to shoulder, blocking the entrance to the rooftop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, Sungwoo lifted his left hand. Then the red bracelet’s ‘Madness of the Wilderness’ on his wrist responded immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woowoong—<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The hollow eyes of the skeletons sparkled brightly, and their hands were empowered with energy spirits. Right at that moment, the goblins charged toward the skeletons like a herd of angry wild dogs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the skeletons, standing firmly at the entrance, resisted their attack. While blocking their attack with their left forearms, the skeletons inflicted deep stabs with their daggers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Their attack speed is obviously very fast.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the goblins mounted an attack, the skeletons fought back with double the force. Even the force on the tips of the blades was clearly visible in Sungho’s eyes, which helped them pierce through not only the goblins’ swords but also their knucklebones carrying the swords. And that led to their instant deaths.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The first four goblins fighting at the forefront fell down in three seconds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Just think of these skeletons as our shield!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shouting like that, Sungwoo heaved his spear over the skulls of the skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The skeletons, which were 120 cm tall, served as a sort of barricade. Thanks to them, Sungwoo and the other two could freely attack the goblins safely and unilaterally outside their attack range.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu, who was tall, reached out and wielded her saber over the skeletons. But Hanho, who was holding a dagger, was standing in the back blankly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! I thought I chose the good stuff, but these are swarming with maggots!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho picked up two daggers just in case, but they were useless.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In an act of desperation, Hanho threw one of the daggers at the goblins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It directly hit a goblin’s forehead standing in the rear. It fell to the ground immediately.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Oh, I hit him! Didn’t I do well?”<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>During his middle school days, the so-called ‘chopstick-throwing game’ was popular among students. Their target was the outer wall of the school, but they were caught by the principal and given harsh discipline. Ever since then, they no longer played the game. Looking back, it was the only moment Hanho emerged as the strongest winner in the game.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Now that he gained confidence, Hanho drew another dagger and threw it quickly at the goblins. This time, he accurately hit the forehead of a goblin standing at a distance. For him, it was a very easy two kills.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“I’ve found my talent!”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>When the three fiercely attacked with the skeletons standing at the forefront, the goblins were visibly hesitant as if their fighting spirit had been broken.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak…squeak…<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter10">Chapter 10</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            1<br/><br/> <br/><br/>In no time, two skeletons were resurrected among the goblins’ bodies to replace the perished skeletons, but one of them was immediately smashed to pieces with a heavy blow the moment it stood up. Its skull was thrown toward Sungwoo, but he barely avoided it. It hit the door of the rooftop, then shattered.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>The bodies of the goblins, which became the material of the skeletons, were strewn everywhere, but it was impossible to resurrect all of them indefinitely.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it, my mana…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The required number of mana per skeleton was 5 points, and only four skeletons could be created at the moment. Of course, there was a steady increase in mana, but that alone was not enough.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Swoosh! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, something was thrown at the chief goblin, but it barely blocked it by lifting its left hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, you blocked it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>An old goblin dagger was stabbed into its forearm. Hanho threw it, but it didn’t seem to inflict any significant damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But, veins stood out on its forehead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, that bastard was hit, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Yep, you hit it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho stepped back, frightened, but the chief goblin began to charge toward him at full speed. It sprung up at him, lifting the heavy club with both hands. The goblin was threatening enough to make Hanho scream.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh! Aaaah!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the skeletons came running and blocked the attack, and Hanho fled away quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oops! Thanks, guys!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the chief goblin’s strike smashed three skeletons instantly. The one-armed skeleton, the only survivor, had one of its ribs ripped apart when it was caught by the tip of the chief goblin’s club.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Undaunted by the impact, the skeleton lowered its head and stabbed the dagger into the top of the goblin’s foot.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a screech, the chief goblin kicked the skeleton with its other foot, which threw the skeleton to the locker on the other side. Sungwoo felt heartbroken to see its skull cracked by the shock.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>Then he confirmed that Jisu was sneaking behind its back. He tried not to watch her so she would not be caught.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She now wielded the saber at it, which caused a long cut on its back. If it had not moved or sensed her attack at the last moment, she could have beheaded it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dang it, I could have killed that monster…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Smacking her lips, she stepped back and shook her saber in the air to dust it off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘That girl is not an ordinary woman.’<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>Obviously, the way she brandished the saber was far from normal. Sungwoo was aware that because she was wearing a tracksuit, she was a graduate of the college of physical education, but he also felt something extraordinary in her sword skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Her constant brandishing of the sword was clearly a strategic move to throw the chief goblin into confusion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I should also move strategically.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the three skeletons that he resurrected by using 15 mana surrounded it. He made sure they distanced themselves so that they could not be smashed all at once by the club.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Anyway, we three are the main attackers. I have to use the skeletons as the shields to stop the boss monster from jumping at us.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Urgh…<br/><br/><br/><br/>The boss monster curled up, bleeding all over its body. It seemed to have taken up a defensive position because its hasty attack backfired.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Attack it from behind.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo thought about it, the skeleton behind the boss monster moved. Of course, it could not mount an ambush because it was gnashing its teeth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment the monster wielded the club, Sungwoo quickly hurled his spear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The timing was good, but the spear barely passed by its left ear. However, its outer ear was broken apart, with blood dripping down its shoulder.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Argh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Raging with anger, the boss monster charged toward the skeleton nearby and wielded the club. Sungwoo told the skeleton to avoid the attack quickly, but the monster was much faster.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He had used the remaining mana to resurrect another skeleton, but that was it. Now there were only three skeletons left.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Noticing that, the boss monster looked around, the light in its eyes changing. Actually, it was counting the remaining skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then it let out a disgusting laugh peculiar to a goblin, which suggested that it believed that it had seized the chance to win.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“Ugh? Laughing at us? You bastard, get this!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho quickly threw a dagger at the monster, but the goblin lifted the club high to block the dagger easily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho…why did you utter something when you attacked it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Aha?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked around with a sigh. One of the three including him could be killed if this fight dragged on. If the boss monster could keep fighting despite its serious wounds, all of them could be killed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Now I know why it’s the boss monster. I need a decisive blow to kill it. Let me check the weapons first…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo fortunately found a couple of long swords near the all-in-one desk in one corner. It seemed that somebody who had chosen the swordmaster occupation was killed by the boss monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He furtively approached the desk and grabbed the two swords and ordered in his mind,<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Two of you, charge toward it!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two skeletons simultaneously attacked the boss monster from the left and right, but the boss brandished the club with a faint smile. They were smashed even before they were close enough.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But at that moment, something was thrown over its head. It was a long sword which flew over its head and dropped on the other side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Actually, it landed in somebody’s hand safely, who was none other than the one-armed skeleton. It waddled as it held the sword that was as tall as itself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And Sungwoo also held another sword in his hand on the other side.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the synergy created by the mix of the three swords between Sungwoo, Jisu, and Hanho.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>A yellow energy aura was visible on the blades of their swords.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But there appeared another synergy, which was quite unexpected.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Blue energy aura was visible on the skeleton’s remaining arm and its blade .<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“Good. Hanho, when you attack the boss monster, don’t say anything. Only make a sound when you are certain that you can kill it. Got it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Really?”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Hanho looked at him with a strange expression. He was lifting something laboriously that had a sword on the side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get this hellish all-in-one desk!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lifting it over his head quickly, Sungwoo charged toward the boss monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was his first weapon that killed goblins with one blow in the past.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Jisu and the one-armed skeleton also moved simultaneously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Who the hell made this terrible invention for?<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>The students’ question and resentment of this all-in-one desk prompted angry responses around the campus in the past. But it was only today that Sungwoo felt its use keenly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This is the best blunt weapon and shield.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He had already killed three goblins with the blunt desk. And this time, he was rushing to the boss monster while holding that heavy desk over his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>How could he dash with that heavy desk? Obviously, the boss monster was embarrassed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Caught between a rock and a hard place, it assumed an awkward defensive posture. If it made a wrong move, Jisu or the one-armed skeleton’s attack would definitely land on him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it had made a bad choice. It didn’t realize until then that getting stabbed would’ve been better.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Swoosh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment the heavy desk made of strong boards and iron was thrown at its head, the boss monster realized that it could not block the desk.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although it covered its head with its hands, it staggered with the impact, and Jisu quickly cut its right thigh. It hurriedly turned to the right, but this time the one-armed skeleton stabbed the monster’s ribs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blood was gushing from its side, soaking the ground with blood under its feet. </div><h2 id="chapter11">Chapter 11</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Like a wolf hunting a big prey, the skeleton was ripping apart the boss monster’s flesh bit by bit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Argh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Screaming insanely, the big monster wielded the club in all directions, only pointing it into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Swoosh! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nice shot!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now Hanho’s dagger landed squarely. When the dagger was lodged into its shoulder, its left shoulder immediately dropped. And it was caught off guard completely now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Now is the time. Sacrifice yourself!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grabbing the sword afresh, Sungwoo ordered the skeleton in his heart. Then the one-armed skeleton boldly charged toward the boss monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Goodbye. Thanks for your great job.’<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>Although the skeleton stuck it out for a long time and fought well at the decisive moment, it was time for it to sacrifice itself for victory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ahhhhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a roar, the boss monster, which was physically a total wreck now, wielded the club toward the skeleton’s skull. It would be smashed to pieces by the club, but Sungwoo and Jisu would be able to seize the perfect chance to kill it. Looking for the chance, they jumped at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But…<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Ugh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The one-armed skeleton gently hit back the boss monster’s big club just like a master of martial arts!<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Ah!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the moment when  was activated. With the probability of 88%, it blocked the boss monster’s first attack! However, that was not the end of the story.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When it mounted another attack this time, the big monster staggered, losing its balance…<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Urgh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The one-armed skeleton’s sword stabbed its neck deeply.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cough, cough.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the big monster’s muscular body helplessly collapsed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo, who was about to attack with the sword, stopped with a bitter expression. Jisu, who was on the verge of attacking from the other side, also slowed down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? It’s over?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, that skeleton guy… what did it do before it perished?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No idea… I once killed it with that heavy all-in-one desk. In my opinion, this all-in-one desk is the world’s strongest item.”<br/><br/>9<br/><br/>He had a point. Even if its arms were cut and was kicked around several times, the skeleton survived and faced the boss monster to finally kill it. It was this desk, however, that Sungwoo used to kill the skeleton with a single blow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But a red light began to emit from its body for some reason.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At a glance, Sungwoo felt that the skeleton’s build had been strengthened. And there was a red pattern inscribed on its forehead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that? Why did you make a strange tattoo without my approval?”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Of course, the fallen skeleton could not reply, so Sungwoo opened his ‘list of subordinates’ to check the details.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter12">Chapter 12</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>It was clear that Hanho envied her item. Looking down at his item furtively, he smacked his lips and put on his hood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the other hand, Sungwoo didn’t experiment with the new skill  because he had already used up all his mana to resurrect five skeletons.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“Let me test it later… For now, let’s get out of here.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>After killing the boss, they walked back to the first floor.<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Around that time, the lobby on the first floor was dominated by silence. Although the main door was opened with the killing of the boss monster, nobody had gotten wind of it yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In particular, Jinsok was pacing up and down in the lobby. Although he said he was doing it on the pretext of defending the entrance to the cafe, he was fully ready to flee at any time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way…Jinsok…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, Minsu, with his face turning white, went out of the cafe while holding a sword awkwardly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh. What?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is it really okay for us to keep staying here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jinsok frowned at that question because he also had been listening to all kinds of complaints from the people stuck in the cafe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“People are making a fuss, complaining that they should have followed Sungwoo to kill the boss monster. They say they should have listened to Sungwoo, arguing they should join him even now… Listening to them, I feel like…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Jinsok blurted out foul words, Minsu shut his mouth. Jinsok’s face was turning red. By nature, he flew off the handle at even the slightest things, but he thought that he was restraining from doing so because he was an executive member of the student council.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Son of bitch! These bastards are talking bullshit when I am trying my best to protect them.”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>In fact, Jinsok was thinking of running away when something bad happened, but the moment he got upset, he no longer thought about it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And he thought they were a bunch of ingrates who didn’t understand what was going on. After all, he could not hold back his anger and went back into the cafe, then became angry at them suddenly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Hey, what the heck are you all complaining about?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Alarmed by his angry tone, they were embarrassed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the fuck. I can’t risk my life to protect you anymore. So, if you want to go out, just go ahead!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then one tall man stood up and asked, “Hey, what the heck are you talking about? Go where?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you want to grumble about staying here, just get out of here. Go to the rooftop and be killed along with that damn bastard Sungwoo.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Do you think this is your place?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m protecting you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You are protecting us? The man who climbed to the rooftop is protecting us, not you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bet! Why are you angry with us? What did you do for us?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please lower your voice… Don’t you know you are now putting us in jeopardy?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As everybody complained about him, Jinsok finally lost his temper.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fuck. I’ve been trying to keep my temper in check since my high school days, but because of you dickheads…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Dickhead?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, dickhead! Come on and tell me. What? Sungwoo Yu? That bastard protecting you? That bastard went up to the rooftop and was killed! He was killed because he wanted to show off!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why are you silent? Are you scared? Come over and tell me, you bastards! Why are you tight-lipped?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, they were looking at somebody behind Jinsok.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why did you say I was killed? I’m alive!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Jinsok turned and caught his breath he was startled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my god!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Five skeletons were looking up at him, and Sungwoo was standing behind them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did you wish I was killed?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, you’re a real eyesore!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo walked toward the main door with long strides and flung it open.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then the door, which couldn’t move at all up until a moment ago, opened smoothly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Standing in front of the open door, he turned and looked at Jinsok.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you have anything to say to me? Just come forward and tell me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the icy atmosphere in the lobby, everybody fixed their eyes on Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Weren’t you going to say something? Just come here and say it again.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking at him quietly, he didn’t reply. He just stood in place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? This guy boasted he was a strong man in front of us…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, he was nothing from the beginning. He acted so arrogantly, pretending to be high and mighty.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although Jinsok vented his surging anger until a moment ago, he was unusually calm now. Even though he heard them speaking ill of him with derisive insults, he didn’t get angry.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you don’t have anything to say, let’s get out. I hope you can watch your language in the future.”<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He turned after saying that, and left the Humanities and Social Sciences building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle, rattle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The five skeletons escorted him, walking with wide intervals while checking the surroundings. Jisu and Hanho were among the guard team.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, it’s quiet here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t see them, either.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nodding, Sungwoo spoke to those inside the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You are safe now, so come out quietly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then the students began coming out cautiously. Jinsok and Minsu also followed them awkwardly. Checking Sungwoo’s expression, both of them looked very depressed and pale.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Obviously the goblins walk around in groups.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo looked out the window on the fourth floor, he saw more than ten goblins grouped together. Obviously they must be hiding somewhere on campus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oops, look at the bodies over there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What should we do…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The bodies of the students killed by monsters were strewn everywhere on campus. They were seen in the middle of the playground, parking lot, and among the woods. The bodies of monsters were also found, but there were not many.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nonetheless, there must be people who are trying to adapt to the current situation. If they stayed alert, they could easily beat the goblins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, don’t you see people over there?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, he noticed a group of people on the playground. There were about 20 of them. As if they noticed Sungwoo and his party, somebody started waving at them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Most of them are armed with weapons.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he looked at them he noticed that about 15 were holding weapons. Even if they didn’t own the weapons from selecting the occupation cards, they were carrying weapons that they could use anyway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They survived the battle with the goblins.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo walked toward, Jinsok who had kept his mouth shut suddenly ran toward someone, pretending to know him.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Hey, it’s nice to see you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man had a heavy build, and he was wearing a student council jumper like Jinsok. The unique thing was that he also wore the so-called chainmail, sort of chain armor, inside the jumper. Given that he was carrying a long bayonet on his back, he seemed to have leveled up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, Jinsok! You have survived!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, I knew you would survive! I’m so lucky to meet you here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Making a big fuss, Jinsok went running to him and hugged him. It seemed that Jinsok took pains to flatter him while talking nonsense while the guy didn’t know anything about how Jinsok behaved in the Humanities and Social Sciences building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…He’s the president of the student council,” Jisu said, making a bitter expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jinsok went to him and whispered something with his hand around the man’s back. Then the man raised his head a bit and looked at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He is talking about you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, it’s too obvious.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jinsok would not have said anything good about Sungwoo, but the expression on his face didn’t change. He approached Sungwoo calmly, then spoke to him and the other students.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m Daesung Park, the president of the student council. I guess you must have gone through a lot of distress. We went through the same thing and survived after beating the monsters.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What he said was not a lie because about twenty students armed with weapons were standing behind him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You’ll be safe if you stay with us.”<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter13">Chapter 13</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>So, the survivors from the Humanities and Social Sciences building mingled with the people who belonged to the student council. Then Daesung cast his glance at Sungwoo. In fact, he glanced over the skeletons around Sungwoo with a wary eye.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What are these monsters?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As you know, they are from the occupation card that I chose.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You chose the monsters that kill humans?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo instantly sensed that this guy’s words were pregnant with wicked intentions. This guy chose offensive and negative words on purpose. Besides, he raised his voice so those around him could hear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘You’re trying to portray me as a dangerous man.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>This guy was as rude as Jinsok, but in fact, he was much worse than Jinsok. He was like a cunning chap accustomed to bullying people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m sorry to tell you this, but if you join my group, please smash all these monsters here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, I can’t,” Sungwoo replied without any hesitation. Daesung snorted with derision, then looked around at the people and shrugged his shoulders proudly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously he was trying to add more weight to his argument by making use of mob psychology.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you going to keep these unidentified and disgusting monsters that kill humans around us?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Disgusting? Well, actually they are…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But they’re cute.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Hanho, be quiet!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clap, clap.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Be quiet, you guys. Anyway, I’m sorry, but I can’t. Smashing them is like disarming my weapons. Can you walk around without a weapon in this situation if I tell you to do so?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Um, I don’t know. But we can protect you, right? You will be safer here than you are with these several monsters that look sloppy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then Daesung stuck out his chest furtively.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What the heck? Does he want me to look at the chainmail inside his jumper?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo laughed sarcastically. How could he describe the skeletons as sloppy monsters? He didn’t know anything about them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How can I trust you? Well, my trust in you has almost disappeared because of what you said a moment ago. I was with a man who said the same thing up until a little while ago.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While saying so, he looked at Jinsok. Although he was silent, dejected by Sungwoo’s reproach a little while ago, Jinsok was clearly getting angry at the moment. He was like a puppy bearing its teeth beside its master.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, if you insist. I’m sorry, but you can’t join my group here. Think carefully. It’s not time for you to keep your head up. I’ll give you one last chance. Let’s stay alert and think about it carefully.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, Jisu came forward and shouted, “Oh, you’re speaking on both sides of the conversation! Did we say we wanted to join your group? Do you think you guys in the student council play a great role? If you think that way, that’s sick!”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Daesung wiggled his eyebrows at her thunderous condemnation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…You must be the chair of the social physical education department, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nope. Does it matter at all when my school’s gone bankrupt? Hey, you, 25-year-old Daesung Park! How long are you going to play with your title?”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that Jisu had hated him for a long time. Otherwise, she would not have treated him so harshly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, would you please calm down and come to our side? You’ll regret it later if you don’t.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu blew a raspberry at him.<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>“Please stop being hypocritical! You are pretending to do something good for the school, but I know you siphoned off several million won by fabricating receipts with the stage setup company during the campus festival. It’s me who tipped the school paper off about it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Daesung tried his best to calm down, but he lost his face because of her personal attack. And the students who heard her began murmuring.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, he lowered his head and let out a long sigh.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ha…I can’t help it anymore. Please go away. The monsters will go crazy if you keep disturbing them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, please. Damn it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu turned away first and Sungwoo also followed suit without any regret. Although Hanho made an annoyed expression, he also followed Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then Daesung suddenly shouted at them angrily, “You’re going to have regrets. We’d be better off standing together in this situation. Have you heard about the synergistic effect? You will regret going around in such a small group right before you are killed. Assholes…”<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>The other students were left behind with the student council members. No matter how reliable Sungwoo looked, they obviously didn’t want to leave such a large crowd and join Sungwoo’s party.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, I’m sorry to ask you this, but do you have some beef with Daesung? He said you’re the chair of the social physical education department…” he asked cautiously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, he really sucks. He’s a wealthy guy, so he has been wandering on campus to pick up women. Several female students, who are my juniors, were betrayed by him… He happened to have an important title, and he is playing the hypocrite now. But his nature will never change.”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“I see.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What a bad guy!” Hanho shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party decided to ‘exit the campus’ as their first goal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And they agonized over the best way to get out of the school.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think there are lots of monsters in places where people are crowded. They looked like they were just killing humans from the beginning,” Jisu said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She had a point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then let’s avoid the building as much as possible and get out of here by using the trail on the hill behind the campus. It leads to the main gate and there are few people there in the morning.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They headed for the hill behind the campus. There was a trail with old wooden stairs and several benches along the path.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s so quiet here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although it was a hill at the back of the campus, it could not be quiet given that around 10,000 students were attending the college every day. The stillness there was unsettling rather than peace.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wait a minute…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While walking up the trail, Sungwoo suddenly stopped. Then the skeletons walking ahead also stopped.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A light breeze blew over the hill and passed over their heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, what’s wrong?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shush!….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lowering his body, Sungwoo raised his index finger, pointing toward a shady place among the trees.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rustle—<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something was standing tall there. It seemed like a fight had broken out because there were several goblin bodies here and there, with pools of blood around. And a large axe was stuck in the head of a goblin’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a guy who seemed to be the winner of the battle drew an axe, sensing human footsteps. He furtively turned toward Sungwoo’s party.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Startled, Hanho pulled out a dagger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck… It’s bigger than the boss goblin!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a green-skinned orc with the fangs jutting out its mouth, a huge animal as tall as two meters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lifting the axe high, the orc roared, signaling the start of the fight. It blindly charged toward them with the axe. Sungwoo pulled out his sword while the skeletons dispersed in all directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Good. New material for new skeletons has appeared.”<br/><br/>12<br/><br/>Sungwoo expected that other monsters would also appear. Logically speaking, orcs would appear next after the goblins.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Facing the orc, however, Sungwoo felt like he was frozen. He felt outmatched by the huge animal, something quite different from goblins the size of children. It looked like he was now confronting a professional wrestler because the orc had a muscular build and was taller than two meters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get out of here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Jisu shouted first, Sungwoo and Hanho threw themselves into the woods. So did the skeletons. At that moment, the orc, which launched itself at them, was rooted around the spot where they were standing until a little while ago. Just like a wild warrior or a wild pig, it ruthlessly charged at them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What a crazy creature!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho stood up, pushed his way through the woods, and cursed at the monster. How could it charge at him at full speed and throw itself at him simply because they locked eyes?<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orc landed below the stairs and put the axe on its shoulder, staring at Sungwoo’s party. Then it blew its nose hard excitedly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s coming to us again!” </div><h2 id="chapter14">Chapter 14</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo shouted, it stepped on the wooden stairs and began to climb up with incredible speed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp—<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Jisu, who was closest to the orc, drew her saber, then boldly clashed against its axe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu collapsed and helplessly dropped to her knees. Fortunately, she didn’t lose the saber she was holding.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, she saw the monster smiling at her faintly while looking down, then the shining blade of the axe was pointing toward her head…<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bam!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A skeleton was smashed before her eyes, with its pieces scattered over her head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Escape quickly!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At Sungwoo’s urging, she rolled over to the side. The blade of the axe barely missed her, but the wooden stairs were cut in half.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the one-armed skeleton that came forward to confront the orc. Drawing its sword, it waddled down the stairs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hhhhheeh—-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking at the skeleton, the orc sneered. It seemed that the orc thought the skeleton was a piece of cake given that it had massacred numerous goblins until now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like it did before, the orc unleashed a strong blow onto the skeleton, which was enough.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it didn’t work this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment the orc’s axe clashed with the saber, it slid off as if it had tried to cut an oily wall. It was the result of the synergy effect: . After all, it lost its balance without controlling its heavy push.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Kick it!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seizing the chance, Sungwoo issued an order. The skeleton then pushed the orc’s upper body with its short leg, and the monster fell down the stairs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a truly moving moment for the skeleton, which had been kicked around until now, to kick a monster back.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“Jisu, climb up here! Let’s move to a flat place first!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was dangerous for them to confront such a tall and resilient monster in a rugged place. In particular, there was no space to retreat with the stair topography like this.<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although she clashed with the orc only once, her right hand was trembling hard. It was not because she was scared or hurt, but because she was upset.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Obviously I blocked its attack, but how could I collapse like that?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>She felt like it was unfair. She once again felt a sense of deprivation caused by the innate physical differences, which she had felt all the time as a female athlete. There were many things one could earn without making any effort in this world, and that was especially true in the arts and sports area.<br/><br/>8<br/><br/>“Never get too close to the monster. We have to kill it just like we did with the boss monster,” shouted Sungwoo. He was moving into the woods with the skeletons to block the orcs movement with lots of obstacles.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“…Whew, got it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Catching her breath, she followed him into the woods. She had almost forgotten the most important lesson: survival was not competition.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In no time the giant monster walked up the stairs with big strides, then found Sungwoo’s party staring at it from the trees. There was a murderous look in its eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go as we planned. As always, the skeletons will sacrifice themselves first.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, Sungwoo looked at the goblins’ bodies in the forest. A moment ago he resurrected one of them as a skeleton. He had enough mana to create more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘But I should not waste mana.’<br/><br/>8<br/><br/>The giant monster now charged at them blindly, but Sungwoo’s party went deeper into the woods and ran around here and there. They rendered the orc’s charging useless. With its heavy weight and a huge axe, it could not even turn around easily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, five skeletons surrounded the orc. They appeared from behind the trees.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good, now’s the time!” Hanho shouted. Then the five skeletons and Hanho’s three daggers flew toward the orc at the same time.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Clang, clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Most of them were blocked by the axe, but Hanho’s dagger pierced its back. The moment it flinched, the four skeletons started crazily attacking it with bare hands, which was something completely unexpected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, the orc was not quite ready for this kind of blitz. Attacking with bare hands? Was it their suicide attack?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The giant monster broke the skull of the skeleton attacking head on, and smashed another one attacking on the left. But its arms gradually got heavier.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, two skeletons were holding its arms tightly. It tried to break loose from one of them by grabbing the legs hurriedly, but it barely pulled out its legs.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo, Jisu, and the one-armed skeleton rushed for a coordinated attack. The orc tried to wield the axe, but it could hardly do so because of the two skeletons stuck on its arms like leeches.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Avoiding the slow-moving axe, Jisu brandished her saber which cut the orc’s thigh and dealt a blow to its vital points, namely a long cut on its quadriceps. No matter how strong it was, the orc could not help but collapse with the fatal wounds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Argh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, the orc fell, going down on one knee. Seizing the chance, Sungwoo cut its arm holding the axe with his sword. Lastly, the one-armed skeleton sprang at him to stab its neck deeply.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a screech, the orc’s eyes darkened.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>2<br/><br/>It was a perfect joint attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Patrol leader? This orc was tougher than the ordinary ones?”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Whew…but I think it was not as tough as the boss monster,” said Jisu, dusting off the blood on her blade. Sungwoo was preparing to resurrect the fallen orc.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I think our teamwork was good, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>7<br/><br/>It seemed that Sungwoo could not control the orc as his subordinate yet. So, he resurrected a goblin’s body to make a skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s take a brief break here. If we see such monsters wandering in droves, we have to run away,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While taking a break, Sungwoo thought about using  by using the orc’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, I forgot to ask you until now, but which card did you choose, Jisu? I was so absent-minded… Well, you might know it, but I’m a Necromancer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I thought you were. I’m a Tiger Warrior. Since I like pink best after red, I picked the pink card. It had three stars!”<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>The Tiger Warrior was part of the regular army specializing in hunting beasts including tigers during the Chosun Dynasty in Ancient Korea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that there was a wide variety of occupations in the cards, not just those that appeared in general fantasy stories.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As for me, I had one star…” said Hanho.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>It was not clear how much difference there was in the grades of the occupation cards divided according to the number of stars, but the demonstration of their fighting competence up until now seemed to roughly display it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After a brief rest, Sungwoo stood before the orc’s body after confirming that his mana was filled to a certain point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Bone Weapon Formation.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he murmured the words, the remaining mana was all used up, and the orc’s skin and intestines turned into ashes and dissipated. A small menu appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Sword (lowest grade/six swords)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blunt Weapon (low grade/five blunt weapons)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Spear (lowest grade/two spears)<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Arrow (lowest grade/four arrows) &gt;<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>The classification criteria were unknown, but it seemed that the quality of weapons depended on the weapon material available at the moment. After thinking deeply for a moment, Sungwoo chose the blunt weapon, which had a higher grade compared to the rest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then orc’s bones shook before they were entwined with each other and made some shapes. Soon, five blunt weapons fell on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, even that’s weapon material?!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bet.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo picked up one of the blunt weapons.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As the skill grade was low, they could not expect good performance, but it was much better than the ‘crude daggers’ that the goblins used.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Take it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle, rattle.<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter15">Chapter 15</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Each of the five skeletons held a blunt weapon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then Sungwoo used the orc’s leather belt to knot the sword on the one-armed skeleton’s back, so it could make use of the synergies,  and , at any time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The sword feels heavier now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the synergy of , which reduced sword weight, disappeared, Jisu murmured while lifting her saber. Sungwoo also felt the great effects of the 50% sword weight reduction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, a new synergy soon became active.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Ah? Wait a minute.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if he recalled something, Sungwoo unknotted the sword from the one-armed skeleton’s back and gave it to Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, Hanho. Hold it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh? Thanks! Yeah, I can…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m lending it to you. You have to return it to this guy when I tell you to do so.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then Hanho’s eyes were full of disappointment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you kidding me? Why don’t you just give it to me as a man?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…You witnessed the wonderful synergy of , right? I can’t cut one of your arms for that, Hanho.”<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>When he said that, Hanho nodded quietly, and the synergy of the warrior was effective again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They resumed moving and climbed up the trail. The sunlight beaming through the trees and birds’ chirping suggested it was another peaceful day, but the constant screaming from the campus over the trees broke the peaceful mood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was still hell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How many are going to be killed?” Jisu asked with a frown.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo replied calmly, “Well, it depends on how well they can adapt.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like he said, the current situation was turbulent. Those who failed to adapt were killed, and their families perished.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If that’s the case, adapting is not that easy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I agree, but the first step to adaptation is very easy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What’s that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It is whether you admit it or deny it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Admit it or deny it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The moment you chose a card, confronted a goblin, and had to kill the goblin, most of you denied the situation and tried to run away, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What you mean is that you can fight only when you admit the situation is real. Then you can survive, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, that’s what I mean. Oh, we’re already here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In no time they arrived at the end of the trail. After they walked down the wooden stairs, they saw the main gate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Carefully look around you when you walk down the stairs.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, don’t you feel uneasy? Why are all the cars stopping in front of the gate?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>For some reason, lots of cars were blocked near the school gate. It looked as if they were trying to get out of there, but got stuck because they couldn’t leave.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon Sungwoo found out the reason.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>4<br/><br/>“Ah, again?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment when the clock switched to 08:00, the following message appeared before the eyes of all the survivors on campus.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“What the heck is this? Are they going to hunt us?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think so… Aside from a safe place, more warriors will be sent to larger groups? Does that mean only several warriors will come to us?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu nodded when Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They soon saw a group of orcs going down the hill behind campus. At a glance, there were about 18 of them. Roaring with a thunderous noise, they immediately ran to the school playground.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>And then chaotic screaming began sounding out from there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh? Isn’t that the place where the students staying with the student council members are?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my…if we had stayed there, we would have been in big trouble.”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Right now, did Sungwoo have to feel happy because he was far away from the student council members because of his feud with the president? Obviously, it was fortunate for him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taking the situation into account, it seemed that grouping together blindly for the purpose of the synergy effect was not always good. Instead of people moving around in groups, it was necessary to find the synergy that could bring about the best efficiency.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the Necromancer occupation was the best fit for the job.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>“Five orcs? Sungwoo, that’s less than the number of orcs that headed for the playground, but five orcs are rather…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungho believed that the orc they bumped into on the trail was rather tough because it had the title of patrol leader. Nonetheless, five orcs were really tough to deal with no matter how hard he thought about it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ve got an idea.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Really?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s set up a trap. Anyway, what they are sniffing out are humans like us, so they won’t notice it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungho planned to hunt the orcs instead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Five orcs were now approaching the main gate of the school. They smelled their prey here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sniff, sniff!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They found only four prey after sniffing hard. Since they were larger in number, the orcs let down their guard. By nature, they preferred intense fights, so they were less interested in this kind of small battle.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Wiggling their noses, the orcs waddled through the cars entangled with each other. As the path was narrow and they could not see well, they instinctively lifted their axes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the orc at the front felt something on its feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a bone. It looked like a goblin’s body, but it didn’t move. The orc had no way of knowing why it was there, but it didn’t care about it at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orc kept moving on. The bones of a goblin were also found on the ceiling of a car, but it didn’t care about that either because their prey suddenly appeared and provoked them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, we’re here! You quick-tempered pigs!” shouted Sungho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo? Did you just reveal our location?” Hanho said nervously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wait!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu were curled up in the driver’s seat and in the back respectively in a deserted car, with Hanho standing in front of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orcs roared, then walked toward Hanho with big strides.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of them laughed as if it already enjoyed watching them strangling their prey in the blind alley.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wait…” Sungwoo whispered, then tried to check the location of the skeletons with his eyes closed. The five skeletons were stationed at the narrow gaps among the cars here and there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After the orcs passed, the skeletons cautiously raised their bodies. Like dolls tied to a rope, they were strange and far from vibrant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho, keep provoking them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orcs’ sense of smell was so excellent that they could smell humans from a distance and chased after them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It suggested that their senses were extraordinary, so it was highly likely that they would notice even the little movement of the skeletons behind their back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That’s why Hanho had to divert their attention to him completely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tong! Tong! Tong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, come here! You damned…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While trembling with fear, he kept banging on the SUV with his sword. The orcs’ ears moved sensitively to that noise. Then they began to quicken their pace.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They ran between the cars and lifted their axes, pointing toward Hanho’s head. They narrowed the distance quickly with veins on the backs of their hands standing out visibly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo and Jisu who were stuck inside the car flung open the doors at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the perfect timing because an iron barricade suddenly came out before the charging orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter16">Chapter 16</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>After hitting the doors, they hesitated. They were not only blocked, but they were also taken aback by the impact. Suddenly, the five skeletons walked on the top of the SUV and charged toward the back of their heads right away. They leaped up, lifting the orc femur hammers, and hit them hard while jumping down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a thunderous thump, the giant orcs collapsed. They were not killed instantly, but the impact of their fall was big enough to make them unable to stand on their feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, the synergy of  was triggered at that moment. It could make the orcs ‘pass out’ with only a 5% chance, but fortunately, two of them fell helplessly.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“Now is the time!”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>At that moment Sungwoo, Jisu, and Hanho charged at them at the same time. They slaughtered the staggering orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whew…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I understand why the great victories in the history of the Korean people are great. That reminder hits the nail on the head…”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Like Hanho said, their operation was similar to the great victories that the Koreans dramatically achieved by overcoming their disadvantages. And there were always special rewards for great victories.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 43 gold by hunting an orc hunter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 24 gold by hunting an orc hunter.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>-You have earned 55 gold by hunting an orc hunter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 70 gold by hunting an orc hunter.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>-You have earned 40 gold by hunting an orc hunter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now it was clear that when hunting monsters through teamwork, differential rewards seemed to be issued, based on their contribution.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The first raid defense reward has been issued. (100 gold)<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 4)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the card selection window popped up in front of their eyes, and Sungwoo picked the ‘skill’ item again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Maximum number of subordinates has increased (+2).<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“Oh, what is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time it wasn’t one, but two. It was random, so if they’re lucky, can an explosive increase occur at once?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“A total of seven…but mana is the problem.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mana was still ’50’. Since skeletons are easily smashed, it’s important to resurrect new ones during battle. So, Sungwoo had to figure out how to increase his mana.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“Oh, I obtained a skill this time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that Hanho also leveled up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“High-speed···cutting? Only daggers can be applied here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Awesome.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…No, it’s not. Ah, I want to return.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu also stretched her fingers in the air. She said her muscle strength increased by only two points by choosing a definite stat because she was quite annoyed when she squatted while returning hits against the orc’s axe on the trail behind the mountain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I still feel like my muscles are strengthened since my body is getting hot.”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Then she brandished the sword back and forth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I definitely feel more empowered.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After that battle, Sungwoo found a goblin carcass nearby and resurrected it into a skeleton, so he came to lead a total of seven skeletons.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“Hanho, will you give the sword back to me?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Here you go.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I think you have to keep using the dagger to use your newly acquired skills.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“···”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo achieved the optimal synergy by having the five skeletons carry bone hammers and giving the one-armed skeleton the sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Based on his experiences so far, synergy was the key and variable of the battle, so the more synergy, the better.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo’s party began to check out the developments nearby while hiding in the trees and bushes outside the school. Then they witnessed a battle nearby. There was a shuttle bus stop a little up from the main gate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Only seven orcs are there. Well, they’re a minority compared to the crowds inside the school,” Jisu said, lying in the woods. Sungwoo was also crouching behind trees and watching the scene.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m afraid they’re going to be killed. At best only one man is wielding something through a window…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having heard that, Jisu raised her body and said, “Why don’t we help them?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Um.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu decided firmly to help them, but Sungwoo was a little hesitant. Nothing was as foolish as giving up safety for now.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“If we join hands with them and raid the orcs back and forth, we can easily kill them. Aren’t they easy prey for us?” asked Jisu, suggesting diversionary tactics to get them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was negative about it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But do you think people on campus can fight with us? If something goes wrong, we can end up fighting against each other. We can’t trust them in this situation, especially when they are terrified like that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu could not refute his statement. In this situation, uncertainty was the biggest threat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They needed another plan. And Sungwoo soon came up with a good idea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then let’s display a modern invention. I found a car key stuck in one of the trucks.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, do you like bumper cars? Or did you enjoy driving the  truck?”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Jisu was puzzled by his unexpected mention of a truck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, Sungwoo, I’m a master driver of GTA5.”<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>“Then, you drive.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…What?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho blinked his eyes at his unexpected offer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>…A little later, the orcs’ raids were still going on at the shuttle bus stop. There were five stuck inside the stop, but only two of them were carrying weapons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhh! Help me! Please help me!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t cry! Crying makes no difference!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh no! Fuck!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And they were all in a panicked state.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Puk! Puk! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The seven orcs holding the axes were chopping the door and wall of the stop randomly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, hit them. What the heck are you doing with that long spear?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What should I do when those bastards are not coming near the window? Why don’t you go out and fight them with your sword and shield?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Stop it, you asshole! We’re going to be killed like this!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no! I don’t want to die!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two men with weapons also had no courage to confront the orcs. It was a hopeless situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But then they saw something coming from far away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Eh? What is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they looked closely, a blue pickup truck was driving toward the stop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woowoong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sometimes driving backwards, it was driving toward them like crazy. Besides, there was a lot of white in the cargo compartment, shaking every time the car moved.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak— Squeak—<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the truck approached a little closer, they could identify that white object.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Skull?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Weren’t seven skeletons shaking and moving on the truck?<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“What the heck is that!”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>The truck drove toward the stop without hesitation, hitting the orcs banging the wall of the stop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A creepy noise was heard across the wall. Something rattling was heard right after the howling of the orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man holding the spear looked carefully over the window. At that moment the skeletons got off the truck in droves and began to smash the fallen orcs with clubs by the truck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? Kyongsu, what the hell is going on?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know. More scary bastards appeared…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the eyes of the man called Kyongsu, the skeletons looked like monsters, even more terrible monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fuck, why is this all happening at once?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Frightened, Kyongsu fell on the floor. A raid by the skeletons? He thought it was better when they were fighting against the orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A little later, the noise coming from outside disappeared and an unfamiliar silence reigned. Someone gulped. The students stuck at the stop realized that the invisible stillness was more dreadful.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are they gone?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But at that moment, there was a big noise.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump! Thump! Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The door shook roughly. Frightened, the students moved away from the door. It was like a scene from a horror movie.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh! Go away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shush! Be quiet!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Hey, guys? Didn’t you hear just somebody talking outside?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump! Thump! Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…We’re stuck inside. Open the door!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Indeed, human voices were heard outside the door. They raised their heads slightly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do skulls even speak?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s the devil… It’s bewitching us now!”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>At that moment, somebody’s head abruptly popped in through the smashed window.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please open the door! Please!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a man wearing a hooded poncho raincoat over his head. </div><h2 id="chapter17">Chapter 17</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“So, according to Kyongsu, you want to return the item to me?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>While asking that, Sungwoo looked back, frowning at the sudden loud noise.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho was beating a soft drink vending machine with an orc femur hammer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, what the heck are you doing dude?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I don’t have cash. Would you like a can of coke? Hahaha…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Step aside. I have some. Uh? What the heck…it’s out of order because you kicked it so hard!” Jisu exclaimed.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head and looked at Kyongsu again. There was still tension on his face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And Kyongsu’s eyes were now fixed on the terrible skeletons behind Sungwoo’s back.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>The bone weapons held by the small demons were densely covered with the blood of the orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, you don’t have to worry about them. In fact, they are cute… Oh no, please continue with what you were saying. That one over there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo raised his finger to point to the old analog TV set up in the corner of the bus stop building. It was a CRT-type model with its back protruding out. As far as Sungwoo knew, it was a broken item that was left unattended for a long time. But now there was light coming out from it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, you’re right. It gave me an item. Well, we’ve done it too, but we don’t have enough gold so we did it only once…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first glance, the five students seemed to have no experience fighting monsters. Sungwoo stood up from the chair and approached the monitor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s a store.” Hanho approached Sungwoo and gave him a coke. Sungwoo nodded, holding it. There was a hologram floating above the analog TV set. It was a green coin-shaped icon.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Chijijik―<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Welcome to the E-class shop!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a screen like a retro game machine. On the primary color interface, there was the message, “Press any key to proceed.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stretched his finger and pressed the (▲) button. Then the screen changed with cheerful music.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Choose your lucky roulette!<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Bronze (100)<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Silver (1,000)<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Gold (10,000)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* E-grade stores sell only ‘gold.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed like a system that could run a random roulette by consuming gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I wonder if we can get some items here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, even a sword fell from the air, so nothing is impossible.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Hanho asked, Jisu replied as if there was nothing else that could surprise them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo also no longer judged anything — he just based everything on common sense. It was good for the mind and body to believe that anything could happen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You can do it yourself to check it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I have 360 ​​gold. Bronze is perfect here….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I have 584 gold.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was no big difference in the number of gold that Jisu and Hanho possessed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What about you, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At Hanho’s question, he opened the status bar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Player profile]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Sungwoo Yu<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Level: 4<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Occupation: Necromancer<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Ability: Muscle Power (5), Agility (5), Physical Strength (5)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Gold Reserve: 1,552<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, I’ve got 1,552 gold…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Lol, then you can also run the silver roulette, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And one thing Sungwoo forgot also came up. His eyes looking at the monitor darted to one corner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-One roulette ticket is available (unlimited)<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Hm?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The roulette ticket was a reward that he obtained as a ‘hunting achievement’ after killing a goblin in the lobby on the first floor, but at that time he only remembered that he didn’t know how to use it. And right now an opportunity seemed to have come along for him to use it. So, he used the volume button to select ‘gold’ roulette.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, Sungwoo. That requires 10,000 gold.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ttididi-titit-ttiriri-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unlike Hanho’s concerns, the colorful roulette started playing cheerful 16-bit music. It seemed that the unlimited-grade ticket could be freely used for all grades.<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>The ratio of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place was printed in fine print on the roulette, and normal items, potion packages, and survival packages were written on the large part of the roulette.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Is it random again?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo pushed the button to turn the roulette. And the moment the 16-bit music reached the climax, he pressed the button once again. Then the music slowed down and the spinning of the roulette began to slow down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ttididi-di!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The music stopped and the roulette stopped too.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh! Jackpot!”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>But Sungwoo could not help but burst out laughing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Again, luck was the most necessary thing to have to survive.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The roulette stopped.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow… I’m not sure if you’re in first place, but you hit the jackpot, right? Moreover, you picked the gold roulette.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho muttered like that, then swallowed. It was really amazing to him as he had picked a one-star job from the beginning and received all kinds of ordinary items and skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sungwoo received a small box that fell from the air. Then he opened the box and picked up a blue gem in the shape of a water droplet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item Information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Sea Spirit Tears<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Orb<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Mana rise (+300), Mana recovery (+200%)<br/><br/>15<br/><br/>“You’re right. I’ve hit the jackpot!” Sungwoo nodded. This was what he needed because he didn’t have enough mana to maintain his skeletons. Thanks to the jackpot, the existing mana increased sixfold and increased mana recovery increased threefold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even the grade of the item is ‘Legend.’ Indeed, he must have hit the jackpot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, why don’t you spin the silver roulette with the current momentum?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why are you more excited than me?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, gambling is also fun as a bystander. I think that’s why people watch internet broadcasts about opening random item boxes.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Like Hanho suggested, Sungho invested 1,000 gold and spun the ‘silver’ roulette.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ttididi-titi-tiriri-<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, the roulette was spinning again with cheerful music, and when he pressed the button again, the roulette stopped.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the result was…<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Not bad!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, second place! Wow, you’re a goody-goody man!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time, he got the second prize. He instinctively stepped back, trying to receive something falling from the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something heavy fell on the floor. It was a large Tower Shield about one meter in size. It was often referred to as a square shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dang it, this item is going to kill me if I let down my guard…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item Information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Vanguard’s Shield<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>-Grade: Rare<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Shield<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Additional defense power for 10 minutes at the start of battle (+20%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he lifted the item, it didn’t weigh more than he thought, perhaps because of its good balance. He didn’t know what the material was. Obviously, this was far from normal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Hanho and Jisu also spun the roulette. As a result, Hanho received the ‘C-grade potions package,’ and Jisu received a rare second-class weapon, “Punitive Expedition Longsword.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Only I don’t have one…” Hanho murmured dejectedly, complaining he had no luck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nevertheless, his item was quite useful. To be precise, it seemed practical.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item Information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Small Health Recovery Potions<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Class C<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Potions<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Quick recovery.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He received two of these, which contained two mana recovery potions, and two antidotes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho, who knows that the item you picked a moment ago would increase your life? Look on the bright side, man.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, let me just draw the shield. I don’t want to get shot from the beginning.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t whine like a child.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The drawing was over. Sungwoo decided to save the remaining gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho got a bag from one of the students at the bus stop and put the potions in it. Jisu ground a sword with the ‘Ignition Whetstone’ she had obtained by killing the boss monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I want to use two swords because I have to be careful when dealing with fire.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then she hung the two swords on her back. With two swords in a red sweatsuit, she looked like a gladiator, which reminded Sungwoo of a scene from .<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kyongsu’s party was strangely looking at Sungwoo and his friends’ activities from a little while ago. It was hard to keep calm in this crazy situation, but they seemed to be ready for the next battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, he asked, “Well, don’t you understand the current situation? How can you stay so calm?”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Jisu replied, “Well, we’re trying to adjust to it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Really?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, there is no other way,” she said while looking at Sungwoo, because she repeated what he had said to her before. </div><h2 id="chapter18">Chapter 18</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            1<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Like Sungwoo said, trying to understand the situation only meant evading and culling. In the real world, there is no other way than to adapt to it. And she totally agreed with that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, the playground is still in a chaotic situation…” she said, looking out the door.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shouts and screams were still ringing from the playground about 200 meters away from them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The fight was still going on, even after quite a long time passed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can the guys from the student council win? Shouldn’t we go and help them this time?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Um.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was not happy about the arrogance of the student council members, but he didn’t want them to be killed for that reason.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>And now he realized that his fighting would not only save them but also give him a good chance to make it an easy game. He had already enjoyed the big gains by attacking the rear of the orcs that were caught off guard.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Then let’s act carefully this time too.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo reached out to the orc’s body lying like a lump near the stop. Then, its flesh and intestines turned into ashes and disappeared, leaving only bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kyungsoo’s party was just astonished to see what happened before their eyes. But they should not be surprised yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon the bone pieces were reassembled into weapons. With their jaws dropping, they looked at Sungwoo’s party.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I think I know why you want to fight… Is it like a superpower?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s not that, well, I’m just like you, Kyongsu.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Well, I don’t think so.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Instead of replying, Sungwoo kept working on the bones. Now, the mana also grew, so he made dozens of weapons using the bone weapon manufacturing bone skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the weapons were all daggers. More specifically, they were made for throwing purposes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho, come on, take as many as you want.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow. I am full of miscellaneous blessings. Without this situation, I guess I would have to open up a junk shop.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you belittling a junk shop now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? Oh, if you take it like that, let me take back what I said.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho and the skeletons picked up the bone daggers. It was verified several times that throwing a dagger did not mean landing a fatal blow, but it could create a decisive chance for Sungho’s party to attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, are we going to display modern convenience again?” Hanho said while pointing at the truck. But he shook his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This time, let’s drive a bigger vehicle.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>He turned and looked at the shuttle bus parked on one side of the stop.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t a missed soccer ball that hit the soccer goal post. It was a throwing axe that missed the target.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man who dodged the axe was running like crazy, screaming. A huge orc was following him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The green playground was stained with blood. Looking at it from a distance, it looked like a festival, but actually it was the scene of slaughter. Humans running away and monsters hot on their trail… After all, they were caught up with the monsters’ axes stabbed into the back of their heads…<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of survivors and dozens of orcs were entangled in the fight, creating a scene that was too horrible to watch.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Brother, Ahh!”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Among them was a frightened Jisok who lifted his shield. Right after that, something hit the middle of the shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh!” He stepped back awkwardly, groaning. His arms were tingling. It was not because the orc hit him with the axe — the orc barely poked him. Nonetheless, his arms almost felt numb.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is crazy…” He thought deep down, ‘Now we’re dead. We’re all going to die here. We can do nothing.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Daesung, who identified himself as the president of the student council and a Level 3, stabbed a bayonet into an orc’s chest. He was doing his best to fight back against the orc, but that was it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come on guys, get together! Make a way for an escape!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although he declared that he would protect the students, he was now trying to find a way to run away when the situation was so tough to overcome.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Daesung, lots of students are isolated in the stands!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ignore them! Are you crazy enough to care about them? We have to find a way to get out of the playground right now! Jinsok! Hyungmin! You guys stand at the forefront because you have the shields.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They had no power to overcome the current situation. They were preoccupied with saving their own lives, which was not that easy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, something huge rushed into the playground with the big sound of the horn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Shuttle bus?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the school shuttle bus. It was driving into the playground with its large wheels trampling upon the artificial turf.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the bus ran over a huge orc. However, it didn’t stop there. Like a wild African elephant, it was driving around and chasing and trampling on the orcs ruthlessly.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>“Uh, what the heck…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The student union members, standing in the way of the bus’s moving direction, stepped aside, frightened, and looked at the skeletons sticking out their heads through the windows of the passing shuttle bus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Huh? That’s…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And at that moment, the skeletons threw something towards the orcs all at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Swoosh! Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were daggers. The moment the bus passed, they hurled daggers randomly at the orcs. The orcs also counter-attacked by throwing axes, but they were blocked by the body of the bus.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahh! Fuck! I was almost struck on the forehead with an axe!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sometimes their axes pierced through the windows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, you son of a bitch, eat my dagger!… Uh? They’re really eating it? Don’t lie down right after eating, you asshole!”<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>Hanho’s dagger-throwing skills were improving day by day.<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kyongsu was driving the shuttle bus. In fact, his job was a heavy-duty truck driver in the army.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he was holding a spear, Kyongsu could hardly perform, but as he grabbed the steering wheel, he picked only the orcs with his adroit driving skills and began running over them.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Whenever he did it, a message about gold appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! Gold is coming in!”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“Let’s stop the bus here. Let’s go, Jisu.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah. I’m ready.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The bus stopped in the middle of the playground. At the same time, the front door opened, and Sungwoo and Jisu got off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle, rattle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon the skeletons leaped simultaneously from both sides of the window. They scattered widely and began to aim their daggers at the orcs. They looked like well-trained commandos.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everybody, get on the bus! Come on!” Sungwoo shouted. He stood at the entrance of the bus, holding the Tower Shield. Then, the survivors, who had been paying attention to the shuttle bus when it first came running in droves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? That man is…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, I should have followed him…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those who witnessed Sungwoo’s brilliant fighting at the Humanities and Social Sciences building belatedly regretted not following him. However, they thought it was so fortunate to meet him even now, and ran to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orcs chased them from behind, but they fell to a shower of flying daggers, or they had to hesitate to move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You can’t pass me!”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Now Sungwoo and Jisu were much stronger than before. In particular, Jisu was burning with the desire to fight the orcs even by choosing ‘Muscle Strengthening’ as ​​a level-up card. Actually she was notorious for her strong desire to win in the sports world.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Facing an orc bigger than herself, she boldly walked up to the giant animal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I won’t lose easily this time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She took out the sword whose blade she had sharpened with the ‘Ignition Whetstone.’ The moment she corrected her posture, the orcs charged at her with their axes. It was a blow that fell from as high as three meters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a big clang, which was similar to the previous one. Her body shook a lot at that moment. The terrible impact struck her elbow, shoulder, back, spine, and thigh one by one, but she did not collapse like before. Instead, she stuck it out, clenching her teeth tightly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the moment the axe and the sword clashed, a spark flew off the blade of her sword.<br/><br/>2 </div><h2 id="chapter19">Chapter 19</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            2<br/><br/> <br/><br/>As if it didn’t expect it at all, the orc flinched and closed its eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now is the time!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu instantly stepped forward, sliding the sword down the axe and cut its neck on the spot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cough, cough…<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orc missed the axe and grabbed the nape of its. Then it dropped to its knees.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Success!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment she cut the orc’s throat, she felt a great thrill of joy because she thought she had overcome a big obstacle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, when she turned her head and watched Sungwoo fighting, she had to admit that she was still lacking in various skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle, rattle—<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo seemed to have fully learned how to easily defeat the orcs while fighting with them in the last few battles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The seven skeletons never approached the orcs. Sungwoo knew that in a close battle he had to use skeletons, which caused a loss of his battle resources. On the other hand, the battle was advantageous if the skeletons did not get close to the orcs.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>‘Sungwoo’s tactic is efficiency itself,’ she thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The skeletons surrounded an orc that approached them, then moved endlessly and threw daggers with both hands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>If the orc approached, the targeted skeleton retreated, then at the same time the other skeletons kept it at bay instantly, so it couldn’t even counterattack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It took about 20 seconds to smash an orc to pieces.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly thereafter, some of them swiftly recovered the daggers, while others again surrounded another orc and beat it ruthlessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And they were all attacking based on Commander Sungwoo’s calculations. Watching him mounting a calculated attack, Jisu once again felt a sense of deprivation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘He’s calculating everything. He is not killing them with an overwhelming force, but with shrewd calculation.”‘<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>She suddenly felt she was foolish because she only invested in her muscle strength after she was overpowered by an orc in the recent battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She could feel from Sungwoo today that strength was not everything, but rather it was the process of making the most of one’s strength and applying it to the opponent’s weakness. And she realized that the reason she ended up being a second-rate sportsman was not that she was physically weak.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>‘What did he do in the past?” Jisu asked herself, admiring his great fighting skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While she was admiring him, most of the survivors boarded the bus. Sungwoo took the skeletons and slaughtered the other orcs nearby.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 70 gold by hunting the orc hunter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 70 gold by hunting the orc hunter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 70 gold by hunting the orc hunter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo’s party got rid of the orcs around the playground, a group of the student council members began to approach them. Obviously, they got shit-faced, embarrassed by Sungwoo and his friends’ brilliant victory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ooops! Why did you come out? Didn’t you tell me you hated staying with these awful skeletons?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Daesung’s face hardened when Sungwoo teased him slyly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Why are you so mean right now? Aren’t you so cold-hearted?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I wouldn’t do it without this kind of situation.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo said with a bright smile, “I’m sorry, but I think you have to leave that terrible bayonet behind to get on the bus. What if someone gets stabbed in this narrow bus?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What did you say? Like you said, I need a weapon to defend myself, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well? I think I can protect you. You will feel safer with our cute skeletons rather than such a clumsy and blunt sword.”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Sungwoo did not hesitate to pay back disgusting guys with disgusting punishment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anger was evident in Daesung’s eyes. Sungwoo could feel that he wanted to lift the bayonet right away and crush the skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Roar!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, there was an unidentified roar from the far side of the gym. Those who heard the roaring felt their knees instinctively knock together, like a rabbit hearing a predator crying.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The orc clan chief is furious because of the failed hunt.<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>What the heck is this? Sungwoo also shuddered with fear, but he pretended to be as calm as possible, “Aren’t you going to get on the bus? Then we’re leaving now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tong-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eventually, Daesung put down the bayonet. Sungwoo smiled at him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, take off that chain armor, too.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? My armor is not dangerous, is it?” Daesung said, grinding his teeth with anger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You have to pay for my protection. I’m not a student council member like you who’s devoted to the students.”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>In Daesung’s eyes, Sungwoo’s action looked cruel, but that was how he had to get adjusted to the new environment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was adapting himself to the new situation faster than anyone else.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In respect to this crazy situation, Necromancer and the battle, he accumulated data and made appropriate judgments. And his experience paid off nicely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 5)<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>He reached Level 5 thanks to the just-ended battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And one message line followed…<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You can summon a mid-sized monster as your subordinate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, he finally could lay his hands on the orcs. If so, he didn’t need to hurl daggers dagger from a distance for fear of being out-muscled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, this was not the end of the story. Sungwoo, who sat down at the front of the bus, was agonized about the selection of a level-up card.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Choose a level-up card.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Stat (Random)<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Skill (Random)<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Item (Random)<br/><br/><br/><br/>4) Other (Random)<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>5) The maximum number of subordinates +1 (Confirmed)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Again, it was composed of 4 random items and 1 confirmed item.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He had consistently chosen ‘skill’ until now to increase his subordinates as much as possible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On one hand, he was not sure if it was right to rely on them alone when he did not know what would come out the stats, items, etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I have no choice but to choose it if I don’t want to fight myself.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, Sungwoo selected number 2.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The maximum number of subordinates has increased (+2).<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“Good. Now I’ve got nine skeletons.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His selection was the most acceptable and most efficient outcome. Although the skill of  may be more valuable, he thought it was better to increase the number of subordinates for now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then Sungwoo put the chain armor on the one-armed skeleton, which he took from Daesung as the price of his protection.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crackle<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hmm, is it too long?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As this guy was the most reliable skeleton in many ways, he decided that he would not spare his investment. He even gave it a new name.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Since the name ‘one-armed’ seemed to be without any emotional attachment, he renamed it ‘Right’ because it had only a right arm.<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>Rattle—<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right guy waddled along in an armored suit, but the end of the chain almost reached its ankle, so it could not move freely. In this condition, its flexibility and maneuverability, which were the goblin’s greatest strengths, were completely unworkable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You can’t wear it. Take it off.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eventually, Sungwoo decided to wear it himself. He questioned whether this chain armor could help him block the orc’s battle axe, but it was better than nothing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, survivors over there!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho pointed out the window of the bus, making a big fuss. The survivors covered all over with their wounds were facing three goblins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt that he wasn’t even nervous about the goblins now.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The bus was slowly navigating the roads inside the campus to rescue some straggling survivors. In fact, it actually picked up about twenty students.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I think we need another bus.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, I don’t think so. We’re not going to keep driving the bus anyway,” Sungwoo replied.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, those who gathered there as survivors totaled about sixty, and thirty of them were armed with good weapons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nevertheless, he felt the number of survivors was so small. Is it because today was Friday when there weren’t that many classes? Or is it because many of them were killed? The campus was so quiet that it felt creepy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, anyway, we survivors should unite to confront the orcs. Running away is not the answer,” Sungwoo said, standing at the front of the bus.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Was it because they responded to the raid by the orc hunters nicely? </div><h2 id="chapter20">Chapter 20</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The contents of the quest changed a moment ago, but his message was not that they should be prepared for the orcs’ small-scale raid.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The chief orc decided to wage a ‘full-scale war.’ The orcs would pursue survivors with the goal of exterminating them.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>It seemed that the level of difficulty increased.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyway, the fact that they could get out of the school only when they killed the boss monster hasn’t changed. They had to inevitably face the kingdom’s army to kill the king.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There is no way to avoid them. We have to kill their boss to get out of this school.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But soon they got desperate news.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, hey, I saw them while I was in the gym. There were a lot there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to his testimony, the number of orcs seemed to be about one hundred.<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>Of course, since dozens of orc hunters had been hunted by them, their number seemed to have been reduced somewhat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nonetheless, it was unreasonable to fight the orcs in a full-scale war. Even if there were as many students as the orcs, their routine daily lives were no match for the monsters that enjoyed fighting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Inverse penalty effect’ has been triggered due to incomplete team play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Penalty List]<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Poor members<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Intrinsic penalty<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: More than 10 people under Level 5<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Side effects: Movement speed reduction (-30%), attack power reduction (-5%)<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>2) Helpless newcomers<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Intrinsic penalty<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: 10 or more with no record of killing monsters<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Side effects: attack power reduction (-10%), gold accumulation reduction (-10%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Desperate Morale (2nd stage)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Intrinsic penalty<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: Absolute majority unwilling to fight<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>-Side effects: Probability of ‘chaotic state’ increase (+10%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Disorderly crowds seemed to exist for this kind of situation. It wasn’t always good for them to unite because it would make their movements inefficient.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It’s clear now. Just holding weapons is not always helpful. Rather, there’s just a lot to worry about.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought he should be a little prudent. He needed to join hands with people, not save people. But what if he could not find them…<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I will fight alone.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Pardon? Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, are you crazy? What the heck are you talking about?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo answered the question with certainty, “I’m going to fight the orcs alone.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not only his friends but also people inside the bus showed pessimistic responses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What did you say? Did I hear wrong?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Even if you’re the genius fighter, you can’t…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Isn’t that person crazy? Well, you know what? If you are treated as a hero, it gets into your head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dang it! I really can’t trust anyone.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The student council members including Daesung and Jinsok also began to ridicule and scorn him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You crazy asshole, I knew you were going to dig your own grave.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jinsok, I think that asshole was really lucky. I think I would feel great if he were killed in the fight.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Yes, brother, you’re right. He is such a pathetic jerk. Maybe his days are numbered.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo didn’t give in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please stay in a safe place. Let me kill the orcs and help you get out of campus.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As she could not stand it anymore, Jisu stood up and held his arm.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, what are you talking about? There aren’t just one or two orcs. Even if we fight together, it’s going to be tough…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, you remember what you said on the first floor when you climbed up the rooftop to hunt the boss monster?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You said that even if we took them to the fight, they would be useless. You said they were worse than skeletons.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, I remember, but…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You saw their colors correctly. Oh, you are helpful, Jisu. But this time, it seems to be a little dangerous for you. And I’ve made the decision after some hard thinking and calculation.”<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>In Jisu’s opinion, Sungwoo clearly fought based on the thorough calculation of gains and losses. In other words, he devised proper fighting tactics to win safely and efficiently without any waste or damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘But this is different,’ Jisu thought to herself.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>She thought it would be an impossible fight this time because no one would think that fewer than ten skeletons could beat over a hundred orcs. No, it was impossible even to imagine.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo stubbornly went ahead with his plan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The survivors fled into a nearby building. Then, they watched the playground through the window where Sungwoo was waiting for the orc’s army.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nonsense. Is he really going to do it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Doesn’t he have any secret tactics?”<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>All kinds of bodies were already scattered all over the playground. Orcs, goblins, and people… The blood around their bodies showed that some terrible things took place there. But the survivors only focused on what was going to happen because the eccentric guy Sungwoo was standing at center stage doing crazy things now.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Woooong—<br/><br/><br/><br/>A shuttle bus came near the playground. Jisoo, Hanho, and Kyongsu were in it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He is really crazy…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If we feel like something’s off, we can drive there right away and pick him up.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whew! I am ready to step on the accelerator too.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even they thought Sungwoo would fail this time. Although he showed extraordinary fighting skills until now, this fight was too much for him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was trembling with fear too. His heart was pounding hard, and cold sweat broke out on his back. He caught his breath and looked in the direction of the gym.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whew! I’m sure I’m going to win this fight as I planned.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly he saw a bunch of orcs coming out of the gym.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They must be the main unit.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were no ranks or order in the troops that were mobilized for an all-out war. However, he got the feeling that they were tough. They were literally ‘savage warriors.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The red-haired orc at the forefront screamed. At the same time, over a hundred orcs were roaring so loudly as if they were shaking the school building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh, so noisy. Is that guy the chief orc?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, it looked like a middle-level boss, given there was no message about the chief’s appearance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon the orc turned its head toward Sungwoo. Then it lifted the axe and pointed to him. Now all the orcs fixed their eyes on him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orcs moved toward him. They were moving slowly and leisurely, but he knew that at a certain moment, they would charge toward him like a herd of cows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, let’s move.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo moved to another place. He climbed the stairs to the highest point of the stands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s stick it out here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tall iron railings lined both sides of the stairs, which in some respects seemed like a small canyon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It is advantageous to confront them in a narrow place. It’s less disadvantageous.’<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>The orcs were many times the size of Sungwoo’s party. Confronting them on open terrain was like suicide, so it was necessary to cause their confusion by attracting them to a narrow place. That was why he was standing in the middle of the playground. Then he came up late to lead the orcs to move here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo resurrected two skeletons from the goblin bodies strewn nearby.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Rattle—<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, he had a total of nine goblins standing at the forefront. The orcs slowly narrowed the distance, watching his actions. There was nothing suspicious about their actions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whew, hey, guys, it was fun having you. Even if you turn into ashes, don’t forget me,” he said to the skeletons.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>In no time the orcs entered the playground. At first glance, there seemed to be about 30 to 40.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he came face to face with the rugged and giant monsters coming in with big axes…<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fuck you…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp—<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were approaching Sungwoo’s party.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, there was a way for him to choose with confidence. And he still believed it was possible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Because the steps are narrow, only about three orcs can climb at one time.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, when the orcs stepped on the first staircase, he raised his hand and triggered ‘Madness of Wilderness’ on his wrist.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woowooing—<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Madness of the Wilderness has been triggered!<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Attack power targeting ‘goblin-type’ mercenaries has increased (+10%), attack speed increased (+20%) for 10 minutes.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Crackle! Crackle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The red eyes of the nine skeletons glared all at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaa! </div><h2 id="chapter21">Chapter 21</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>At that moment, the orcs also began to roar. When they looked at a bunch of fist-sized goblin bones, one of them even laughed scornfully as if the skeletons were ridiculous. But the orc was killed on the spot, smiling. The dagger was stuck in its neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The goblin skeletons in the higher place threw daggers with both hands very speedily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With 18 daggers flying toward them per second, the orcs couldn’t stand it no matter how tough they were.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Three orcs climbing at the forefront rolled down the stairs. However, those in the rear started to strike the daggers by lifting the axes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang! Clang! Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, their surprise dagger attack ended there. However, they were ready to mount a subsequent attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Run!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo issued an order, eight goblins jumped while holding their Orc Femur Hammers. Then, falling toward the orcs’ heads, they hit them with the hammers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, their attack was like a suicide attack, or in other words, that of the undead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, their attack was not that efficient. Jumping from high ground and hitting their heads instantly was obviously powerful, but as they were completely exposed to the orcs’ counterattack, they were beaten quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crackle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You wait!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, there was only one goblin skeleton left, namely Right. Sungwoo saved it on purpose for a decisive fight. It always helped Sungwoo win the fight at a decisive moment.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>The orcs shook the bone dust off their bodies and began climbing the stands one by one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hhhhhhhhaaaaa—<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orcs were convinced of their win. They seemed to think the fight was already over because there were only two enemies left in front of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But at that moment, the head of the orc standing at the forefront was broken in half, with blood gushing like a fountain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orcs looked back at the surprise attack. And they soon saw a huge skull standing up with its skin peeling off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The red light glaring from its empty eyes… That was their last memory because their heads were cut off and bounced into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Among the horde of orcs, eight ‘orc skeletons’ were resurrected. Then, they began to ruthlessly swing the battle axes toward their living fellow orcs. Besides, the way they wielded the axes was far from ordinary.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>-‘Synergy’ is given due to your team play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Savage Warrior (Phase 1)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Weapon Synergy<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: 5 or more axes<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Attack power increase (15%), attack speed increase (+15%) for 10 seconds with the start of combat *Standby time 10 minutes<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orcs were embarrassed by the attack by the corpses of their fellows, which were resurrected right among themselves. Five orcs fell instantly. Since the stairs were so narrow, they could hardly counterattack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon several of them woke up to the situation and fought back, which led to a bloody battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But there was one obvious difference… The orcs that were engaged in wielding axes fell, shedding blood, but the skeletons only had their bones broken or their skulls fractured.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Yes, although they were vulnerable to a single blow strong enough to break the foundation of their bodies, they could hold out much longer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first glance, the orcs’ bones were different from those of goblins, which looked like the frame of a well-built building. In other words, they could resist a single blow with an axe easily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Indeed, even if they broke a skeleton, the body of a nearby dead colleague would have its skin peeled off, and then it was reborn as a new skeleton. Then it would lift its axe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was literally an undead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, this is it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Come to think of it, a Necromancer was something like this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, dozens of students were sneaking out the window through the curtains.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They watched the battle on the playground with uneasiness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But everything ended in an instant. As soon as eight goblin skeletons launched a near-suicide attack, they disappeared like melting snow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it, it’s over…” someone murmured in a low voice. A sigh of despair broke out among them here and there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although they expected such an outcome, they were just aghast at the dark situation unfolding before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It was impossible from the beginning.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>And now that even Sungwoo was killed, they saw no hope at all. Heavy despair dominated the lecture hall where they were stuck. They thought it was their turn now. They thought the orcs would open the door and slaughter them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, somebody shouted, “Uh, what the heck is that? Look over there!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What, what? What is going on?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They noticed something and became disturbed. To their surprise, the orcs started fighting among themselves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wait a minute, they are skeletons, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They soon found white giants among the orcs, the very white devils mercilessly wielding axes toward their fellow orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Aren’t they bones?”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“What the heck is that man…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Yea, what is his real identity?”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kyongsu, sitting in the driver’s seat of the shuttle bus, put his foot down on the accelerator pedal almost halfway, but he then released it. When Sungwoo climbed up the stands, Kyongsu thought that it was impossible to rescue him, but he saw the orcs in the middle of their ranks breaking away from them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tables were turned in his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, it seems that Sungwoo invested some skills. He should have tipped me off,” said Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, he launched the attack with a careful calculation,” said Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She watched the fighting scene, gaping at Sungwoo and the skeletons. Everyone stared at the scene blankly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And Sungwoo was looking at the mana bar before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Mana (184/350)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It is not insufficient anymore, Actually, I’ve got a surplus.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Is this the power of one item? Because the ‘Sea Spirit Tears’ is a Legend-grade item, he could keenly experience the huge effects.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He had already resurrected 16 skeletons, but he still had enough mana left. Moreover, he even recovered 14 mana. He felt as if he had a spring in his body that never dried up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, a message appeared, noting that his victory was around the corner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The herd of orcs is weakened by the ‘Smell of Death’ (stage 1)! Stat drop: 30%!<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>*4 or more skeletons of the same clan have been resurrected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>– With the reflection of the herd of orcs’ fighting spirit, stats have been reduced by half.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if it was due to the peculiar nature of the orcs, the curse was not fully reflected, but the 15% decline in stat was a big penalty not to be taken lightly. Besides, the orcs could exercise overwhelming power thanks to the synergy of the <br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t just the power. Their resilient vitality was fear itself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While fighting entangled with each other, two or three orcs wielded axes from all directions after surrounding one orc skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They cut its arm, smashed its ribs, and cut its femur in half.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But when they smashed the orc skeleton…<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were sacrificed by the new skeleton that attacked them from the back. The battle was the continuation of that process. The orcs attacked Sungwoo’s party with the overwhelming numerical advantage at first, but as the fight continued, the number of orcs began to decrease rapidly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though they were so skillful in fighting and enjoyed fighting, the orc combat unit had never experienced this kind of fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuh…<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sungwoo assigned a new mission to Right. He had Right use its small body to sneak over the railing and attack them from behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And this tactic was very efficient.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right charged toward the orcs, cutting their knees one after another. Because of its ambush, the orcs in the rear collapsed all at once. That little guy gave the giant orcs a fatal blow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the support from the rear collapsed like that, the morale of the orcs in the front was completely broken. Soon, the number of dead bodies was higher than the number of living orcs. In fact, the fighting was virtually over at that moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s end the battle.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Realizing that there was no more hope, about ten surviving orcs gave up the battle and fled to the gym. </div><h2 id="chapter22">Chapter 22</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The short and intense battle was finally over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whew!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Letting out a hot breath, Sungwoo sat down on the stairs. As if it were the reward for that intense battle, a welcome message appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-A ‘roulette ticket’ has been issued for killing 100 monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* As the 21st achiever in history, you have been upgraded to the “Unlimited” level. (100 people only)<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>‘It’s a bonus limited to 100 people, which I received when I killed 20 monsters.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time he examined the bonus a little more carefully.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The 21st achiever in history? Is this the record as of now, by the world standard?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If that’s the case, it means there are 20 more people in the world that have slaughtered as many monsters as I did. Did they also pick a good job at first? Are there any cards with 5 stars or more? How good is a Necromancer among them?’<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>Woowoong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, a school bus passed by on the school road at a huge speed. At first, he thought Hanho and Jisu were on it, but that bus was standing far away in its original parking spot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Huh? What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Was anybody trying to escape now? There were still a lot of survivors hiding inside the school. However, since the seal on the gate had not been broken yet, it would be impossible to try to escape now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo continued to look at the status of the speeding bus. The bus succeeded in forcibly pushing out the cars that blocked the entrance, but it could never pass through the gate blocked by the purple chain icon. However, when the people on the bus got off, somebody’s familiar outfit caught his eye.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“···Ah? Is it that damn bastard?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was none other than Daesung Park, the president of the student council.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that he planned to escape from behind Sungwoo’s back and run away by driving a bus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I told him not to do it multiple times. How could he ignore my warning?”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Stupidly enough, Daesung seemed not to have taken Sungwoo’s warning seriously that he could not get out of the gate unless they killed the boss monster first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And he had to pay for his recklessness dearly. It just so happened that the gym was located near the gate, and the orcs in the gym began to approach the bus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What happened after that was beyond Sungwoo’s control. Although Daesung resisted by wielding the bayonet, he could not confront a dozen orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Tut, tut…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the orcs caught him alive instead of killing him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A scream rang from far away. Orcs were breaking his arms. After crippling his arms and legs, they grabbed his head and dragged him to the gym.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu was right. He’s more worthless than a skull.”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Sungwoo clicked his tongue.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo now launched the attack on the gym. This time, he was not alone. Hanho, Jisu and Kyongsu’s party, as well as some of Sungwoo’s followers, joined him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We will fight too!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“At least I won’t disturb you.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“I can protect myself!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In total, 21 people came to support Sungwoo, but he was not happy because he keenly felt like it was much more comfortable to fight alone.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“All I want you to do is not stand in the way of skeletons’ movement.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, this time, he thought that he needed someone vigilant in the back because he had to enter the boss monster’s room where anything could happen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since it was not an open space, he needed to defend as much as possible to get into the enemy’s den.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Sungwoo and the others headed for the gym to kill the last boss monster in the school.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Screech—<br/><br/><br/><br/>The door made of soundproof material was opened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On both sides of the entrance, there was a rag-like leather insignia hanging on a movable basketball hoop stand with a tusk-covered oak pattern. Then, a stage with a bizarrely decorated facade caught his eye.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The interior here really sucks!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ropes were tied at regular intervals to the stage ceiling and the light frames. With the necks of the bodies tied around it, the ropes swung back and forth.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Directly beneath ropes, in the midst of the pattern drawn with blood, a red-haired orc was sitting cross-legged.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What the heck is it doing? Meditating?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, people began to be dragged out from behind the stage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhh! Help me!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were a group of people including Daesung. Both of his arms were hanging loose, completely broken.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party approached without any interruption and stopped about twenty steps away from the stage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, please mind your surroundings.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At his reminder, she carefully looked around. Since both sides were in the stands, Sungwoo didn’t know where and when the orcs would launch an ambush. However, he could not find any special movement on their part yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t see them there…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Right. It’s completely empty.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was too strange. All he could see was about twenty orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘No way…are they going to take them hostage as their last resort?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that those stupid orcs would try it, but he could not think of any other thing at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As he walked one step closer, the orcs knelt on the hostages. Then they picked up their axes from behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stopped again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh! Help! Please save us!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The hostages shouted in panic. Jinsok was crying with his head down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo sighed, looking at him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come on, Sungwoo!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Daesung called him, his voice trembling with urgency.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please save us! Sungwoo, can you do it? Yeah? please!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at him and the boss orc alternately. The boss orc was murmuring something while sitting cross-legged, with black smoke rising from his hands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At a glance, its action was suspicious.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come on, Sungwoo!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shut up!” shouted Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Daesung stiffened, with his mouth open wide.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You’re so stupid, but the biggest problem is that you are greedy about your title without knowing that you’re stupid. You’ve put other people at risk like this.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You messed up everything by doing whatever you wanted, and you got what you wanted, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m sorry, but you can’t do it anymore here. Well, I don’t have to say sorry.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Coldly and realistically, Sungwoo now started to attack the orcs, followed by the skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Daesung’s head was cut by the orc’s axe and rolled down. Sungwoo did not feel guilty because he brought it on himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Geh?”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>But right after that, the orcs put the axes on their necks and cut them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What? Were they suddenly committing suicide? Red blood gushed from their necks, and their heavy bodies collapsed all of a sudden.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“Ugh? What the heck are they doing?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And finally, the boss orc, sitting cross-legged, opened its eyes. Its yellow pupils faced Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Strengthened boss monster ‘Lesser Black Conjuror Orc Chief’ has appeared.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>At that moment, black smoke came out of its body. Without any time to escape, unknown smoke quickly filled the gym.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh! Cough! Cough!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh! What the heck is this? It’s strange!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I suddenly feel so weak… Ugh.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And people who inhaled the smoke began to fall one by one. The only thing that was visible in their blurry sight was a warning message.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You are sliding into a state of ‘confusion’ by the Breath of the Abyss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You are sliding into a state of ‘powerlessness’ by the Breath of the Abyss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You are sliding into a state of ‘stiffness’ by the Breath of the Abyss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your mana is constantly burning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh….” Hanho opened his bag and hurriedly took out a potion. It was a ‘C-class antidote,’ an item from the potions package. To the best of his memory of the item description, the potions could rescue him from this kind of ‘abnormal condition.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gulp- Gulp-<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuuuuh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho felt the symptoms of paralysis quickly disappearing. He hurriedly took out another bottle to give to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo! Where are you? Take this quickly…Ugh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He finally found Sungwoo, but he felt something strange.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Take care of Jisu, please.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, what about you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not affected at all by the smoke, Sungwoo was walking forward with a pleasant smile on his face.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“What the heck…” </div><h2 id="chapter23">Chapter 23</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Soon the smoke gradually faded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He saw a giant animal about 20 to 30cm standing on the stage. It was looking down the stage while holding a huge mace. Down there, twenty people had collapsed onto the floor. And only three people were still standing. Hanho and Jisu emerged from the smoke thanks to the potions.<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>“Whew! Why am I so refreshed? Hahaha!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt a bit strange. After he inhaled the smoke, he felt enormous pleasure beyond description, so much so that he smiled in satisfaction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Mana has been greatly increased by the Breath of the Abyss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Mana (4,585/4,585)<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>“Is my mana over 4,000? Now I know why it feels so pleasant. Hahaha…”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>-Breath of the Abyss has accumulated in the body and you have temporarily been exposed to the ‘1st stimulant.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>-All stats have been significantly increased.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>-The maximum number of subordinates has temporarily increased (+50).<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was clear as to why he was full of stamina.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I just don’t know what you’ve done for me, but I want to know the secret behind this.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo found himself to be immensely strong.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he, who was perfectly fine, walked toward it confidently, the boss orc’s face hardened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It looks like the boss never expected it at all?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, is this why the boss took his time to sacrifice all its subordinates? Operation Poison Gas?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The sacrifices were needed to prepare mysterious witchcraft and quite a long spell cast time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They began to understand their puzzle over the boss orc’s suspicious actions. To say the least, the boss orc made numerous sacrifices for a devastating blow, but it had made a big mistake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Perhaps the five-star Necromancer card selected by Sungwoo was a joker because it served as a decisive blow at the decisive moment for him.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Hanho and Jisu stood on his sides.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“Well, it seems like a repetition of our fight on the rooftop. Oops…I’ve got heartburn…I feel like I had too much alcohol, then a hangover drink.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I am also ready to fight.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo shook his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, it’s going to be a little different from our fight at the rooftop.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo’s eyes glowed red. Although it was a temporary 1st stimulant, it seemed to prove that he was clearly changed.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The same message kept popping up before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the bodies of the orcs that fell down around the boss monster on the stage began to wiggle. They were the orcs who sacrificed themselves to create the black smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, all their skin was blown away, and their red pupils lit up over their white bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, what the heck is that…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That transformation frightened Jisu and Hanho. Twenty orc skeletons were resurrecting all at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the chief orc also watched the surroundings in a tense state.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Skeletons were standing up in all directions. Even the goblin bodies hanging in the air resurrected and shook their bodies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After taking in the “Breath of the Abyss” created by the chief orc, the stats temporarily increased dramatically, so the maximum number of subordinates Sungwoo could control was now 59.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result of resurrecting all the bodies in the vicinity, 33 skeletons were activated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Synergy effect’ is now active because of your team play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, why are there so many of them?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was not the end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo almost felt dizzy because of the fantastic message before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Synergy list]<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Warrior (1st stage)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Details omitted<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) One-armed Warrior<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Details omitted<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Savage Warrior (3rd stage)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Weapon Synergy<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: 30 or more axes<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Attack power increase (15%), attack speed increase (+15%) for 20 seconds at the start of battle *Standby time 10 minutes<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>4) Orc Hunter (2nd stage)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Tribe Synergy<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: More than 30 orcs<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Probability of detecting nearby enemies (+20%), attack power increase in case of war (+10%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>5) Resurrected (3rd stage)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Synergy<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: 30 or more undead traits<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Random resurrection (5), movement speed increase while chasing a living being (+20%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>6) Squad Organization (Hidden)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Member synergy<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: Commander (1st stage) trait + more than 11 normal members<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Attack power increase (+5%), defense power increase (+5%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was crazy… As many as six synergy lists were created.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>And the synergy list could be confirmed by Jisu and Hanho who were on Sungwoo’s team.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, are you kidding me?” Hanho blurted out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way, this is impossible,” quipped Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, even I feel like it’s just amazing…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, the axe buff was not given to those holding the swords. But it was obvious that the six synergy lists were a tremendous bonus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This proved once again that 30 obedient skeletons were much more helpful than 60 stupid humans.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, what the heck is this squad organization?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the synergy of  that Sungwoo particularly paid attention to. This was a synergy that could be activated thanks to the ‘Commander (1st stage)’ trait, which was obtained by Right when it killed the chief goblin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, there was a synergy that came with only a few weapons and a few undead, but there was also a special synergy that could be triggered only when the hidden conditions were met.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Anyway, this is a jackpot!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The chief orc did not dare to move forward first. Although it was a boss monster with overwhelming power incomparable to a mere monster, there were too many skeletons surrounding it now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the boss also sensed some unknown energy in each of the skeletons, namely the synergy effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, we’ll move first.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle, rattle—<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orc skeletons closed in on the boss. At that moment, the boss orc’s thigh and forearm swelled up like a balloon. It began wielding the mace clockwise.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, its force was enormous. The heads of two orc skeletons were smashed and their debris scattered in all directions. However, one of them emitted some red energy and reassembled its body in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The orc skeleton has been resurrected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the synergistic effect of , but four more could be revived in the future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The chief orc lowered its posture as if he was embarrassed, and avoided several flying axes. Then it wielded the mace and smashed a skull, forcing its way into them to make an opening for itself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘You can’t escape.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was expecting its attempt at an escape. At that moment, the goblin skeleton, hanging from the ceiling, tore off the rope and dropped right above the boss’ head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle—<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although it was a small monster with no weapons, its surprise attack was very effective.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The boss, frightened, wriggled and shook its head with his left arm.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>It was a fleeting moment, but unnecessary actions during an urgent battle would make a big difference.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The axe was stabbed into the boss’s back. It hurriedly readjusted its posture to counterattack, but soon another axe smashed its left shoulder, and another axe cut its side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a painful roar and blood pouring on the floor, the boss wielded the mace frantically to stop the skeletons’ approach.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Boowoong! Boowoong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The mace was dreadful mainly because of its psychological threat, given that it could fly at any unpredictable moment. But the mace was only a heavy and slow weapon when the other party charged at it recklessly.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>As it turned out, the boss’ opponents were the skeletons that were not afraid of attacking and being killed at all. Now the skeletons were moving into the striking range of the mace.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The skeletons kept stabbing the axes into the boss, which was covered with blood all over its body instantly. Long stab wounds decorated its entire body, and the bleeding began.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>The boss, gasping for breath, hunched over as if it had no more power to wield the mace. And eventually it missed the mace.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, in the boss’s last moment, the orc skeletons stopped suddenly and stepped aside.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The boss struggled to raise its head. It saw something walking toward it in its blurry eyes. Rattle, rattle—<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the goblin skeleton, Right.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“Cut it!”<br/><br/>2 </div><h2 id="chapter24">Chapter 24</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo gave the order, Right drew the sword, then approached the boss that had run out of steam.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The boss would never have imagined it would be beheaded by a little goblin like Right.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the boss’s neck was cut and it fell on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 1,055 gold by hunting the strengthened boss monster: Lesser Black Conjuror Orc Chief.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the message Sungwoo anticipated came out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Goblin Skeleton (Elite) has been upgraded by absorbing the magical power of ‘Chief Orc.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Defense power has been significantly increased.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* ‘Commander’ trait upgraded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As expected, my subordinates can obtain EXP when they hunt the boss.”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>In general, Sungwoo could level up by catching monsters. However, his subordinates rarely leveled up. The only time they did was when Right cut the boss.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t forget that tip.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>[Subordinates list (33/59)]<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Goblin Skeleton Veteran (LV. 3)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Weapon: Japanese sword or saber<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>* Race: Goblin<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Trait Undead + Commander (Level 2)<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, when the goblin skeleton leveled up to 3, the modifier changed from ‘elite’ to ‘veteran.’ In addition, the ‘Commander’ trait reached 2nd stage, and accordingly the synergy of the organization was adjusted from ‘squad’ to ‘platoon.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, are you now a platoon leader?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crackle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A mere goblin became a platoon leader that controlled 30 orc skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, Sungwoo, something is coming out of the boss’s mouth!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Hanho said, something was flashing in the boss’s cut head, or in its mouth more specifically.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a round object. At first glance, it looked like a black pearl. However, black smoke was coming out of it in all directions, so Sungwoo felt crept out to extend his hand.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>‘But it is definitely an item.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo reached out furtively. At that moment, however, a warning message appeared suddenly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! This item grants the ‘devil’ trait, depending on the owner. Subsequently, you will have to sacrifice a lot to get rid of that trait.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Devil? Did the black magician borrow the devil’s power? So, the situation developed like that?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could not help but hesitate before this dreadful message. But like how the ‘Breath of the Abyss’ became a tremendous buff to him, he wondered if any curse or sacrifice would work out differently for him. If so, wasn’t it a huge opportunity?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The devil…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, its connotation was not good. But …<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, it’s nothing different from Necromancer.”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Then he picked up the black pearl.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment Sungwoo picked it up, the unpleasant smoke emanating from all sides stopped.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woowoo—<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, all the energy began to flow into Sungwoo’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He felt like a snake was crawling up from the tip of his finger. And he stopped feeling it when it reached his heart.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Demon’ trait has been given.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The demon trait is one of the factors that can trigger a hidden synergy like Commander tribute,’ Sungwoo murmured.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No synergy was triggered right now, but he didn’t know what effect it would have in the future, just like how the commander created the  synergy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item Information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Demon Blood Stone<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Rating: Legend<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Orb<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Demonic trait given to its possessor. When attacking, mana is robbed (-2%).<br/><br/><br/><br/>*When the rival’s mana pool is dried up, it will eat away at Physical Strength.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“······.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another legendary grade? Now, it seemed like obtaining a ‘legend’ grade was too easy.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Sungwoo had obtained two in a day. For example, he got an item where the modifier ‘Lesser Black Magician’ was added…<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, it’s a plus for me anyway.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Black Magician, demon, and the Breath of Abyss. He remembered these three keywords. Strangely enough, he felt something like a sweet scent from the dark and slimy words. ‘Obviously that area is related to Necromancer. Otherwise, the Wider Curse can’t give me buffs.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo put the Demon Blood Stone in his pocket.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, are you on close terms with the game host?” asked Hanho.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Watching Sungwoo’s fantastic achievements, Hanho was puzzled by what he had gone through up until now. He really could not understand how Sungwoo, whom he knew very well, could carry out such a ridiculous performance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know, but I think it’s fortunate you’re on friendly terms with me. Haha.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I admit that, of course. But how come you can control such a large number of skeletons…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho looked at the skeletons behind his back with a perplexed expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But at that very moment, the skeletons’ bodies collapsed all at once, and only nine were left.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“…Huh? They were right before my eyes a moment ago…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, they just called it a day.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-All the accumulated ‘Breath of the Abyss’ in your body has been used up, and the ‘1st stimulant’ status has been canceled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The first stimulant? I feel so good.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>To Sungwoo, it was a thrilling midsummer night’s dream. Unfortunately, he remembered this sweetness and he seemed to feel the desire to reach that level as soon as possible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He felt something so thrilling while explaining with words, so he wanted to experience it once again, although he didn’t know why.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Grr…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, those who had fallen into an abnormal state due to the Breath of the Abyss began to wake up one by one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“My head aches so much.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh! Ah!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How can I be alive? What happened to that man?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as they woke up, they started looking for Sungwoo first. It seemed that they felt anxious if Sungwoo was not around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you so much! I really didn’t want to cause any trouble to you…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you for saving my life!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You’re truly a hero.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Despite the mountain of praises, Sungwoo just listened and nodded calmly. Of course, he didn’t take their praises as granted. Actually, he wanted to stay away from them as they might have to cling to him again.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>‘As expected, I don’t need other men.’<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>He once again realized it, then silently left the gym. He didn’t know what the situation was like outside of the school, but not getting tangled with lots of people would be good for survival.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>In no time, the seal of the school gate was broken. But the situation outside the school was still quiet. Daehak St., which was normally noisy with students and cars at the intersection, was quiet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, is it okay for us to leave now??”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I would rather stay here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The roads outside the gates were entangled with all sorts of cars that had stopped. Since the bodies of humans and monsters were strewn everywhere, they were reminded of hell which nobody had ever seen before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The survivors standing in front of the gate could not move out readily. On the one hand, they were checking Sungwoo’s facial expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I wonder where he is going now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No idea…but I think it would be safe to follow him.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Annoyed, Sungwoo ignored their gazes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it, the whole world is really the same as this place. I wonder if my parents are safe…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly Hanho made a dark expression because he was concerned about his parents. The biggest worry was that he could not check his family’s life and death situation because his cell phone was dead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In this regard, Sungwoo felt rather comfortable. He had experienced trauma over the loss of his whole family in an accident a long time ago, but at this moment he didn’t have to worry about them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woowoowoong—<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, two shuttle buses approached from behind. Soon the driver’s window rolled down and Kyongsu stuck out his face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hop in! The road here sucks, but I still think getting on the bus will be safer than walking. As a retired army driver, I know the location of a nearby military unit. So, let’s drive there anyway.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I am fine. I’ve got to go somewhere.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is your house nearby?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes.” Of course, that was a lie.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then I can’t help you. I will leave here with the other survivors.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then Kyongsu picked up most of the hesitant survivors in front of the gate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Still, Kyongsu asked if he was really alright, feeling a bit uncomfortable about leaving him behind. But Sungwoo’s reply was firm.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then… good luck. Hahaha, I didn’t know I was going to say goodbye like they do in the movies.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“You bet. Good luck to you too.” </div><h2 id="chapter25">Chapter 25</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The two buses began to crawl on the road entangled with the bodies of goblins and people as well as cars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After the buses disappeared, Sungwoo, Hanho, Jisu, and 9 skeletons were left behind.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>“Where are we going now? Oh, where is your house, Jisu?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t normal to think about going back home in this situation, but there was no other question to ask now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I used to live in the school dorm because my house is on Jeju Island…”<br/><br/>8<br/><br/>“I see.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was literally impossible to go back to Jeju Island at this point. Hesitant about what to say next, she opened and closed her mouth a few times, then looked at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, Sungwoo, can I come with you?”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>In fact, she noticed that he was reluctant to leave with the others. However, there was nothing safer than being around him at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know if I can help you, but…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Of course you are helpful.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, thank you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She laughed responsively since he replied in the positive unexpectedly. She thought it was very fortunate to be with him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I don’t have to ask you, right?” said Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I’ve one condition.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is it? Just tell me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I want you to be a One-armed Warrior.”<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>“···”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I was wondering if we could have better synergy with two One-armed Warriors.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s joking continued when she suddenly yanked his arm.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Lower your body!”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Along with a gust of wind that shook the heavy vehicles, dozens of giant shadows filled the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woowoong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Creatures with tent-like wings passed through the sky. A giant body, sharp claws, and a mouth like an alligator’s that shone at the end of its long neck… The unrealistic figure of a creature swept past their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Dragon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Field Boss ‘Wyvern Alphamale’ has appeared.<br/><br/>14<br/><br/>Wyvern was commonly known as an inferior dragon species. The Wyvern party lay flat under a tree and did not move at all. Fortunately, Sungwoo’s party could avoid their attack because the Wyverns hadn’t noticed them yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the shuttle bus that wasn’t too far from campus yet was in trouble. The bus that Kyongsu was driving stopped early on, so it was not targeted, but the other one that tried to escape was noticed by the Wyverns immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two Wyverns descended in an instant. Even one looked bigger than the bus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When two such monsters grabbed the ceiling of the bus and clasped it with their wings, the bus was lifted into the air.<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhh! Save us!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Along with the screaming of the people inside, the body of the bus was torn like a sheet of paper. Then Wyvern’s heads broke into the gap and pulled them out one by one and started eating like a bird eating the larvae of a beehive.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Someone opened the window and jumped off boldly, but he was caught in the air and disappeared into the crocodile-like mouth. It was a one-sided massacre.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching that cruel scene, Sungwoo realized that he alone was not strong enough.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But he could be stronger now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Jisu, you can come with me if you accept one condition.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What, what is it?” she asked tensely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re going to hunt the monsters actively. We won’t avoid them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Really?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I told you that you have to adapt yourself to the situation, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, yes.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You should not be content with just adapting. In that case, you can only change your fate from an easy prey to a difficult one.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Humans finally came to dominate the Earth because they controlled nature, which was beyond adapting to nature.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo prepared for hunting on a wider hunting ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your tutorial is now complete.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The goblin was running. Frightened, it ran like crazy to survive. It believed it could be safe once it reached the village by running a little further.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The goblin opened the glass door. It was a franchise sundae (Korean sausage) house.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Now it was now a new home for the goblins, and it was made like a tent by putting all kinds of clothes on the table. In some respects, it was their own personal space.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak! Squeak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As there was a big fuss when the door opened, several goblins crawled from underneath the table. At that moment, a shadow appeared behind the back of the goblin who just fled into the house.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle—<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the goblin slowly turned its head, two giant skeletons stood in front of the glass door.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak! Squeak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The goblins, frightened, started running away. They didn’t dare to fight because they instinctively knew that the skeletons were too tough for fighting, so they didn’t challenge them. The goblins took their weapons and ran into the kitchen. In the corner of the kitchen was a back door leading to an alleyway. The goblin at the forefront hurriedly opened the door.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I knew it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Surprisingly, there was something blocking them at the front door. It was a big shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A longsword pierced the goblin’s neck. The face behind the shield was also Sungwoo’s.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He pushed into the kitchen with an expressionless look.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tramp, tramp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The goblins never dreamed of dealing with shields as tall as their height. They just stepped back, but Sungwoo brandished the saber at them mercilessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned ten gold by hunting goblins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, two orc skeletons were moving forward, blocking the goblins’ escape. At that moment, the goblins, inferior to the orcs intrinsically, had no choice but to fall prey to them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho, who came in late after Sungwoo, smacked his lips. Kitchen tiles were stained with blood all over, but it was a familiar scene to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, you have got them all by yourself!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I didn’t enjoy them, though.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>One day passed after they escaped from campus. For the past two days, they seemed to have hunted as many as hundreds of goblins, so much so that low-level monsters were piled up as the day passed. And the number of goblins caught in those two days seemed to be piled up like a mountain in alleys and malls like bugs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 6)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t think I focus on hunting goblins only.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Actually I hunted countless times for two days, but I only went up one level.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was too slow. From a gaming perspective, it was time to move hunting grounds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Choose a level-up card.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Stat (Random)<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Skill (Random)<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Items (Random)<br/><br/><br/><br/>4) Other (Random)<br/><br/><br/><br/>5) Muscle strength increased by 3 (Confirmed)<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time, Sungwoo was interested in No 5, the confirmed bonus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The confirmed bonus he got until now was only one ‘Muscle Strength’ increase at most.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Muscle Strength 3 is an opportunity that I can’t miss.’<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>If it was inflated by threefold, it was clear that he could not get it through random selection.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Muscle Strength has increased. (+3)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment he selected Muscle Strength, he felt his whole body getting hot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It felt as if his muscles were heating up and swelling. Sungwoo looked down at his palm.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I feel different.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He found it hard to explain, but his body felt like it was full of strength, just like what he felt right after weight training.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Player profile]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Sungwoo Yu<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Level: 6<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Occupation: Necromancer<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Ability: Muscle Strength (8), Agility (5), Physical Strength (5),<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>-Gold Reserve: 5,837<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Trait: Demon<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, some messages constantly appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have gained ten gold by hunting a goblin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have gained eight gold by hunting a goblin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have gained 20 gold by hunting a goblin warrior.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A big noise came from the shop over the wall. Divided into teams, they hunted the goblins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo and Hanho went into the store next to the restaurant, the situation was already over. Jisoo was wiping the blood of the blade with a dishcloth in the middle of the messy restaurant.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“There you go! There were nine goblins here. I got them all.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As she pointed at one corner with the blade, several goblin bodies were seen under the feet of an orc skeleton standing there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good job. Hanho, collect the daggers.” </div><h2 id="chapter26">Chapter 26</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>When they hunted goblins, they could gain some ‘crude daggers.’ When they hunted high-level monsters such as a “Goblin Warrior” or a “Chief Goblin,’ they could obtain some ‘crude spears.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>But they were bulky and useless.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the daggers, as they had been so far, were fairly powerful weapons for a ranged fight. That’s why Sungho didn’t neglect the daggers and collected them.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“Open the hard-case fishing bag.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyway, Sungwoo had enough workers to carry the baggage. Nine skeletons were carrying different bags captured on the road, which contained food and daily necessities looted from convenience stores as well as daggers obtained from goblins.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>In particular, the hard-case fishing bag was perfect for storing sharp daggers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, let’s ignore the goblins from now on,” said Sungwoo, getting out of the snack house.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? Why? Are you tired of hunting goblins now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you going to hunt stronger monsters?” asked Jisu, reading his mind correctly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Right. The gold I get by hunting an orc is 80 won, but a goblin is worth only 10 won. So far, I’ve focused on goblins, but I think there must be a bunch of guys with bigger bonuses somewhere.”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>They went out of the mall to the main street to find bigger prey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they came out to a wide-open place, they were a bit worried when and where monsters like Wyverns might hit them. But they thought they should not even dream of catching a big fish if they were afraid to go out into the river for fear they might be worried about falling into the deep end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, it looks like a scene from a zombie movie.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Hanho said, the endless traffic on the four-lane roads was not only alien, but also horrible enough to make them see terrible illusions. Indeed, the bodies scattered all over the place created a bizarre atmosphere and made them feel like vomiting because of the bad smell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, isn’t that an army vehicle?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho raised his finger. Then they saw a green army truck lined up on the right lane.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that it was carrying troops, but unfortunately there were several bodies of soldiers around it. One strange thing was that nobody was carrying a rifle.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>‘Did they fight with entrenching shovels?’<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>In fact, entrenching shovels were strewn on the ground here and there. It was clear that the soldiers fought the monsters with the shovels as their weapon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s find out if there is something useful. Military items may not be as sturdy as you might think, but maybe we can find a gun…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Approaching the truck, Sungwoo stopped momentarily. The driver’s door of the military truck opened and someone walked out. He was a soldier with a rank of private first class, but he still held an entrenching shovel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, you’re a human being, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What came out of his mouth was an unimaginable question.<br/><br/><br/><br/>How should Sungwoo answer?<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“What the heck is that in the back…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only then did Sungwoo understand why he asked that question. The soldier saw a group of skeletons following Sungwoo up close.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do not worry.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He did not explain what the white things were. Nonetheless, the private-first class soldier seemed a bit relaxed. So, Sungwoo turned his head and looked at the assistant driver’s seat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sergeant Kim, they are humans!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then someone said from inside, “Hey, dude, I can immediately recognize they’re humans. Do you think they look like goblins?”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>When Sungwoo approached and checked inside, a soldier was sitting in the passenger seat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He frowned, staring at Sungwoo, and nodded his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As you can see, I can’t go out because I’ve got leg problems.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His right thigh was swollen red.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You were stabbed by a goblin dagger.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, I feel so crappy because I was attacked by an elementary boy-looking goblin. I didn’t spend 18 months in the army to get this. I’m good at martial arts, but… Argh, damn it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What happened? Were the soldiers here attacked by goblins?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sergeant Kim laughed at his question.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, we were robbed by goblins. In fact, we knocked down all the goblins, but the problem was what happened next.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Knocked them down? You guys didn’t fire any live ammunition?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, Kim thought if they had guns, they could easily kill goblins and orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Well, we couldn’t fire the bullets.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was an unexpected answer, but Sungwoo wasn’t surprised because he thought this game system could be destroyed by the humans’ military power. But how come the guns wouldn’t function at all?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It wasn’t a malfunction, but our unit officers said they didn’t know the cause. So, as you can see, we all fought with entrenching shovels or bayonets. Well, we could knock down the goblins, but…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Hanho came over from behind Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I’ve got potions…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho had potions for recovery. The sergeant’s eyes opened wide.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I know what that is…I saw the guy, my replacement ‘player’ carrying it. Could you help me?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sergeant Kim asked while looking at Sungwoo, but felt his expression was very cold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon Sungwoo opened his mouth, “As you might know, it’s hard for me to give it to you in a situation related to our survival.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Kim made another proposal without embarrassment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, how about this? Let me tell you all I have seen and heard so far. Regardless of potions, nothing is as important as intelligence in this damned situation. If you try to confront them, you’re going to be crippled like me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m not sure if your tips are worthwhile.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can reassure you. You don’t think there are only goblins or orcs in front of this road, do you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After hearing it, Sungwoo reached out to Hanho who then placed a small bottle in his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then let me judge after hearing what you have to say. If you insist on potions first, we’ll pass by right away.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kim nodded at his resolute reply and said, “It was the wolves that destroyed our troops here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wolves?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Yes. I don’t know what it is because we couldn’t catch even one, but wolves were the size of bulls. And wolves tend to move around in packs. If I hadn’t been stupidly stabbed in the thigh by a goblin, I would have been eaten by the wolves.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, is that the end of the story?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ll tell you one more thing. You may already know this, but have you seen the blue QR code?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at Jisu and Hanho. Both shook their heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Oh, this tip is much more valuable than the potions.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sergeant Kim seemed to be condescending, but he opened his mouth in no time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ve seen two so far. There is one at the Suyong Intersection Bus Stop if you keep going this way, and the other one is at the Suwon Station Transfer Center. Scan it on your cell phone.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What do you see there?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“One application will be downloaded. In this damned situation where even shortwave radios can’t work, it’s the only community where you can communicate with survivors. I can’t prove it because my cell phone was smashed. I’m not lying to you now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Community?<br/><br/><br/><br/>After hearing that, Sungwoo gave the potions to him. Kim picked it up quickly and drank it hurriedly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dang it. I’m a dumbass expecting it to be strawberry flavored. Oh my…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He looked surprised by the effects. Soon he opened the passenger seat door and got out of the car.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This game stabs and kills me at the same time! Where are you going? We will return to the unit.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you think your unit is safe?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“When the first ‘player’ appeared, the officers collected all the weapons. Stupid bastards. Then they told us to fight with entrenching shovels. Perhaps the troops left in the unit must have realized the seriousness of the situation and are using weapons now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, Kim pulled down something from his gear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…As you know, the army doesn’t change until accidents happen.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Well, we have to go somewhere.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good it. Then, good luck.”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Now, it seemed that such pleasantries were a common greeting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You, too. Oh, and watch out for the sky.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At Sungwoo’s advice, Kim looked up at the sky with his puzzled expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sky?” </div><h2 id="chapter27">Chapter 27</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Did you say they were bull-sized wolves? Bus-sized crocodiles are flying in the sky.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Surprisingly, I can believe it. Thank you for that free tip.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two soldiers said goodbye to Sungwoo’s party and disappeared in the opposite direction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As Kim said, Sungwoo’s party found a blue QR code at the Suyong Intersection Bus Stop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fortunately, their cell phones had some battery left. No phone or internet was available, but they carried their cell phones anyway just in case.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo, Hanho, and Jisu scanned the blue QR code with their phones. The code was entangled in a rather bizarre pattern, like an ancient letter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Kim said, an APK extension file was installed and the application was installed on their phones.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>“What? I wonder if it’s a virus, Sungwoo.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What does it matter? You can’t use your phone anyway.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, damn it. I changed it only a month ago!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Your lifespan may be less than a month, so be quiet.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon the application ran automatically.<br/><br/><br/><br/>「Player Guidebook」<br/><br/><br/><br/>-This program is designed for the smooth survival of the ‘player.’<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Guidebook?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A few menus were displayed after the loading screen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>━ Player Guidebook<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1.

Then he saw one notice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1] Guide on Official Service Start<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Preparation: Host │ Views: 398,433<br/><br/><br/><br/>Official service began today. Through the first job card selection process, a total of 2,967,821 people were selected as players, and 1,341,112 people have survived as of now and are still playing. As the second player selection is scheduled in three days, we hope that many humans will actively choose the “cards.”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>* Comments are disabled on this post.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>They read the notice, then they were silent. However, they were all wondering about one thing: Who the hell was doing this?<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Sungwoo accessed the ‘bulletin board.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>– There are no posts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were 400,000 views on this notice, but how come there were no posts on the bulletin board? So, Sungwoo clicked the [Post thread] button at the bottom of the screen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-1,000 gold is required to post a thread. [YES/NO]<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That means you have to hunt 100 goblins to post a thread? Damn it. Our two days of hard hunting is worth only this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>1,000 gold was directly related to their survival. No matter how much gold they earned, they could not afford to waste this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No other bulletin board was accessible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the moment, when Sungwoo was about to exit the application, a thread was posted on the bulletin board for the first time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[1] Is anyone out there?<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>-Posted by: kor-4884 │ Views: 2<br/><br/><br/><br/>If so, please comment!

He immediately clicked the NO button.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Hanho was still examining the post.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“H Apartments are near my house!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shall we go there?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho widened his eyes at that because his family members who he couldn’t call might still be there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why don’t we stop by your house and meet the author of this post?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Didn’t they say they already achieved Level 8 and easily used 1,000 gold?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though Sungwoo hunted so many monsters, Sungwoo was still Level 6.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Something is fishy here…but it’s also necessary to meet a high-level group that has survived on its own.’<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Because he met Sergeant Kim, Sungwoo could figure out how the community worked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like he said, nothing was as important as intelligence in a situation like this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This way? Let’s go.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They headed for the H Apartments. Even at that moment, comments were being posted on the bulletin board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>「Comment: 5」<br/><br/><br/><br/>─ kor-1461: Uh? Are you serious? You’re nearby.

Come carefully.<br/><br/>11<br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party set the H Apartments as their destination and kept walking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And they were passing by a residential district.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There are only monsters on the streets.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, they bumped into a number of goblins as well as a group of seven orc hunters. Of course, they were soft targets by now, but the monsters were in complete control of the streets, so they were everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But how come we haven’t seen a single person?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You saw one through the window.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I wonder if I can say I saw.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Most of the survivors were hiding inside buildings and looking at the world through the curtains. It seemed as if they were watching Sungwoo’s party with caution. They were just crouching there, waiting for the government to come and rescue them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come to think of it, it’s natural that they are hiding in their houses.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho nodded at Jisu’s words.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I admit it. I wouldn’t think of going out, probably, well, until the food runs out.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, that was the problem. Soon food will run out and they will have no other choice but to go out. They will have to spend as much time adapting to this crazy world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That is the fate of those who started late.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And what will happen to the structure of this world?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought that when the government and the army no longer functioned, those who were empowered by the rules of the game would lead the survivors and rule the world. It was a very clear result that one could realize without thinking hard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, a bunch of goblins!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, once again realizing the importance of power, Sungwoo pulled the saber.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was another battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak! Squeak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seven goblins were running around in the middle of a residential street, and they were surrounding and threatening somebody.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get out of here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A man in his 30s was swinging a baseball bat and blocking their approach. A little girl behind his who seemed to be his daughter was shivering with fear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please help me!” he shouted desperately, but the windows in the residential area were tightly closed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even the slightly opened curtains were pulled down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nobody wanted to get caught up in this situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, the weaker one was, the more likely one was to become selfish because they could not be bold enough.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was bolder than anyone else because he had nine monsters that could attack the opponents on his behalf.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they felt a human presence, the goblins turned around, and soon their eyes began to tremble. But it was too late for them to escape.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were showered with flying daggers and annihilated at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the orc skeletons appeared, the man dropped the bat, with his face turning white because they were like monsters in his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man could confront the goblins in one way or another, but he couldn’t even dare to fight them. At that moment Sungwoo emerged among them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now you’re fine.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo placed his hand on the shoulder of the man covered with cold sweat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His eyes were still full of suspicion, but his rough breathing gradually subsided. He hugged his little daughter tightly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He would have feared that his daughter would die because he could not help.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo understood his feelings dimly.<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter28">Chapter 28</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“When the card popped up in front of your eyes, you didn’t pick it up, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“… No.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Where are you living? I’ll take you. Three days later, the cards will come up again. Then, choose the one with the most stars.”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t want to take this poor man and his daughter with him. He just wanted to provide them with as much information as possible for survival.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my house is right over there…I came out because the food was running out…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He understood the situation. Sungwoo opened the bag and provided him with only 3 days of food that could sustain them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, goodbye…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, the goblins cried.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two goblins coming out of the mouth of the alley witnessed the corpses of their fellow goblins everywhere. They were so startled that they quickly went down to the basement of an old shop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my goodness. How stupid they are! They are running to a dead end. Can I go and beat them up?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wait a minute.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at the man again. Even if he didn’t take the man and his daughter with him, he could not neglect them on the street.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, well, my house is right in this alley. I can get there safely, I think…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, good luck!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, by the way, I do not recommend you going down the basement. It’s a karaoke room run by someone that I know… I heard there are more terrible animals than those green beasts living out there,” the man warned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded and let them go. Then he stood in front of the underground stairs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a red cave-shaped icon in contrast to the green coin-shaped icon. It was the so-called ‘dungeon’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go down.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Despite the man’s warning, Sungwoo would not listen to it because the standard of fear was very different among people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He warned something terrible is living there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, it means that there are lots of nutrients out there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Sungwoo, you have become weird these days.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Otherwise I’d be dead already.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orc skeletons under Sungwoo’s authority lined up and started to descend the stairs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since it was an old merchant shop in a residential area, the old stairs squeaked loudly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was on edge because of that noise. He passed ‘Off-limits to Youth after 10:00 PM’ sign and opened the door to the dark karaoke hall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment Hanho screamed, “Ahhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What’s wrong?” Sungwoo said, pulling a sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Bones, bones…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were lots of bones piled up at the place where Hanho pointed to. There was a pile of decomposed and decayed things such as humans, goblins, orcs, etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Are you scared about the bones?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crackle—<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right, the one-armed goblin standing next to Sungwoo, also looked up at Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Letting out a sigh, Sungwoo rummaged through his bag, then took out an LED light he had obtained from a bicycle shop. There were a total of eight LED lights, so Sungwoo, Hanho, and Jisu held one each while he installed the other five on the ribs of the orc skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, like a special force entering a dark room, several lights began to beam around here and there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go in.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have entered the unique dungeon ‘The Holy Land of Elder Slime.’<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>“Slime?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Aren’t they completely weak guys? By the way, what the heck is this smell? Uh…”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>In a fantasy world, slimes were set as weak monsters, but their origin was more of a munchkin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since slimes were free of form and made of acidic substances that melt anything, they were very difficult to deal with. Indeed, the huge stinky smell from them filled the basement karaoke hall. The stink was strong enough to cause a headache.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What caught their eyes first was a goblin’s legs, which stuck out of the door of Room 1. It seemed to be one of the goblins that had run away here a little while ago.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they approached slowly and confirmed it, Hanho and Jisu stepped back, blocking their noises.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Ugh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were struck by an unbearable stench.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this smell?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The stench came from the goblin. Its legs were shaking, but a translucent jelly-shaped object stuck to its face. It was none other than the slime.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Upon closer examination, its facial skin had completely melted, revealing the skull. The acid of the slime melted its protein and sent out a terrible odor. When they turned the light inside Room 1, there was a pile of slime there.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“Damn it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The goblins were stuck on all kinds of items, such as family sofas or wooden tables, but they were melted completely so they could not be recognized at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuruk! Kuruk! Kurk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Because they lived in the dark place by nature, they seemed to react sensitively to light. Then they made a strange sound and started to crawl with their bodies twitching. Slimes began pouring out of not only Room 1 but also Room 2 and 3, and other rooms. There were so many of them that Sungwoo and his party even mistook it as water flowing coming out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuruk! Kuruk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party stepped back. How were they supposed to attack that liquid mass monster? Is it even useful to hit them with swords? They were at a loss about how to attack because they had never seen such creatures before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, shall we go up again?” Jisu asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…I don’t want to melt and die.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was terrible even to think about melting and dying, just like the goblins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Goblin?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo recalled the goblin bodies with only bones and the bones accumulated at the entrance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, these slimes can’t digest bones?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crackle, crackle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But, unfortunately, the orc skeletons were all bones that the slimes could not eat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, a slime got stuck on the legs of an orc skeleton and then quickly fell off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clearly it knew thatthe skeleton was not its prey.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Oh, this is going to …”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Obviously there appeared the right conquerors in the kingdom of slimes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The axe knocked down the jelly. The jelly seemed to push away the axe, but it quickly broke apart and swallowed the axe blade.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The axe blade boiled and contained weak bubbles. Corrosion was fatal to iron, but it was not imminent. The orc skeleton pulled the ax and disassembled the slime right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party stood at the counter, leisurely watching the skeletons hunting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They didn’t need to go between the smelly and dangerous slimes because the orc skeletons were getting rid of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 140 by hunting a small slime.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>-You have earned 140 by hunting a small slime.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It might not be fair for Sungwoo alone to take the credit for hunting, but he really didn’t want to confront them. It seemed that the hunting was going on very well, but the situation changed when two skeletons died one after another.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your subordinate has returned to eternal death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your subordinate has returned to eternal death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Something happened. There’s a variable.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go inside.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, Sungwoo walked into the karaoke hall, holding a shield. The disassembled jellies stuck firmly to the walls and floor. The variable was in the room at the end of the corridor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The boss monster ‘Elder Slime’ has appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, the boss is basically huge.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It stinks more.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A brown liquid mass was curled up on one side of the large special room. It was more than 3 meters in width, but piles of bones were strewn on both sides. It took an orc skeleton in its body, crushed it, and started spitting bones side to side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tuk-tuuk-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bones were piled even higher.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Even if it can’t eat them, it can crush the skeleton by chewing it up?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo frowned at the terrible scene. The hall was full of the stench from that huge slime.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was dirty as if the jelly toy he played with as a child was rolling on with the filth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Step back, guys!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo ordered the skeletons to move back because it was not easy to smash such a bulky body with the axe. Its body was so viscous that it would be restored as soon as it was cut.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t have bones to use now,” Sungwoo murmured. </div><h2 id="chapter29">Chapter 29</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Besides, he could not find replacements for the orc skeletons now. Although all sorts of bones were strewn around, he could not use them because they were all smashed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, how about this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo raised his arm. Then the piles of bones on both sides of the elder slime began to shake. And the next moment, pointy things popped out of a pile of bones, stabbing into the body of the Elder Slime.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were the spears created with  skills. Even though he could not resurrect the skeletons with the broken bones, he could make as many weapons as he wanted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Screeching at the tip of the incoming spears, the Elder Slime shook its body. It twisted its whole body to shake them off, but it couldn’t move properly. Dozens of spears made of bones stabbed both sides, fixing it like a support fixture or a pin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, disassemble it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle—Rattle—<br/><br/><br/><br/>At his order, the orc skeletons moved. They started to decompose the slime by hitting its body fixed on a wall with the axes, just like coal miners digging for coals.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the slime did not give up and shook its body violently. Then it stretched its body and swallowed a nearby skeleton with a gulp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quaduk! Quaduk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then it rolled them inside its body and began to grind them finely. Sungwoo felt goosebumps while watching the strong bones of the skeletons being smashed like wooden chopsticks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your subordinate has returned to eternal death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But you made a mistake.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching that, Sungwoo laughed and raised his hand again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then the bones inside the slime’s body were reassembled, creating two spears. The pointed spears poked inside its body roughly.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Kuruk! Kuruk! Kuruk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was still wriggling, but the more it did, the bigger the holes on its body became. The skeletons’ axes broke into its weakened body and ripped off its jelly-like flesh. It didn’t take long for its huge guy to be chopped up into hundreds of pieces. At the last minute, Right stabbed its vital part with the saber.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 2,255 gold by hunting the boss monster ‘Elder Slime.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was it. It was a one-sided battle that Sungwoo’s party won. Right also seemed to have gained EXP by getting rid of the monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. Put its mucus and slime in empty glass or plastic bottles.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crackle, crackle—<br/><br/><br/><br/>At his order, the skeletons opened the bags and took out empty plastic bottles. He was collecting such stuff blindly because he didn’t know when they would be useful. He didn’t have to worry about the porters, namely the skeleton, anyway. The glass and plastic bottles were acid-resistant, so a fairly large amount of acidic liquid was obtained.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I never know when I can use them.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the world is fine, he can get the goods he needs right away, but now he has to collect them unconditionally. When he got rid of the Elder Slime, he noticed a round object in the middle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item Information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Elder Slime’s Core<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Rare<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Classification: Assembling materials<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: This is the Elder Slime’s core. It is covered with a thick shell, but it has strong acidity condensed inside which can melt anything. It can be used to melt or assemble hard objects.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Assembling materials?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He didn’t know where, what, or how to assemble, but he found something to try anyway. He put the Elder Slime’s core in the bag holding the most important things. He wished he had something like an inventory like a real game, but he was fortunate enough to have skeletons.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>Crackle, crackle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>These skeletal guys were still playing an all-round role.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the second night after the hunting game began. Sungwoo’s party decided to spend the night in a detached house. It was an empty house, but there were signs that the owner hastily packed and left the house.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The gas has been disconnected, but we still have electricity and tap water. Would you like to wash up first?” Jisu asked, taking off her training top. As the clothing was red, it wasn’t noticeable, but it was stained with blood everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It looks like you’re in a hurry. Please wash first.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She was already taking out a towel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah. I think I’m going crazy. I just ran five laps around the playground right before this whole mess. Did you smell my sweat?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t worry. The smell of blood was stronger.”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“Ugh. I really think my body reeks of blood.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muttering like that, she went into the bathroom.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although electricity was still on, she didn’t turn on the light deliberately. Only the sound of a shower was heard in the dark bathroom. Sungwoo and Hanho recharged their mobile phones in the living room and checked the ‘Player Guidebook’ application.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“There are still no new posts in the community. This one is the same as before.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, l would save gold and select an item instead of posting there. Anyway, I should find a store and use some gold.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, Sungwoo already had 11,982 gold. Although it was good to see the funds growing, it was necessary to change them into items to increase the survival rate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nobody knew when they would run into a formidable creature.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Slime? It was really lucky for them to have confronted the slimes because the skeletons were their natural enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, look at this comment. Something’s fishy. Why were all the replies deleted?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Hanho said, there were a total of 18 comments on the post that they were making a safety zone inside the H Apartments, but as many as 10 of them were deleted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>─ kor-781: I’m on my way there. Why were all comments deleted?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Kor kor-4884 (author): The world is going crazy, so people are running wild too. There are all sorts of assholes everywhere, so don’t worry about the deleted comments.<br/><br/><br/><br/>─ kor-433: Didn’t the man who said he was coming arrived yet? I’m a bit nervous. Please make some comments!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Kor kor-4884 (author): He hasn’t come yet. Maybe he might have met something bad on his way here. I won’t use gold anymore. Only those who are near here can leave comments.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hmm… Don’t you feel something fishy?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo also read between the lines of the comments carefully.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Somebody wants to act altruistically by using 1,000 gold… But someone else is using as much gold as them to make malicious comments? Why?’ Sungwoo thought to himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously both sides were not normal, but Sungwoo really could not understand the man who kept posting the comments. What benefit was he trying to get? Was he really crazy?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo pondered about it for a while, then raised his head and looked up at Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, Hanho.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah? why?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A shadow was cast on Sungwoo’s face. At that moment, he felt scared about Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can you kill anyone?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even if you kill people, you get gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It’s even easier than hunting a monster, and you get much more gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They give 5,000 gold for an ordinary man, and 1,000 gold per level to a game player.<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>In other words, if you kill a Level 5 player, you can get 5,000 gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Who knew it first? And how did he know it? Was it unprecedented for anybody to kill someone else to get gold? However, those who really tried it could not get out of that thrill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In an underground parking lot with the lights off, a van was parked at the entrance to the ground. However, the bumper of the van was stained with human blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, brother, who the hell is the boss?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The big guy holding the steering wheel asked the skinhead in the passenger seat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, until recently, ‘skinhead’ was used only to refer to any organization’s boss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This skinhead, commonly referred to as “President Park,” was a wastrel from this area. After gathering his minions, he was running an illegal private sports gambling site.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the boss of the gambling organization, he was in the process of solidifying his position in the black market. He was proud that as far as guts were concerned, he would not be outmuscled by anybody.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Dang it. Fuck!”<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter30">Chapter 30</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>But now, his face was turning white with fear at the word ‘boss.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh… Sorry, sorry!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>President Park kept pretending to wash his face, shivering a lot. It looked as if he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fuck…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>One thing came to his mind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When this game began, Members of Park’s organization were gathered in their lodgings because of a general meeting. Since five members, including President Park, became players, they could survive without difficulty.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But President Park acted rashly. He went to a convenience store in front of the apartments, saying that he would scrape out all the cigarettes just in case the world would be ruined.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ha, ha…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, he ran into a man called ‘boss.’ After all, Park had to come back, with his body covered with blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Youngchol.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, brother!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you know a man called Red Professor?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Youngchol was puzzled. Red Professor? It was a name he heard somewhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon he succeeded in recalling that name.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Isn’t that bastard the serial killer roaming around Seoul and Kyonggi Province?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This guy was a serial killer and an unprecedented psychopath murderer who killed 16 serial murders in Kangnam and the southern Kyonggi Province. He cut the legs of the killed, hung their heads and wrote down pedantic words on the bodies, which earned him the title, ‘Red Professor.’<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>He was not caught for more than three years since he committed the crime first, and his identity had not been revealed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That crazy bastard is our boss.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While speaking each word clearly, Park felt his heart was pounding fast.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He still needs blood.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? What did you just say?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, nothing! You fucking asshole!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Park’s eyes were bloodshot. Breaking into a cold sweat, he wrapped his hand around his neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He felt a hot pain on his left neck. And he began to see hallucinations. It was a convenience store. Someone was biting his neck. Then, why did he feel good…?<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>-You have become a subordinate of ”Vampire Road.’<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>-Your occupation has been changed to ‘Lesser Vampire.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How about it? Isn’t it thrilling? Bite somebody. You will feel happy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man’s face was not visible, and the face of his right-hand man that Park took to the convenience store was standing before him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Park approached him, feeling thirst and appetite as if he were a beast.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Brother? What’s wrong with you? Save me! Brother! Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blood splashed on his face, and a man’s voice was heard behind his back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. Nice job. You’re my baby. Keep growing until I come back. Okay?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh! Uh uh… Brother, please…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man’s voice and the smell of blood were so sweet…<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Brother!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Park raised his head at someone’s shouting, then woke up to reality again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Brother?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The youngest of the organization stood in front of the passenger seat window.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, what’s up?” said Park.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ve confirmed the arrival of the hunting prey. This bastard 157. There are three people as seen in the comments. They are standing in the park right now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Saying that, he showed Park his cell phone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>─ kor-157: I’m on my way to H Apartments. There are a total of 3 people, and we’re arriving in ten minutes!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kor kor-157: We have arrived. We’re standing in the park now. Come quickly!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kor kor-4884 (author): Yes, I’m coming right now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay… step on the accelerator!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As Park shouted, swallowing in excitement, Youngchol stepped on the accelerator.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woowoong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>16 people had already been sacrificed after they were lured in like this, struck down by a car to make them moribund and dead, after all. Then Park sucked their blood. The apartments were in the open, but it was easier to attract people. And nobody living in the apartments here protested.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With everybody silent, not daring to stop them, the blood-stained car drove away speedily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woowoong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Again, three scapegoats were standing at the entrance of the central park.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woowoong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time they were quite bulky guys. Wearing the black hoods, they were holding axes. They didn’t care anyway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Blood, blood! Fresh blood!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how strong their build was, they became good prey once they were run over by their car.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The van struck the three gathered together in one place. They couldn’t even flinch.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But at that moment their bodies disintegrated, and the debris poured over the windows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Skeletons?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously they were white bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, the smashed bones bounced back and began to be assembled in a certain form. There were sharp weapons such as a spear, sword, and axe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The windows were broken, and the bonnet was cut. The phenomenon also took place underneath the van. The sharply-assembled bones smashed the body of the van.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the tires were drilled and the engine cut through, the van eventually stopped on its own.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gray smoke came out of the bonnet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dumbfounded by the unexpected situation, Park looked around. At that moment, a shield flew in and broke the passenger seat window.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While Park raised his hand to defend his face, someone flung open the locked car door. Park was pulled out with his collar grabbed. While being dragged over the concrete floor, Park raised his head and looked up at the man who attacked him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who are you…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, 4884…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Holding a shield in his left hand, the young man pulled a long sword in his right hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You must be 4884, you son of a bitch?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>White skeletons began to gather behind him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>**<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first, Sungwoo just thought the deleted comments were suspicious.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He thought that when someone used their valuable gold to post disturbing comments, the author might have done so with the belief that he should notify and correct the wrongdoing of the other party, rather than screwing them over. And the author of the comments probably deleted his posts because he felt a bit guilty while monitoring the posts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘No matter how much I think about it, I think it’s more reasonable to feel that way.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Sungwoo was prepared for any contingencies even before he arrived at the apartment complex, the meeting place. And what he thought was that they might be gangsters trying to extort money from the innocent people, so he sent three skeletons disguised as humans to the rendezvous point. He decided to hide nearby and watch the situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo never expected that the van would run over them recklessly. So, he immediately turned bone fragments into weapons, just like when he hunted Elder Slime.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then the bone weapons smashed the van here and there, making it eventually stop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo quickly pulled the man in the passenger seat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You must be 4884, the son of a bitch, right?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>His nickname was kor-4884. Though Sungwoo didn’t know the reason, the guy with this nickname was obviously attracting and killing the survivors from the community.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who are you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Instead of replying, Sungwoo kicked his face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, the skeletons pulled the bouncer in the driver’s seat. He lay flat on the floor, shivering violently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How many subordinates do you have? If you don’t answer, I’ll smash your head.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lifting the saber, he asked while staring at Park. But Park was looking at him sarcastically.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh-huh! My head? Damn it. Have you killed anybody? Huuuuh! How can you bluff me like this…Ugh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, his face stiffened hard. He lowered his head slightly and looked down at his left hand. Or he looked at where his left hand was. It was cut neatly, with thick blood gushing from it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You now know it. Very good. As I was weak-minded, I couldn’t hit your head right away. But these guys are different.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo slightly stepped aside, an orc skeleton walked toward Park with big strides.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was holding an ax with both hands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Uhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nevertheless, Park began to laugh crazily as if he lost his mind. Was he out of mind due to extreme pain? After all, Sungwoo looked at the other big guy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How about you? Aren’t you going to answer? Your arm or leg, which one do you want me to cut first?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At his asking, he innocently began to confide quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, ah! A total of eight are working for him….Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But he couldn’t finish his answer because he was beheaded at that moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh?”<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter31">Chapter 31</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>It was not what the skeleton did. Park, who was lying on the floor, jumped out instantaneously and cut his man’s neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party quickly stepped back, feeling threatened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuh! Hehe!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Park smiled madly, grabbed, and lifted his man’s hair. On the other hand, a bone was protruding from his left hand which was cut off, and it looked like a dagger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that? He’s crazy!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A long tongue came wriggling out of Park’s mouth. Then he began to suck the blood of the man’s head and its cut area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Park trembled with indescribable pleasure.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then he felt a sense of accomplishment at the message before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your Physical Strength has been restored by sucking blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Stats have increased through a certain amount of bloodsucking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*Muscle strength (+2), Agility (+1), and Physical strength (+1)<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>The moment his boss bit his neck a few days ago, his job changed from “Ninja” to “Lower Vampire.” And there were enormous restrictions on vampires. He could never level up because his level was fixed at 1.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, another way of growth was suggested, which was slaughtering and bloodsucking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It meant that he could get stats by sucking blood from a certain number of people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, he ended up with pretty good physical strength by sacrificing so many people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Muscle strength (14), Agility (13), Physical strength (12)<br/><br/><br/><br/>This number was three times that of typical humans.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Moreover, he now even had unknown buffs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-All stats are temporarily increased due to drastic insanity. (+20%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Reduces stats (-50%) for 10 hours after going back to normal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh-huh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Park wept with satisfaction, then threw the man’s head into the flower bed. Then he rolled his bloodshot eyes and looked at Sungwoo and his friends.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuuuuh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This guy’s occupation is worse than mine. Hide behind me, everybody. He can kill you with one blow.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lifting the shield, he controlled the skeletons. Giant monsters with the axes slowly closed in on Park. The moment the skeletons approaching his back lifted their axes to strike down Park, he turned away and quickly dodged. His bloodshot eyes turned towards Sungwoo. On the other hand, he stretched his right hand upside down, grabbing the skeleton’s neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then he broke its neck at once and the skeleton collapsed. It was a tremendous physical force.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, huh! You’re the captain of these guys, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, he stomped on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Avoid him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He passed through the orc skeleton at a tremendous speed. The distance between him and Sungwoo’s party narrowed in an instant. And the bone growing out of his left arm flew toward Sungwoo’s neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo lifted the shield and barely stopped it. However, the shock was transmitted to his wrist. The hand holding the hard shield ended up with long scratches.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo instinctively stepped back, and Jisu and Hanho also moved back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dang it. I can’t throw a dagger because he’s too fast,” Hanho murmured.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>It seemed that he could kill Park by throwing a dagger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, uh! Who are you? How weak you are! Fuck!” Park muttered, then rushed towards Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tightening his thighs, Sungwoo lifted the shield high. Park threw his left arm down towards the shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The item has been destroyed.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>The shield was split in half with an incredible message. However, Sungwoo calmed down as much as possible and brandished the saber.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Park avoided the attack by leaning back. Then he bounced up with his upper body and struck again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uhhhh. Let me kill you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo lowered his posture by bending his legs. Something stepped on his back and popped out. It was Right, the one-armed goblin and Sungwoo’s faithful ally.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘You’ve been caught!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, right before he headed for the stopped van, Sungwoo placed it in the bush just in case another gang ambushed from behind. And his decision was very effective.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo kept on stepping back to lure Park to the bush, then Right gave him a fatal blow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right jumped, then landed after cutting Park’s right shoulder entirely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His arm cut from the shoulder fell to the ground. It was a fatal injury that couldn’t be compared to his cut wrist. Park began to stumble in tremendous pain and shock.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a group of men poured out from the underground parking lot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Brother!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like the killed bulky man’s testimony, there was a total of 8 people, but they flinched after looking at Park.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His bloodshot eyes were filled with madness, the sharp veins protruded all over his body, and even the sharp bones grew in the cut areas. He was far from a human.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The skeletons charged at Park while his gang was hesitant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While bleeding, Park shook his left arm violently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orc skeleton’s ribs were smashed, and its spine was cut, collapsing in half.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Park moved to check the skeleton moving straight from behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The vampire’s vitality was persistent. But no matter how many times the skeleton was cut, it would resurrect anyway. Park was in for an unexpected attack this time. A gray blade popped out of the space that seemed to have been clogged between the skeleton’s upper body and bones, which had just collapsed from his attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The blade of the sword pierced through Park’s neck, and, at the same time, Sungwoo appeared through a pile of bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Great.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As always, skeletons were the best consumables and bait.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo threw one at the enemies, they surprisingly showed weakness without exception. And the moment skeletons were smashed, their bones were separated, and then they collapsed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo could resurrect them as bone weapons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tightening his arms, Sungwoo now stabbed Park deeply, whose pupils became increasingly blurry.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I love collecting bones, so let me try resurrecting your skull.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo grabbed the bag with both hands and shook it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Park’s head instantly fell off. He collapsed helplessly on the concrete floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 1,000 gold by killing a player (LV. 1).<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>‘Gold by killing a player?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo realized for the first time that he could earn gold by killing a person.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was dumbfounded rather than uncomfortable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it. Is that the reason the bastards did all this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gold was directly related to survival, and hunting monsters was a big risk.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the other hand, hunting one’s friendly race, namely humans, was very easy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crazy bastards.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo raised his head and looked at Park’s gang members. Then, the skeletons approached them right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, what?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the big monsters surrounded them from all sides, their faces turned white.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each of them had weapons, but the tips of the weapons trembled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At a glance, their level was not high. Until now, they killed the survivors by hitting them with a car, and the benefits of such killings were all taken by Park.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You guys are a Level 8 group? Put down your weapons, or you will all die.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At his order, the hesitant guys threw out their weapons at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, please save us!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Answer my questions from now on.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo started interrogating them. As they were surrounded by big white bones all around, they had no choice but to surrender.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After interrogating them, Sungwoo came to realize that Park had planned this right after he met an unidentified human named “Boss” a few days ago.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Boss?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We don’t know who he is. Brother Park just told us we have to obey him.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Since then, our brother has been a bit weird. He once stood in place for a long time, where the murdered corpses were collected…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, Sungwoo could understand nothing about Park, ranging from his monster-like abilities to his weird act of sucking blood from his subordinate’s head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it was certain that there was a crazy guy named “Boss” who turned Park into a monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Is he a human? Then what the heck is your job?’ Sungwoo wondered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Did he choose a five-star or higher job card?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t think there was only one who selected such cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was clear that no matter how low the probability was, there was more than one who selected such cards. So, it became clear that social order would collapse and powerful bums would run wild.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How many people have you killed so far?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Tell the truth.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Twenty-one or two…” </div><h2 id="chapter32">Chapter 32</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sungwoo looked down at them silently with contempt. Soon he turned his head and looked at Right.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crackle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right read his mind and pulled the sword, gnashing its teeth. Then the orc skeletons lifted the axes. They pushed the gang members to the walls and the corners of the apartments.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh! What the heck!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please help me! We just did what we were ordered to do…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were killed one by one with their bloody screams.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 500 gold by killing civilians.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>-You have earned 500 gold by killing civilians.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 2,000 gold by killing a player (LV. 2).<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 3,000 gold by killing a player (LV. 3).<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 1,000 gold by killing a player (LV. 1).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo frowned at the messages appearing before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What’s wrong, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hangho and Jisu seemed shocked by what happened before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ruthless axes and human blood splattered everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how wicked they were, they were not monsters, but humans.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo firmly said, “If you don’t kill them, they will kill somebody else.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Ah, I agree,” Jisu also nodded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although she was reluctant to put blood on her hands, they had to be killed anyway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monstrous bandits of H Apartments were eradicated at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, people kept posting comments on the threads that the gang wrote to lure the survivors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>「Comments: 26」<br/><br/><br/><br/>─ kor-157: We are going to H Apartments.

A little ago 157 set a trap for the monstrous guys and killed them all. 157, are you watching me? I’m in Apartment 103. Can I meet you?

Who the hell is he? By the way, Sergeant Kim, how do I change my ID?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was already becoming famous in the community before he knew it.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Night came again. It was the fourth day since the world turned into a game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho’s house was not far, but it was dangerous to move there at night.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Sungwoo’s party decided to move early in the morning after spending the night in the apartment security office.<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to the duty rotation, Jisu stood on guard while Sungwoo was unpacking the baggage. Hanho checked the guidebook application occasionally when he found the second thread on the bulletin board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Urh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>[2] Survivors must read!

Come to think of it, it would be more beneficial to communicate with comments without spending 1,000 gold. This guy really donated 1,000 gold.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Like Hanho said, the author who donated 1,000 gold seemed to have no other intention.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Many people felt really burdened to write to the community using 1,000 gold. Not surprisingly, there were numerous comments below that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Comments: 24」<br/><br/><br/><br/>― 23-year-old Jinsu Kim: I hope my mom reads this. A 23-year-old student from J-University’s Department of Social Physical Education is coming up from Chongju. If you are alive, never come out and hide in the house! There are a lot of energy bars and chocolates in my room!<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>― PC Room Jonber: Brother, it’s me, Uitae. Currently I live in the Shark PC room in front of the school with my friends.

I would like to share a little piece of information for survivors. When people come together for a team play, something like ‘synergy effect’ is triggered. This is really great. So, don’t forget to move in groups!<br/><br/><br/><br/>˪ Yasuo 1: Who doesn’t know that?

You have to hide in a higher building!<br/><br/><br/><br/>˪ Yasuo 1: I’m a wolf killer. I’ve got them all. ^^<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>“It seems there are much more comments on the 4th day as people gain more gold. I think I have to change my nickname and post a comment,” said Hanho. Then he changed his nickname in the settings and started commenting immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Mom and Dad, I’m coming back home tomorrow…Done.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho posted a comment like that and closed his eyes after putting the cell phone in his pocket. He had to get enough sleep for tomorrow’s march.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo called him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Hey, Hanho!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But I think you got a strange ID.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Are you serious?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho hurriedly checked his cell phone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>― Strongest ‘Totgo’ Haho Lee: Mom and Dad, it’s me, Hanho. I’m coming home tomorrow morning. Please prepare some meat dishes for breakfast, and white rice, but rice with beans.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Ah! Dang it, it’s a typo. It should be ‘Toduk'(thief). I have to change it again!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-After changing your nickname, you can’t change it again for one year.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my, it’s driving me nuts!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good night, Togo! Don’t forget to take Jisu’s place for guard duty.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Oh, I’m so embarrassed… I shouldn’t post any comments for a year.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next morning, Sungwoo and his friends had chocolate pies and cookies for breakfast, then left the place. The air was chilly at dawn as the seasons were changing. It seemed that the whole world was becoming quieter day by day.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>They walked for about an hour. Finally, they arrived at Hanho’s neighborhood. It was an old town with closely spaced townhouses inside the one-room compound.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s be careful because there are many alleys.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As they approached the house, Hanho’s face hardened. He didn’t know what he would undergo from now on, but he couldn’t easily shake off his anxiousness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Over there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho’s finger pointed to the B compound…<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Stop.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo lowered his posture, and the other two quickly hid behind a truck parked on the side of the road. </div><h2 id="chapter33">Chapter 33</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Three orcs.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I saw them too.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu pulled out her sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo raised his head and checked them, the three orcs were resting at the entrance to the B compound.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of them was wearing a bunch of colorful clothespins as a necklace, which seemed to look cool to them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There might be more around. As this place is rather complex, you never know where they will pop out. Let me ambush them with five skeletons, so both of you take care of the rear with the other four skeletons!” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then he took out a one-handed spear that he had tied to the orc skeleton’s bag. It was an item he obtained from the H Apartments gang members.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At his order, the skeletons moved in an organized way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The three orcs, sensing human movement, raised their heads and looked over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo stabbed the spear into one of their necks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When one fell, the other two threw their bodies to escape the flying daggers and picked up the axes placed at the wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But they also fell onto the cold floor because Right circled the building and ambushed from behind. It was a perfect raid close to an assassination.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s their habit not to look back.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo always pursued the most effective battle method like this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, they were killed instantly… There’s no more human movement nearby,” said Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho hurried into the B compound. He was impatient.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The narrow corridor was unexpectedly neat and clear. As if the front doors of apartment 101 and 102 were forcibly opened, traces of the axes were clearly visible, while the thick iron gates were completely crushed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While passing by the door for a moment, the house reeked of blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho impatiently jumped up the stairs, but Sungwoo followed and stopped him by grabbing his shoulders.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, hey! Calm down. How can you walk up like that when you don’t know if the monsters will pop out over your head?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Whew! We’re almost there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho’s house was upstairs, Room 202. It was already a mess with the traces of axes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fortunately, the door was not opened, unlike the first floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a ray of hope, Hanho entered the door lock password with his trembling finger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>T-t-t-t-t-t-t-trring!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he opened the front door, it was still locked, a very good sign.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho looked into the house through the gap. And then he found someone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh? Mom! Open the door!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, a middle-aged woman opened the door. She was Hanho’s mother.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? What did you say now? Hanho is here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, Hanho’s father rushed to him. Finding them safe, Hanho breathed a sigh of relief.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, Mom. I can understand you, but I wonder why Dad didn’t draw a card when he liked playing the Go-Stop game so much. It looks like he lost his senses after playing Go-Stop a lot,” Hanho said while chewing on egg rolls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu were eating lunch served by Hanho’s mother. As the food hadn’t yet run out at Hanho’s house, they enjoyed the taste of home-cooked meals.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hmm, I don’t like the pictures on the card, so I didn’t choose it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“With his pocket full of coins, Dad went out somewhere and came back every day. By the way, the orcs smashed the front door. How did you stop them?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I sprayed F killer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…What? Pesticide?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, when your father kept spraying it through the gap, the orcs ran away.”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>It was an absurd but effective method to repel the orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even after the meal, Hanho’s mother expressed her gratitude to Sungwoo and Jisu and provided all kinds of snacks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo and Jisu, thank you so much for bringing him here. Oh, I don’t have drinks like cocoa, but I’ve green tea.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No. Thank you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Hanho quickly intervened, a bit upset.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, Mom! I also helped them. I forced my way here, knocking down all the monsters. I’m serious!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can you shut your mouth, son?”<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>Hanho’s parents said they thought that Hanho helplessly died somewhere on the street. So, they never expected that he would come back home alone after a long journey like this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The boiler is off, so it’s cold water, but it’s still coming out. So, wash and relax.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They relaxed as much as possible in Hanho’s house. They had home-cooked meals after not having them for a long time and took a shower. Jisu could finally wash her blood-stained red sweatpants. As if she felt attached to the clothes, she declined Hanho’s offer to give her another set.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no thanks. But I’m just going to wash this one and wear it. I like these sweatpants because they were not visible even with the blood stains. Whew! I feel much better because above all, I can wash my clothes.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, they couldn’t afford to stay any longer. So, the three of them sat in Hanho’s room and pondered over what to do in the future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, what do you think? It’s unreasonable to stick it out here, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s set the destination before moving. The orcs we killed at the entrance were the scouts. If there are a bunch of orcs nearby, they could launch a large scale attack on us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The problem was that they didn’t know where to go from now on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their first goal was to escape from campus, and their next goal was to get to Hanho’s house.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As they had no long-term goal, they often found themselves feeling vague about it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Hanho, who was monitoring the bulletin comments in the community, brought up a piece of news.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, look at this.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, you’re hooked on SNS, even now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo noticed him focusing on his cell phone even in classes, and rebuked him several times, but Hanho never cared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dang it, it doesn’t matter now. You know that Youngdungpo prosecutor, the guy who posted a second thread yesterday so others could post their comments freely, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yea. Why?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The man commented again. Just read it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>[3] Survivors in Youngdungpo must read! I’ve secured a safe zone!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Author: Youngdungpo prosecutor │ Views: 45,499<br/><br/><br/><br/>I’ve prepared a safety zone in Youngdungpo. There is a lot of controversy over the first thread, but I mean it. Among my colleagues, I know a guy with a three-star job card called ‘Pioneer’, and he can use his exclusive skills to turn the interior of Youngdungpo Station into a zone where monsters cannot enter. He can’t accommodate everyone, but right now he is recruiting the first members to go with him. Because it costs a lot to maintain the skill, you will receive gold or food once you enter the zone. Please understand that this is an inevitable choice for the survival of all the members.<br/><br/><br/><br/>「Comments: 45」 Again, an issue about the safety zone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can I believe it this time? This guy really looks like a good person.”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“Well, that’s why he posted a thread yesterday.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It wasn’t unconditional. This was his purpose?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It might be true that ‘Youngdungpo prosecutor’ said that he prepared a real safety zone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo also thought it was highly likely that he did so because it was definitely a game with all kinds of jobs and skills. But he thought that the man’s decision to donate 1,000 gold and create an environment where others could freely comment was not necessarily made in good faith.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Look at the comments. This guy yesterday has already gained credibility because of his thread yesterday.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>「Comments: 46」<br/><br/><br/><br/>― Dash Tanker: After all, kudos to ‘Youngdungpo prosecutor! Thank you for the really good information again! Our party has been with Puchon, but we decided to switch to Youngdungpo!<br/><br/><br/><br/>See you in person then.^^<br/><br/><br/><br/>― Two-star Monk Mr. Kim: I trust you! I will follow you!<br/><br/><br/><br/>― Heejin Yang: Youngdungpo prosecutor! What is your real occupation? Will you save us from this crazy world? I really didn’t want to use 100 gold, but let me leave a comment like this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those were the comments that Hanho showed to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“All the comments are praising the guy. In fact, there were a lot of thank-you comments on his thread yesterday. Anyway, he’s going to be popular among them.”<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter34">Chapter 34</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Well, actually he sent out the thread as a trial balloon yesterday. From now on, he can receive their gold and fool around as much as he wants from now on. It’s gonna be huge.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, no good faith without reason?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded at that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, based on this game system, people who racked their brains for profits began to appear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I can’t join because Youngdungpo is too far away from my place.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bet. Then look at this.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>― Prime middle-aged Kim: My job is a two-star ‘missionary,’ and I can make a small safe room. My location is Suwon. I am looking for a young woman to live with. Let’s decide on the place together. You can apply with your friend. Hahahaha.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>˪ Survivor 44: Ugh, uncle, how dirty.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it. This is not what I want. How about this?” Hanho showed another comment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>― Section Manager Ku: I have a safe zone in Suwon Hwaseong, too. I’m also a 3 star Pioneer. I get monthly rent. Come and contact me.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Monthly rent? Can you believe there is a landlord in this situation? How about going to this place?”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Although Sungwoo didn’t like the expression ‘landlord,’ he thought it was necessary to confirm the concept of this safe zone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Suwon Hwaseong isn’t that far, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well… I haven’t walked there before, but it took me about 20 minutes by bus.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then shall we take this as our next destination?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everyone agreed. Although everything was still uncertain, they instinctively felt attracted to the concept of ‘safety.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Until now, no matter where they spent the night, they had to take turns to stand sentry and snooze away in tension. It was quite stressful for them. Finally they found a place they could sleep without any worry! Naturally, they wanted to move there.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Okay. Let’s sleep here today and move tomorrow. Hanho, tell your parents about our plan and pack the necessary stuff.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yep.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A little later, Hanho came back after talking with his parents.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“According to my parents, it seems that there are bands of thieves around this area.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Bands of thieves? Like those guys in the H Apartments yesterday?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the collapse of the law and security, were groups like them emerging to target the survivors and not the monsters?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah. I think they look like a bunch of high school gangsters. It seems like they like to ride on motorcycles and rip off the survivors? My mom said that she saw the people next door get ripped off by these guys while they were trying to go out.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo feigned a smile. At a glance, they must be lower-class gangsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Those ignorant bastards are running around without knowing anything.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“To be honest, I’m not too worried about them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As far as the battle was concerned, Sungwoo’s party had plenty of experience by now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unless the gangsters were not stupid enough, they would not dare to appear before Sungwoo’s party escorted by skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the next morning, they really appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Purring!<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>The gangsters gathered at the entrance to the townhouse compound as if they got wind of Sungwoo’s party. There were a total of seven bikes, carrying two each. So, a total of 14 gangsters were waiting for Sungwoo and his friends to come out.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Hi, mister?” asked a high school girl behind the driver of a red bike with a silly smile. “Hey, can you give us everything you have?”<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>Then a guy with a nose ring opened his mouth, “Uhhhhh. When you’re hiding inside your house, you should just be quiet. You’ve been caught while we’re passing by this area.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He threatened them with a mace in his left hand, wielding it roughly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Give us all your weapons and gold while we’re being nice to you. We don’t want to see your blood. Ugh?”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo didn’t feel threatened at all. He laughed before he knew it and said, “You just heard it, but you didn’t see it, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the gangsters’ faces hardened quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What did you say? We didn’t see what?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, mister, don’t be relaxed like that. Don’t you see how many of us are here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>To avoid this kind of unpleasant situation, Sungwoo hid a bunch of skeletons on the stairs on the 3rd floor last night. That’s why they didn’t know anything about the skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle, rattle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, something was heard coming down the stairs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Run away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Floor the accelerator quickly! Right now!”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Even before the skeletons came out, the gangsters freaked out and began to turn their bikes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puurring! Puurring!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They literally escaped, driving the motorcycles at full speed, with the exhaust fumes filling the place. Watching them flee like that, Hanho and Jisu looked dumbfounded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then Sungwoo moaned with a distressed look, “Ugh.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What’s the matter?” Jisu asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And soon they knew why.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bull-sized, no, truck-sized wolves appeared among the abandoned cars in the parking lot on the left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘A total of three. But there may be more somewhere.’<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>Sungwoo heard people’s eyewitnesses about the huge wolves several times. Sergeant Kim warned him against them, and people consistently posted comments about them in the community.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Sungwoo had it in mind that someday he would have to face them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But no matter how hard he thought, he didn’t know how to tackle the herd of giant wolves.<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>It was dangerous to have hand-to-hand combat with the wolves at close distance. Aside from their overwhelming teeth, claws, and physical strength, the numerical balance was disadvantageous to Sungwoo and his friends.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Everyone, step back inside!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wolves’ spines were level with the ground. So, they could balance their bodies by twisting around, even if they were entangled in hand-to-hand combat. However, human spines were vertical to the ground. Once a human fell, it was very difficult for them to restore their balance. In other words, if they fall, that’s it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They slowly stepped back into the building. Of course, entering the building was not safe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the wolves were monsters with immense power, they could easily rip apart a narrow hallway, tear the windows, or knock down the walls to get inside.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The herd of wolves slowly closed in on them as if they were going to charge right away, but Sungwoo’s party moved back carefully. Soon they succeeded in hiding themselves inside the building.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Sniff, sniff.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of them at the forefront put its nose to the ground and sniffed hard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although their prey was out of sight, the wolves could sense where they were.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wolves entered a strange cave, but did not go far. While preparing to drag out their prey cornered inside the building, the wolves stuck their heads into the narrow building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, something flew toward the wolves’ heads and shattered.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>They were glass bottles with an orange juice brand logo on them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hit!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But what really mattered were the contents inside the bottles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The sticky liquid soaked their giant heads, and smoke rose with the stench in no time.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Besides, their rough hair melted like fluff and started to boil. That was the acid liquid of the Elder Slime the skeletons put in the bottles yesterday.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Frightened, the wolves scratched their faces with their paws. However, their hair and flesh that had been ruined by the acid flayed from their bodies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Throw now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, the javelins were thrown at their noses and necks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was the kind of action which bipedal animals, especially humans with straight spines, could exert far greater power than their predators. It was none other than ‘throwing.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The human skeletal structure has the ability to throw farther and more accurately than any other animal. Ancient humans used ‘javelins’ to hunt much bigger and stronger predators.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the morale of the wolves was not broken. Another wolf smashed the front door with its claws and forced its way into the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You, charge now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At Sungwoo’s order, one orc skeleton charged right at the wolf. Then the wolf bit it ruthlessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the skeleton’s ribs contained a glass bottle of slime liquid.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kek! Kek!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Frightened by the smelly liquid overflowing from its mouth, it had trouble breathing now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It began to wriggle its body and stepped back awkwardly, but something fell from the air and landed on its neck. It was Right, which jumped from the second-floor window.<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter35">Chapter 35</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Right stabbed it with the saber, and killed it even before it felt any pain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 240 gold by hunting a Dire Wolf.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Now, two wolves were left, but one of them was already covered with slime liquid.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle, rattle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Orc skeletons assaulted them out of the building. Now that their fighting spirit was broken, the wolves were easy prey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The other wolf, which emerged unscathed, charged at the skeletons while trying to protect its fellow wolf, but it was no match for them any more. A numerical advantage was a matter of proportion. A little while ago, there were four times as many skeletons as wolves, but now it was twelve times. In other words, their numbers were large enough to surround and knock down the two wolves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While one orc skeleton was smashed with its neck bitten by the wolf, the other skeleton spread itself wide and stabbed a bone spear into the wolf’s neck and body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 240 gold by hunting a Dire Wolf.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 240 gold by hunting a Dire Wolf.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 7)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whew…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo sighed with relief. Although he confronted the wolves with slime liquid, he didn’t know if this would work. What if he didn’t save the slime liquid just in case of contingencies like this? Obviously Sungwoo’s party would have been annihilated while struggling to confront the wolves in the narrow passageway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow…these guys are now the strongest in the world?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nope.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then what is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, the all-in-one desk was stronger.”<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>“Aha?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then Sungwoo chose a level up card. He also chose ‘skill’ again this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The maximum number of subordinates has increased by one (+1).<br/><br/><br/><br/>“······.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only one? There must be something off, but since he had been so lucky continuously, it was an easy fight. He even felt sorry about it. When the situation was wrapped up, Hahno calmed down his parents who were so surprised to see the skeletons, but they were not that surprised to see the skeletons either. Was it because Hanho tipped them off in advance?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“When I kept looking at them, they seemed to be cute. Look at this one especially. It’s waddling between the bigger skeletons.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho’s mother stroked the back of Right’s head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bet, Mom. But it’s the captain of the skeletons.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? Awesome. When are you going to have such a title, Hanho? You didn’t even become the leader of your classmates in elementary school.”<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>Now there was an important procedure left. Sungwoo stood in front of the body of a ‘Dire Wolf’. And he infused his will to resurrect into its body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead cannot respond to your call.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You can’t resurrect the ‘large monster’ because your level is too low.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>Sungwoo smacked his lips and felt that it was a pity. If he had resurrected this four-footed wolf, it would have been a very efficient means of transportation.<br/><br/>9<br/><br/>“Let’s get out of here quickly. There may be more around.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t guarantee a victory if they encountered a bigger pack of wolves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, they departed for the safe zone in Suwon Hwaseong.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it. They’re still sitting on the building. I wonder when they’ll fly away once and for all.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party thought they could get to Suwon Hwaseong in just a few hours. By car they could arrive there in ten minutes. But there was a variable. About 15 minutes ago…<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dudududu!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The roaring of the propellers filled the sky, then four military transport planes soon passed over them. They instinctively crouched and looked up at the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, it’s the army! The military is trying to do something…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even before Hanho said something, the soldiers in the ramp doors were seen moving hurriedly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were firing something towards the rear, and they weren’t using bullets. They were firing coarse weapons, such as crossbows and bows somewhere. And their targets soon appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crazy! Go inside the building!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and his friends hurriedly hid themselves in a nearby mall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of giant shadows were fiercely chasing the planes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wings of the monsters that appeared in the gale were the very same monsters they witnessed when escaping campus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Field boss ‘Wyvern Alphamale’ has appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were faced with the Wyverns again. They chased the planes at a furious speed and pushed their heads into the ramp doors. The soldiers were slaughtered like the helpless swarms of insects trapped in a narrow barrel.<br/><br/>7<br/><br/>Woowoong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Wyverns, like a hornet of hornets, clung onto every corner of the fuselages, tearing the windows with their claws and teeth and ruining the equipment. Eventually the transport planes lost balance.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The noise of them falling in the vicinity was heard one after another.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In no time, the roaring of the propellers disappeared completely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party was hiding at the small cell phone dealership attached to the mall, waiting for the Wyverns to fly away. But to their surprise, the predators were resting on the rooftop of a nearby building. Almost six hours had passed, but the Wyverns would not move at all. Watching some of them sleep with their long wings folded, it seemed like they were going to stay here for some time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The safe area is around the corner…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They will eventually move. We can’t break through them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Was it because flying with a heavy body consumed a lot of stamina? Their break time lasted indefinitely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly night came, and Sungwoo’s party also decided to spend the night there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And when it was past midnight, a message appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-What’s the best job to survive in the ruined world? Choose now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s started.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The second round of selections had begun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Mom and Dad! Please don’t choose one like I did. Please choose one with the most stars!” Hanho shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my God! How can you say that to your parents, son!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, another message was displayed before Sungwoo, Hanho, and Jiu who had already drawn job cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Choose a card linked to your job!<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Linked?”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Soon, the first scene Sungwoo saw in the classroom appeared. Cards of various colors were floating in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-15 seconds left!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was embarrassed at the time, but he could be prudent now.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>‘If it’s a linked card, does it have to match with my current occupation?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, one card appeared with a strange sound.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It meant that the decision process was not available to Sungwoo alone, but shared by many others.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It looked like someone had just drawn a card, and even this was a competition.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was not impatient.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If this is a connection card, choosing the one with a lot of stars may not be the right answer. What would match best with Necromancer?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He looked at the spinning cards one by one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Shield Warrior (★★)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Chivalrous Fighter (★★)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Ninja (★★★)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Paladin (★★★★)<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>-Eloquent Speaker (★★)<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>-Javelin Throw (★★★)<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>In addition, several more cards passed, spinning before his eyes one by one. But he could not find one that matched well with Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-8 seconds left!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s eyes darted quickly. At that moment, he noticed a purple card at a distance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Warlock (★★★)<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>The meaning of Warlock had been translated in a variety of ways, but in simple terms, it was a ‘black wizard.’ When it came to black magic, what was the one thing that came to mind?<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The orc chief of the gymnasium.’ Didn’t it use black magic?<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>It even sacrificed its subordinates to cast black magic, but it only ended up increasing Sungwoo’s stats. As a result, the ‘first stimulant’ worked on Sungwoo, who then slaughtered the orc chief. At that time he witnessed the black magic by default. Then, what would happen if he could make use of that technique himself?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo reached out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have selected a linked card.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Warlock (★★★)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then the following message rang.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-A new skill has been given in connection with the existing job card (Necromancer).<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Death Aura<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Basic<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Consumption: 10 per minute<br/><br/><br/><br/>*When using the skill, it releases a ‘death aura’ to strengthen the undead under your authority.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Enhancement effect is given at random. The enhanced undead throws a curse (weakness) at the enemy, causing continuous damage, and the damage increases as the number of surrounding undead increases.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought it was a good choice. </div><h2 id="chapter36">Chapter 36</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Ahhhh!” Hanho shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that Hanho regretted drawing a wrong one this time, too.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dang it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho sat down on the floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I was going to draw it, but somebody snatched it at that moment… It had four stars…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, what did you pick?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Priest…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thief and priest? They don’t match at all.”<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>“I’m done for!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, this game somehow seemed to match the skills with the existing job.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho was given a plausible skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-New skills have been issued in connection with your existing job card (Thief)<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Executor of conviction<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Basic<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Consumption: 10<br/><br/><br/><br/>*The moment you kill the enemy, you will gain a holy shield for 10 seconds.<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sungwoo turned toward Jisu. When he was going to ask her which linked card she chose, Hanho’s father suddenly cut in, “Hey, Hanho. Is this card a good one?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pioneer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, Pioneer? What a good card!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His father smiled at his reply and said, “I chose it because its drawing was pretty. Son, can you steal anything when you’re so slow like that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pioneer was the job that could help him make a safe zone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, our reason for going to Suwon Hwaseong has disappeared.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Like he said, they could make their own safe zone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jongho Lee, Hanho’s father, argued that it was all thanks to his experience with the Go-Stop games that he could draw the “Pioneer” card in a timely manner. He added that it was his worst mistake in his life that he didn’t teach his son how to play Go-Stop games early on.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“Hey, son, hands are faster than eyes! Keep in mind what I just said if you want to be the greatest thief in this country!”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Dad…I got it. Please stop. If you had not played Go-Stop games, you would not have lost the building anway. By the way, what did you choose, Mom?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I chose a cook.”<br/><br/>6<br/><br/>-Cook (★)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my goodness! Cook? Why didn’t you choose a fighting job?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bastard! How can you say that to your old mother? She has been sick and tired of setting the table for you and me. Don’t you know that!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, that’s not what I mean…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While Hanho’s family was chatting like that, Sungwoo asked Jisu which card she drew.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I chose a 3-star Hitman.”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>‘Hitman’ was something like a ‘hired assassin.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>She said when it was linked to her job, it came up with a skill called ‘Exquisite senses.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It is a passive skill, but my senses will expand in a difficult situation. I’m not sure what it is yet.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like she said, it seemed that she could check how it could really function only in battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, can you explain the skills of a Pioneer?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo asked Hanho’s father whether he could make a safety zone by using the Pioneer’s exclusive skills because the skills were key to determining their next step.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, wait a minute. Let me tell you the details.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The details of the skills were as follows:<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Pioneer Camp Creation<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Basic<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Consumption: Consumes 10 mana every 10 minutes<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>*A Pioneer can create a safety zone to avoid monster attacks. The area of ​​the zone is limited to 200 square meters and the height limited to 10 meters. The safety zone is protected by a ‘shield.’ Damaged shields are recovered in real time, but can be destroyed by powerful attacks. Gold is consumed when mana is exhausted. (100 gold deduction per 10 minutes)<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a reason why they insisted on receiving the so-called monthly “rent” with respect to their safety zones mentioned earlier on the community bulletin. The amount of mana was inadequate to maintain a safety zone, but gold could be obtained through others.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought to himself, ‘It is difficult to create and maintain a safety zone right now. Besides, it doesn’t seem to be a good option to get a lot of people who will give me gold and make a big group.’<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Then he looked out of the building quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Several Wyverns were spreading their wings to prepare for their flight in the dark.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s use the skill during emergencies. We have to find a decent place to create a safety zone.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, does it mean that we are going to the safety zone in Suwon Hwaseong?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, we don’t have to contact them. Those who can create a safety zone will try to bully other people by all means. If we meet them, I think we’ll be stressed out.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was no longer a world where people were nice to each other with good intentions. To survive, they had to bully and deceive others. Those who noticed it early on were using the community to gather their targets to exploit them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo vowed, ‘I should look at them as exclusively as possible. That is my self-defense.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just before dawn, the Wyverns took off finally.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even after they flew away, Sungwoo’s party stayed for quite some time before leaving the place. Basically, they waited until the Wyverns flew far away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho, check if there’s something like a store location in the community.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay, wait a minute.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had 24,560 gold. He needed to quickly release this gold to grow further.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“Doesn’t look like any are near here…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t long before the community on the website was activated, so it was impossible to see all the information.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, there was the loud noise of incoming bikes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puurring! Puurring!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Along with the harsh engine sound, three bikes appeared at the crossroads.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Although it was very noisy, they could not speed up because of the cars stuck on the road.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh, those bastards! Didn’t they come here yesterday?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were the same young gangsters who came in front of Hanho’s house and asked for all the gold. Looking at them for a moment, Sungwoo smiled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s ask them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are stealing other people’s gold, right? Then they most likely know the location of the shop where they are using the stolen gold, I think.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, that makes sense!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a matter of fact, the young gangsters arrived at the perfect time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The underground parking lot of an old shopping mall was lined with colorful bikes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, three more bikes arrived and parked across the street. Five men and women got off the bikes and entered the shopping mall in the corner of the underground parking lot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it. Because of the Wyverns, we had a really hard time last night. How many hours were we locked up in the butcher shop? Ugh, I’m tired.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, we got some meat, man. It is a gain.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, are you happy because you got pork belly in this situation?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>These were a bunch of teenage runaways and biker gang members who were full of antisocial attitudes. So, immediately after the game took place, they could adapt faster to the situation than any other adult because all they needed to do was double down on their misbehavior.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, Taesung, you can play the silver roulette this time, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The highest level in the pack was Taesung Han. After dropping out of high school after one week, he once acted as an amateur boxer. He luckily picked a job called “Martial Artist.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, he could easily beat monsters such as goblins with his familiar boxing techniques, and he was Level 6 now. Because of this, he earned more gold than the other boys.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>“Well, I think I can if I collect a little more. Last time I screwed up because I picked the survival package. So, I hope I can get something useful this time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While chatting like that, they went to their underground hideout.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woong ——<br/><br/><br/><br/>The electricity was still on in the spacious indoor area, but the fluorescent lights were turned off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, only the eerie lights from the stand or refrigerator were everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, guys! We are here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You thought we were dead?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, it was too quiet inside.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why is it so quiet here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Inside the corner, some light leaked from the office. However, no one could hear any voices.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Shush!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Feeling nervous, Taesung took out his knuckles and put it on his hand. Then he carefully and slowly turned the office doorknob.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haaaah.”<br/><br/>1 </div><h2 id="chapter37">Chapter 37</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Taesung breathed a sigh of relief. When he opened the office door, nine friends of his looked up at him. But the atmosphere was still heavy. It was as if they had come to a mourner’s house.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? What’s wrong with you guys?” Taesung asked, and a woman in a red hoodie among them opened her mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, that uncle is here…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taesung’s eyes widened at the word ‘uncle.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Why did he come again!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, he complained we collected too little money….then even Yujin…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What’s wrong with Yujin!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shouting like that, he strode to the door with the sign, ‘President’s Office.’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But even before he grabbed the doorknob, the door was flung open, and a woman with a haggard face appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s noisy…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She looked at him with her pupils half-closed.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“…Uh??”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, her neck was marked with sharp teeth marks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He stepped back unwittingly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yujin, you…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s noisy! Don’t open your mouth. If I smell your flesh, I’ll get hungry. I can’t stand it anymore because my head is aching!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Yujin blurted out some nonsensical words, then turned her head with a frown where there was a man sitting in the chair of the president’s office with a baseball cap on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What a nasty girl… Hey, Taesung Han! Come here, boy!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Discovering him, the man beckoned to him. Taesung clenched his fist unconsciously, but he released it and walked into the president’s office.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, Taesung.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“….Yes, sir.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why did you kill Woosuk?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woosuk Kim was the name of the leader of his gang. He was poor and uneducated, but he was always bright and loyal to his friends, so those children who were hovering depended on him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Woosuk turned into a monster after he met this man called ‘Uncle.’ After that, Woosuk was hungry for blood. That was why he was bent on seeking gold and broke his own to kill the survivors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m asking you. Why did you kill him?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was not the end of the story. Woosuk’s thirst for blood had crossed the line. Completely insane, he started to aim the necks of his friends. After all, Taesung killed him in person. The moment Woosuk attacked another friend, Taesung smashed his head from behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I had no other choice because he attacked our other friends.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, then, next time it’s Yujin’s turn to attack them. What are you going to do?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I told you, man. Holding it back too long is not good for you. If you suck blood moderately, you can maintain the status quo. Oh my god! I’m really pissed off because you guys can’t understand what I’m talking about.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Moderately? How much is that? Do you know how many Woosuk killed?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Are you now challenging me?” The man named Uncle stood up from the chair with a smile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As the chairman is expanding the business, he is going to include you guys. Do you think you can survive if you don’t listen to us? Huh? Tell me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you just leave us alone, we can take care of …”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nope, you’re wrong. If you don’t listen to us, we’re going to track you down and kill you all. Leave you alone? Are you crazy?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taesung bowed his head helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, Taesung.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Bring me 10,000 gold in two days. Otherwise, you’re the next target. Don’t waste money because the shop is right in front of you. Accumulate gold and wait. You know you can’t run away from us, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taesung did not dare to protest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, loud bangs were heard outside the door, with something breaking and falling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Huh? What the fuck is that noise??”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the door of the president’s office was opened wide. And a boy jumped in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Taesung! Somebody came in here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Uncle snorted at his urgent tone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are there customers still coming to our mart here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Not customers, but skulls!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, someone pulled the child’s shoulder and entered the president’s office. He was holding a long sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He silently looked around the president’s office, then met Uncle’s eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Making an embarrassed expression, Uncle slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sir, may I help you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the man’s lips curled up a bit and demanded, “Give me everything.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hand over everything you have. You never thought you would lose everything, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taesung stepped back, dumbfounded by what was going on right now because Uncle would immediately jump at the stranger’s neck. And this place would turn into a sea of blood…<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uhhhhh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Uncle revealed his teeth with a smile. His canines were revealed. As if he noticed Uncle’s canines, the man frowned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Those teeth…are you the guy I’ve been looking for?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…What?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I mean the ‘Boss’ of the young gangsters at the H Apartments?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Uncle’s face hardened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did you kill the children in the apartments?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, I did.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as the man finished speaking, Uncle charged at him. Suddenly his nails were sharply pointing out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the thin makeshift wall of the president’s office collapsed, and something white broke into it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The giant two-meter tall monsters charged at him instantly, holding his shoulders and arms from both sides. The man also stretched his arms from the hilt.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can you regenerate your skull too?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as he said that, the man’s blade pierced Uncle’s neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taesung couldn’t figure out what was going on, but he naturally released his clenched fists.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought that the blood-hungry vampires were lurking all over the city. According to the testimony of the young gangsters of the H Apartments, President Park, their boss, was changed into a vampire by someone. If so, it was likely that a similar situation was happening elsewhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But he never expected he would bump into the man so quickly like this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t move. I’ll smash your head!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt he needed to be coolheaded the moment he saw the man’s canines.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And he prepared for the battle instead of blackmailing the man.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In no time he had an orc skeleton stand by at the entrance so that it could jump inside right away at his order, which was very effective.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo realized from the last battle that it wasn’t enough to just cut the arms or legs to overwhelm a vampire that was very good at regenerating.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>For the average human, cutting his or her neck was the best way to kill them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you Vampire Rod?”<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>The man smiled at Sungwoo’s question, then tightened his left hand which was bound by the skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crunch!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then the orc skeleton’s shoulder was dislocated and pushed to the side. He threw his left hand at the blade at a tremendous speed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The item has been destroyed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s sword broke in half. How could he break the sword in one go?<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a terrifying situation, but Sungwoo immediately stepped back without panicking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man attacked Sungwoo head-on, with the blade stabbing toward his neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, a dagger was stabbed right into his shoulder. It was a dagger thrown by Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he lost his balance, Jisu emerged from Sungwoo’s right and wielded her saber.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the man lifted his arm to block the blade. She inflicted long cuts on his forearms, but they were not deep enough to cut through. And the wounds began to regenerate instantly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then there was a spark in his arms because he was hit by the blade that had been sharpened by the ‘ignition whetstone.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Frightened, he shook off the sparks, but Jisu attacked right away. Even without putting off the sparks, he struck back by stretching his left hand sharply.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, she quickly turned her head and brandished the saber on his left arm.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, his left wrist was cut off. But his sharp nails flew toward her abdomen at the same time. She quickly jumped back in response and avoided the attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His nails were still in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching her adroit sword skill, Taesung opened his mouth wide.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Who the hell are these people?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, Jisu’s swift action was superhuman. From his perspective as an amateur boxer, her action was really extraordinary.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And there was a message before her eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Exquisite senses are in play.<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter38">Chapter 38</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Whew…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The skill she obtained with the linked card was fully activated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, Sungwoo’s skill was also in play at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Aura of Death is awarding the effect of ‘forced slowdown’ to the subordinate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The enemy that came into contact with the subordinate has fallen into a state of ‘weakness.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Normally the orc skeleton would have collapsed without overcoming the vampire’s power, but now it had its shoulder only dislocated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, a series of warning messages appeared before the vampire’s eyes.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>-You have fallen into a state of weakness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man felt every part of his body slowly crushing as if his muscles had desiccated and his bones were being dried. He could still stand up though thanks to his extraordinary physical strength.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh…who the hell are you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You blindly charged at us, stupid. Now you want to talk to us?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was holding two spears in one hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, I want to know who you are. Tell me first.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The vampire stretched his waist as if he was not vigilant anymore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously he needed to try to buy time to recover. Then, when the wounds were healed to some extent, he apparently planned to cut Sungwoo’s neck and get out of the building to escape.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘He only controls the skeletons, but he is weak. So, I can kill him right away.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, he could not realize this kind of escape plan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A spear was thrown and stabbed into his belly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another spear pierced through his chest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But you can open your mouth even if I cut your arms and legs, right? Since we don’t even have to shake hands, you don’t need arms. Now, tell me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhh….you son of a bitch…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time his right thigh was stabbed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Watch your language, man. I’ve got lots of spears.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>In no time the floor was soaked with his blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Don’t be mistaken. You’re not superior to us just because you killed a lower vampire…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Us?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our representative won’t spare his investments, so you son of a bitch will be… Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the man’s eyes turned red, and blue veins began to bulge out of his neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was also a familiar scene for Sungwoo. After he changed into that bizarre shape, he would be running wild with his stats greatly increased. That’s what happened to President Park whom he had met at the apartments.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, kill him.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At Sungwoo’s uging, she immediately grabbed the sword with both hands and struck down his head. His head fell over a puddle of blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 332 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>And a bonus was given based on the individual’s contribution to the battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head calmly and looked at Taesung standing behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taesung’s face turned white. He stepped back awkwardly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I don’t have anything to do with that man,” Taesung said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I didn’t ask that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I told you earlier. Give me all the gold you have. You guys used to bluff me like that. Don’t you understand?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have received 984 gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have received 431 gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have received 891 gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gold was received only through physical contact such as shaking hands.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Sungwoo confiscated all the gold the young gangsters had robbed from the street survivors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, not that many. I guessed we would get at least 10,000 gold…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho grumbled while receiving his share of gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, you’ve got to take into account the fact they are low-class gangsters…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Sungwoo expected, they were merely a third-class gang with no power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But he didn’t know that they had been forced to panhandle under the vampire’s tight control.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taesung testified that the vampire called ‘Uncle,’ whom Sungwoo just killed, visited this place every day to take away gold. The vampire even tried to subdue them under his organization by making them vampires.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I wonder if the ‘Boss’ or ‘representative’ was the same man,” said Jisu, looking at the vampire’s cut head on the floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know, but this guy is deliberately and systematically expanding his power. Only a few days after this kind of thing happened, he sent out collectors to rob people of gold.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bet. I was just amazed by your swift adaptation, so I never thought there would be a man who did terrible things like this.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo tilted his head at her reaction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, these guys are not content with adapting to the situation….actually they fit well in this world.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Vampires are not just adapting themselves to new things for survival. It seemed that they were enjoying the situation, just like a person who lived in this world in the past.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“And this vampire was stronger than the one in the H Apartments. Given that he could infect directly and freely move around without any restraint, he seemed to be directly related to the main vampire.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was evident that the main vampire controlled this area, with many subordinates under his authority. Actually this ‘Uncle’ mentioned ‘us.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘But can I ignore them?’ Sungwoo murmured.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was obvious that the main vampire was tough. Even when dealing with only one vampire, Sungwoo had to use all his resources. But what if these guys attack him in a group or in a gang of dozens?<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They are clearly a potential threat.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, the main vampire was aware of Sungwoo’s movement who killed the vampire at the H Apartments. Then, he would be informed of what just happened here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thinking that someday he would confront the main vampire, Sungwoo looked at Taesung squatting in one corner. Sungwoo had to be armed with more powerful items in preparation for confronting them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo said, “I heard there was a shop here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When asked, Taesung hurriedly stood up and escorted him, “Oh, this way!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taesung walked ahead with big strides because he recognized that Sungwoo’s party was much stronger than the vampire who had controlled him and his friends.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, everyone, including Sungwoo and Taesung, had to stop at the entrance of the office, noticing the red letters before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Here’s the problem. What if you were arrogant enough not to pick up your cards even during the second round?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this? Can you see this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Sungwoo’s mind, this was not intended to cause any problems. But it was written in red font provocatively.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It is a sign of something impending.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked around the people in the office. All the members of Sungwoo’s party had already chosen their jobs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, Minsik?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The children’s eyes turned to one boy. The child called Minsik was sitting on the sofa, restless.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Minsik, didn’t you choose a job?” Taesung asked. Minsik nodded with an uneasy expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, I didn’t…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Because it’s weird! I have a bad feeling about this!”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>His action was understandable. Nobody wanted to plunge into this strange phenomenon when they didn’t know its cause. If they could stand outside safely and watch, there would be lots of people who would choose to do so.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taesung did not criticize Minsik because he had no idea of what was going to happen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The correct answer?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“W-what the fuck! What is it!” Minsik shouted anxiously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-If you haven’t yet woken up to reality after you were given two chances, you will be given the chance to become a monster if you don’t want to be a player!<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>“…What?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Minsik?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everyone stepped away from Minsik.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I wasn’t the only one who didn’t choose a card. Jaehee didn’t either!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsik pointed his finger to the boy named Jaehee. His face was flushed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A dark vein began to grow out on his face. He touched his face and soon knelt in uncontrollable pain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, Ahhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their flesh swelled, their bones thickened, and black hair began to come out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He sprouted. The height of the two boys, about 170 cm, quickly began to grow to 180, 190, and 200 cm. At first glance, they were not ordinary monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my God!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, run away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At a loss about what to do, the children started running out of the office, and the two boys who were in the process of becoming monsters screamed in pain and knocked on the walls and the floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! </div><h2 id="chapter39">Chapter 39</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The wall was crumpled like a sheet of paper when they hit it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘When they are done changing into monsters, we can’t beat them.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo instinctively sensed it. ‘But they are not done yet.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now is the time!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While Jisu and Hanho were hesitating, the skeletons jumped at their swelling bodies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the skeletons started cutting them indiscriminately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The reason they changed into monsters was because they failed to adapt to the situation. And the moment they chose to run away at this moment, their fate was decided.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“I’m sorry, but I can’t help it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two boys who were attacked while being changed into monsters counterattacked awkwardly when they were beaten by the skeletons. Losing their minds, they wielded their arms instinctively.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, their strong blow smashed one orc skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was embarrassed. Obviously their counterattack was far from adroit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They just stretched their arms not to counterattack but for defense. But the orc skeleton’s bones were thrown in all directions.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Fortunately, they were slowly collapsing. Come to think of it, even the word ‘slowly’ was ridiculous because they slowly fell even when they were stabbed with the axe dozens of times.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 3,000 gold by hunting a Werewolf.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 3000 gold by hunting a Werewolf.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 8)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What?” Sungwoo blurted it out unwittingly. 3,000 gold for each one? It was only 240 gold for one Dire Wolf.<br/><br/><br/><br/>How was it possible that the two boys were changed into such malicious monsters?<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It was a close call.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even Sungwoo felt relieved that the two boys were knocked down before they fully transformed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…This was a big deal.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, this was a happy occasion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead have become the subordinate under your authority.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead have become the subordinate under your authority.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could resurrect them as mid-sized monsters. He earned something big as a bonus, namely Werewolf skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Werewolf. Two skeletons, slightly larger than orcs, slowly straightened their backs. The thickness of their bones did not differ significantly from those of orcs. However, given the thick color or gloss shining inside their white bones, they looked much more solid.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“With this solid build, can this fight the vampire one-on-one?” Sungho murmured.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Vampires are so powerful that only when all the skeletons launch a coordinated attack, they would be killed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was the case of the lesser vampire that Sungwoo’s party confronted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Sungwoo wondered whether the Werewolves could be overwhelming enough to knock them down when he confronted them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Choose your level up card.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Stat (Random)<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Skill (Random)<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Items (Random)<br/><br/><br/><br/>4) Other (Random)<br/><br/><br/><br/>5) Increase in Physical strength by 2 (Confirmed)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sungwoo agonized over the level-up card.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was one thing that bothered him every time he encountered an enemy with excellent intellect like a vampire.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If they find out I’m the one who controls the skeletons, they’re going to kill me.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Actually, the two vampires he faced were obsessed with killing him. He could be killed with the slightest mistake. When he came across them, there was no guarantee that he could avoid them well like before. That’s why he chose the first one which was a random increase in stat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Agility has increased. (+3)<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time he got a pretty decent option. He thought that he should care about his stats sometimes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, it looks like an Egyptian god.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho seemed to be thinking of Anubis. In a way, it could look so because it had slightly dark bones like a dog’s.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the other hand, the children were in a panic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Minsik…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They could not be shocked because their two friends turned into monsters before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo passed by them and stood in front of Taesung.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Where is the store?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taesung seemed stunned by Sungwoo’s calm attitude who was looking for the store in this situation, but he nodded and said, “In fact, there is one thing I couldn’t tell you because I was absent-minded…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The nearest store is a used car dealership, but it’s been occupied by some guys. They are also obedient to the vampire… they are worse than us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As Sungwoo stared at him calmly, Taesung continued, “We just took away gold, but they catch people and donate them to the vampires.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were literally a human trafficking gang. In other words, those involved in something shitty like supplying fresh blood to vampires had already begun to appear. Left unchecked, the governing structure that could function around vampires could be here to stay.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>“What a nut! Guide me to them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had no intention of avoiding them. Since they were parasites under the vampires’ control, they needed to be smashed to check the vampires’ growth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a girl staggered to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Taesung, I’m going, too.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yujin?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at her neck where the bite marks were still visible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘She is a vampire. This is the very girl that I hear has been infected.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Vampires made one member of their target group infected so as to subject them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Where did you say you were going?” Taesung asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I mean that shop…” She looked at Taesung with blurry eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why do you want to go there?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I want blood, blood… I think I’m going to go crazy if I hold it back any longer. The vampire at the shop said he had a blood pack. I have to get the blood by citing Uncle. Otherwise…”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>What she said was very scary. ‘Going crazy’ meant that she would lose her mind and really attack humans.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taesung looked at Sungwoo with an embarrassed expression. Sungwoo frowned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a real burden to take a girl in that condition with him. Besides, it would cause big trouble if she ever ran around wildly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is it okay to take her with us?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you can’t take me, I’m not going to guide you because I can’t promise her safety.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Taesung was stubborn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure. But if she runs wildly, I’ll kill her right away. Remember that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although she was a big headache, their priority was to find a store quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyway, she was not a big threat even if she was a vampire because he obtained a Werewolf skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a member of a biker gang in this area, Taesung knew it like the back of his hand.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>It was a 20-minute walk to the car dealership, but while they were walking there, they would sometimes hear wolves howling. It was unknown whether it was the ‘Dire Wolf’ that Sungwoo saw before, or the ‘Werewolf ‘ that those who didn’t choose the cards changed into.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>However, he wished he could meet the former if he had to confront them on the way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re almost there. The shop is over there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They soon arrived at the place where hundreds of vehicles were parked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To the left of the entrance were the offices of a car dealership.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There is only one vampire in that shop?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes. It seems that there is just one vampire per group. I don’t know the details, but it looks like they can’t make vampires randomly. Ah, the other eight are regular players.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If he was right, the vampire here was not a tough opponent. However, since it was not known which job the player picked or how much combat skill he had, Sungwoo could not attack unconditionally.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s approach quietly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled the barbed wire behind the office building and quietly entered the sales compound.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Contrary to his expectations, however, the office was so noisy that he could hardly hear the noise outside. There was the sound of something breaking inside the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, is this the sound of a vampire screaming?” Hanho asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t scream like that…” Yujin replied between a sleepy and alert state.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhh! Please help me!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stopped at the noise. Hanho turned to Yujin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Do you scream like that?”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>It was a human scream. It seemed like there was a customer ahead of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo divided the skeletons and simultaneously placed them on both sides of the office building. Then he listened for the urgent voice coming from the window and inside the office.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…What! Who turned into a monster?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s because of that message from a moment ago! Fuck, he couldn’t draw a card with his hands and feet tied!”<br/><br/>3 </div><h2 id="chapter40">Chapter 40</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sungwoo understood the situation. The human sacrifice for the vampire turned into a monster.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>When Sungwoo’s party circled the building and approached the entrance, something broke through the glass door and popped out.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A man covered with blood was screaming, while a monster that looked like a Werewolf was scratching the man ruthlessly after clinging onto him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whenever the monster scratched the man with its thick claws, his flesh fell apart, turning into an unrecognizable meatball.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After slaughtering the man, the monster turned to Sungwoo. With its head that looked like a bear’s, drooling saliva and thick neck, the monster was ready to charge at him at any moment. But at that moment an arrow pierced its back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was shot from the office.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, uh? It’s useless!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaahhhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monster turned back and ran into the office. A fountain of blood poured down the window. It was a monster that ordinary players could not deal with at all. It looked like a monster that they could not hunt from the beginning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Sungwoo was different.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me help you make a friend. Go away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he tapped the Werewolf skeleton on the shoulder, a total of 10 skeletons began to enter the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle, rattle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaahhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>All sorts of screams began to come from inside the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the windows was broken, and at the same time the upper body of an orc skeleton was thrown through it. Sungwoo quietly saw the skeleton turning into ashes before disappearing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…So I have secured a spot.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since a promising candidate was to fill the void, Sungwoo had nothing to regret.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 3,500 gold by hunting a Werebear.<br/><br/>5<br/><br/>A Werebear was a monster in the shape of a bear. This too was a monster that someone who didn’t choose an occupation card turned into.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead have become your subordinate under your authority.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But now the killed Werebear was just one of Sungwoo’s subordinates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After confirming the message, Sungwoo entered the office.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The floor was a mess of glass fragments, bones and a pool of blood. And there were nine skeletons standing on top of it. A Werebear was struggling to stand up, peeling off its skin in the middle of them. It looked a head taller than the Werewolf with a thicker build.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“···”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, there were people shivering in the corner, watching the terrible scene. There were three men in total. Sungwoo opened his mouth, looking down at them, “Where’s the vampire?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You have a vampire here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They turned their heads and looked inside the office.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Khhh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man, whose right neck and shoulders were completely crushed, stood up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even if he was a vampire, he didn’t seem to have overpowered the Werebear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was what Sungwoo expected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fortunately he had good resilience, so he seemed to have survived, though paralyzed by the Werebear’s attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment Hanho called out to him, hurrying into the office.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He made a big fuss, pointing to the outside of the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Over there! Look at that bus.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A white bus was approaching when Sungwoo looked at the parking lot that Hanho pointed to.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It is our school shuttle bus… Looking at the duck doll in the driver’s seat, it must be the bus Kyongsu drove. These bastards…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had met Kyongsu Lee on campus. He suggested going to the army unit, saying he knew the route to the unit, but Sungwoo refused. He was lucky enough to stop the bus when the Wyverns were passing over them. But this time they were caught by these damned monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Huhhhh. Who the hell are you?” the vampire murmured painfully. He was clearly recovering from the wounds slowly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle, rattle—<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Sungwoo didn’t have any intention of waiting for his recovery.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Werewolf skeletons moved toward him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck are you doing now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the skeletons began to slaughter him immediately, which made the vampire’s gang squatting in the corner embarrassed and upset.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Hey, chief!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who the hell are you bastards? Why did you come here suddenly?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unlike the previous vampire’s subordinates, these guys were more swift. Although they were on the defensive, they grabbed the weapons and charged at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Right, the one-armed goblin that Sungwoo favored, moved faster than them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if they didn’t notice the goblin, they were instantly outpowered by Right.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked down at the gangsters with contempt, who fell on the floor helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Suddenly? Then did you send any pre-notice to the victims when you took them and donated them to the vampire?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned back, and Right began to kill them one by one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Along with their terrible screaming, the message about his gold acquisition appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But he ignored the message and went out to find Taesung.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taesung was supporting Yujin at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, where is the real shop?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, Just a minute.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Yujin was staggering to Sungwoo after shaking Taesung’s hands off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can I tell you one thing? When you become a damned vampire, you can feel the death of your fellow. I felt bad when Uncle was killed a little while ago. But I still feel the same.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yujin?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“These fucking vampires will rush to you in droves and kill everybody, you and all of us here… So, you have to get out of here as soon as possible!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then she turned to Taesung and continued, “That’s why Uncle came to us right after he felt that Woosuk was killed. He planted a vampire for that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If that was true, it seemed to be quite a headache for Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Confronting the group of vampires head on? That was the last thing Sungwoo wanted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, that bastard called the Boss must have grasped the situation here, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She nodded at Sungwoo’s question. Her chin line trembled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, I think so. The Boss is like a father to us because he created all the vampires. That Uncle praised him so much, that crazy asshole.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sensing that he might be inevitably entangled with the vampire, Sungwoo asked, “So, can you guys feel where that father-like guy is right now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But she shook her head from side to side and said, “Well, I also want to see what that fucking bastard looks like…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment her voice trembled even more, she began to shiver violently, which was an ominous sign.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uhhhhh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eventually, she collapsed with her wobbly legs and Taesung ran to support her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yujin, what’s wrong? Wake up!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately pulled the sword. It looked like the harbinger of her running wild.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Taesung, frightened, hugged her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shut up! Just watch out for your neck.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, fuck! No!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately had the skeletons pull him away. He struggled to get out as both hands were grabbed by them, but he had no other choice than to be dragged out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no! Don’t touch me, fuck!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You said you killed your friend who became a vampire, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taesung shut up at his question. Like Sungwoo said, he had killed Woosuk.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the situation right now was not much different from before. Sungwoo pointed it out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment Yujin whispered, with her head down, “…Don’t worry.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With her mouth curling up, she began to laugh suddenly, “Hahhhhh. This kid is fine.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What the heck was she talking about now?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yujin? What did you say?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She turned back sharply and looked at Taesung. However, even that momentary action was very eerie. She looked like a doll tied to a thread, twisting its joint.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This kid is okay, so stop it. And let him drink some blood periodically. He’s so haggard, as you can see. But not too much blood. With too little blood, this kid will be thirsty for it, but too much and he will be addicted to it. Got it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Understand? Fuck, why are you silent?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Her voice was now quite different from before. Even Sungwoo could feel it, although he had never met her before. She raised her head and looked up at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What…I can’t see him well because my vision is blurry. Is it because my skill grade is low?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, sorry, this is the skill I recently obtained, so I’m a little clumsy at using it. You can think of me as the one managing these friends anyway.” </div><h2 id="chapter41">Chapter 41</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Sungwoo frowned at that and asked, “Are you Vampire Lord?”<br/><br/>She laughed, revealing her white teeth, and said, “Oh, where did you pick up that word?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought it was time to decide on how to tackle the vampires. Dodge them or smash them?<br/><br/>‘Is she really Vampire Lord?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo felt something bad in her smile. If so, was she possessed by the Vampire Lord spirit?<br/><br/>Considering what she just said, the skill she mentioned belonged to the spirit.<br/><br/>“Oh my…my children don’t die well, but I was curious who killed them often. Fortunately, he was right next to our chief. So, I wanted to see what he looked like. But I can’t see him well.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was not sure what he looked like, but he must look disgusting to her.<br/><br/>“Damn it…you’re so talkative.”<br/><br/>“You bet. I hear that often. Anyway, you don’t like me to talk too much. So let me tell you just one thing.”<br/><br/>At that moment, she laughed, revealing her gums. Then she opened her mouth wide toward Sungwoo and vomited something out.<br/><br/>Paha! Her breath was red. Sungwoo stepped back, but the back of his hand touched her by mistake.<br/><br/>-You have been exposed to a lower curse.<br/><br/>*You need ‘divine power’ to analyze and break it.<br/><br/>Looking down at the back of his hand, he looked at her again.<br/><br/>Yujin, or Vampire Lord, was giggling.<br/><br/>“Ahhhh! You really are dead!”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“You really are dead.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“Fuck you. Let me chew your intestines. Hm? Just wait for me. Let me chop you into pieces and eat them all. Why are you silent…”<br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/>She fell to the ground, with her nose bleeding. Sungwoo kicked her hard enough to make her pass out.<br/><br/>“I didn’t have to keep listening.”<br/><br/>“Uh, but your kick was too much.”<br/><br/>As if he was shocked, Taesung blinked his eyes, looking down at her after she passed out.<br/><br/>Sungwoo touched his palm.<br/><br/>Curse? Normally, that meant that the cursed person would die slowly with terrible pain.<br/><br/>But Sungwoo experienced no such feeling. There was just a red spot on the back of his hand. Nevertheless, he was uneasy.<br/><br/>‘According to the message, I need divine power to analyze and get the antidote for the curse. But what is it and where can I get it?’<br/><br/>He could not think of anything. While he was puzzled, he felt Hanho looking at him.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I can feel something strange in your body.”<br/><br/>“…What the fuck are you talking about?”<br/><br/>Hanho began to approach him slowly. But Sungwoo stepped back, frowning at him.<br/><br/>“What’s wrong, man?”<br/><br/>“Please come to me, Sungwoo.”<br/><br/>“Me? No. Just go away!”<br/><br/>At that moment, Hanho jumped at him and grabbed his hand.<br/><br/>“Now I think I know, Sungwoo.”<br/><br/>“Are you crazy?”<br/><br/>“You have been exposed to a curse.”<br/><br/>“Uh? Ah, your job is Priest, right?”<br/><br/>Come to think of it, the job cards Hanho selected were ‘Thief’ and ‘Priest’.<br/><br/>Priest, a job that uses divine power, was right next to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“That’s right. I forgot it, too. Let me see…”<br/><br/>Holding his hand, Hanho stared into the air, trying to check a message.<br/><br/>Then he saw the contents of the curse.<br/><br/>-You have been exposed to Vampire Road’s exclusive skill: ‘Blood Tracking.’ Your location will be exposed every 12 hours.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You can’t break the curse because of low divine power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sorry, Sungwoo. As my faith is weak, I can’t heal your pain…”<br/><br/>“Shut up, man.”<br/><br/>Finding out the information about the curse itself was a big deal.<br/><br/>As a result, there was one change.<br/><br/>-Special quests are given, depending on special circumstances.<br/><br/>[List of special quests]<br/><br/>-Title: There is no country for the wicked.<br/><br/>-Condition: Eliminate the killer aiming for your life.<br/><br/>-Bonus: 30,000 gold, class C item ticket<br/><br/>*You are now somebody’s target. Your opponent is preparing all kinds of vicious operations to take your life. This bad luck will only end if either one of you dies.<br/><br/>It seemed that Sungwoo was going to be entangled with the vampire for a while.<br/><br/>He approached Taesung.<br/><br/>“Hey.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“Hey.”<br/><br/>“…Yes?”<br/><br/>Taesung, who had been absent-minded, finally looked at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Where is the store? How many times did I ask you?”<br/><br/>“Oh it’s over there…”<br/><br/>Despite what happened, Sungwoo had no other choice but to prepare to strike first.<br/><br/>And before fighting, he needed to double check his weapons.<br/><br/>He had a total of 42,950 gold. In numerous battles until now, he killed the most monsters and malicious players. He earned plenty of bonuses by hunting Werewolves and Werebears.<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party stood in front of the LCD monitor in the corner of the office. There was a green shop icon above the monitor.<br/><br/>-Welcome to the D-class shop!<br/><br/>“Uh, this is not roulette…” said Jisu while operating the computer. This store offered a drawing. A crude graphic bucket was floating on the monitor.<br/><br/>-Pick a lucky ball!<br/><br/>Bronze (100)<br/><br/>Silver (1,000)<br/><br/>Gold (10,000)<br/><br/>Platinum (100,000)<br/><br/>*Class D stores only sell up to ‘Platinum.’<br/><br/>“Oh, draw a ball?”<br/><br/>It was a game of drawing a ball from the bucket and paying for the product written on the ball.<br/><br/>“Let me do it first.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo started it first.<br/><br/>-You have one ticket now (unlimited level)<br/><br/>This time, Sungwoo also had a unlimited grade roulette ticket. It was the ticket he earned by fighting against the horde of orcs in the grand stands as a bonus for achieving 100 Kills for 100 players only.<br/><br/>‘The new platinum grade is equivalent to a whopping 100,000 gold. If so, it means that the prize will be ten times better from a higher shop than this one here. Given that the number of unlimited-grade tickets is limited to 100, it is…’ Sungwoo thought to himself.<br/><br/>So, he didn’t use the ticket because he could survive without using it for now. He chose to draw ‘Gold’ by using 10,000 gold. Soon, a platinum bucket appeared along with a low-grade 8-bit sound to accompany the mixing of the balls.<br/><br/>-You can add a ball.<br/><br/>Third Prize Ball (300)<br/><br/>Second Prize Ball (500)<br/><br/>First Prize Ball (1,000)<br/><br/>*There are 100 balls in total, and up to 5 balls can be added. (It will be replaced with a normal item winning ball.)<br/><br/>It was a new mode that didn’t exist in roulette. Namely, he could increase the probability of winning by adding a ball. There were a total of 100 balls, but he could not know how many were among those to win the 1st, 2nd or 3rd prize. However, based on the roulette board, the probability of winning the first place out of 100 balls was estimated to be one or two balls.<br/><br/>‘Given the first prize item in the previous drawing, it is beneficial to draw the first prize no matter how much I spend.’<br/><br/>He could easily find the answer when he thought about the legendary item, “The Tears of the Sea Spirit” that he obtained by winning the first prize in the gold-grade roulette.<br/><br/>The moment he earned it, he could resolve the chronic lack of mana that occurred in a Necromancer’s exhausting battle. He also used ‘The Vanguard’s Shield,’ or the rare-grade item selected as the 2nd prize, very well, but compared to the 1st prize, there was a big difference in performance.<br/><br/>-1st prize ball has been added. (+5)<br/><br/>Sungwoo used 5,000 gold to add 5 first-place balls. Nevertheless, he was more likely to pick up a potions package, but given the 1% chance of winning 10,000 gold as the primary option, it was much more beneficial to invest 5,000 gold and raise it to a 5% chance. Then he controlled the mouse, put it in the bucket, and drew a ball at random…<br/><br/>Click!<br/><br/>“Uh? Sungwoo?”<br/><br/>To his surprise, the number from the ball was ‘1’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Congratulations! You won first place!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo grasped a sheet of parchment fluttering down from the air.<br/><br/>[Item Information]<br/><br/>-Name: Coupon for acquiring ‘craftsman’ grade skills<br/><br/>-Rating: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: Consumable Items<br/><br/>-Effect: You will be randomly given one ‘vocational skill.’ The skill is set to a “craftsman” without any special training.<br/><br/>Based on Sungwoo’s experience, the skill that one could obtain when leveling up started from the ‘Basic’ level. </div><h2 id="chapter42">Chapter 42</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            He was not sure how many grades there were after that or how much it was enhanced, for he had not yet increased his grade.<br/><br/>“Use items.”<br/><br/>The parchment evaporated when he said that, then a message appeared.<br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/>-Name: Vacant Sanctuary<br/><br/>-Grade: Craftsman<br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/>-Consumption: 0<br/><br/>Create a resting place for your subordinates in the subspace. Regardless of the number and mass, you can let them stay there and summon them to your current location at will. (However, this only applies to subordinates in an unbroken state)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fellblade: When summoning a large number of subordinates at once, you will spread the curse of death throughout the whole area. The range and effectiveness will increase as the number increases. (Cooldown: 1 hour)<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first glance, it seemed to be okay. Until now he took it to be natural to carry a group of skeletons with him, but there were lots of things he had to care about. For example, hiding them or letting them pass through a small area was a big headache. Besides, he had to explain the skeletons whenever he bumped into the survivors.<br/><br/>Now he could put these giant skeletons in the inventory and summon them at any time. This was true innovation.<br/><br/>‘Stay.’<br/><br/>When Sungwoo recited it deep down, the skeletons became powder and disappeared into thin air.<br/><br/>-All your subordinates are now in the ‘Vacant Sanctuary.’<br/><br/>“Uh? Where are the skeletons?” Hanho asked.<br/><br/>“It’s a new skill.”<br/><br/>Afterwards, Sungwoo thought of using the additional skill called ‘Fellblade’ but refrained from doing so because it could damage other survivors.<br/><br/>Then Hanho drew the ball and earned ‘Tough Bullskin Chest Protector’ as a ‘normal item’.<br/><br/>Jisu wasn’t lucky either, but she picked a “Class B survival package” that contained bandages, first aid, ropes, and lanterns.<br/><br/>“Well, these items might be useful someday,” she said, feeling bitter about her selection.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, don’t you think you have taken away all our good luck? Let me start first next time.”<br/><br/>“Sure.”<br/><br/>They decided to save the gold after spinning the roulette by taking turns, for they knew the location of the shop and that gold was not only used in stores because it was also used to maintain a safety zone. So, they wanted to prepare for an unexpected situation by saving gold.<br/><br/>“Now, let’s go.”<br/><br/>After he was done preparing, Sungwoo climbed the stairs.<br/><br/>Sometimes a situation called for you to confront the opponent with your eyes wide open. That was what would happen to him soon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kyungsoo Lee regretted every moment.<br/><br/>‘Why did it go wrong? Instead of driving the bus out of school, should I have stayed with that man called Sungwoo Yu? I think I should have. I was too complacent.’<br/><br/>His idea that the military would be safe screwed up everything. When he finally arrived at the army unit after avoiding the horrible horde of Wyverns and passing through various monsters, it was empty. He loved zombie apocalypse movies, but when it actually happened to him, he was repeating the same mistakes that the main characters in the movies made.<br/><br/>“Damn it.”<br/><br/>All the students, including Kyongsu, were frustrated. After stopping the bus in front of the unit’s barbed wire, Kyongsu sat there quietly with his head on the steering wheel. Everything was hopeless.<br/><br/>At that moment, his friend showed his mobile phone and said, “Kyongsu, look at this!”<br/><br/>Fortunately, he discovered the QR code for the “Player Guidebook” application, and he gave Kyongsu various tips on how he contacted the community there. And what he brought this time made Kyungsu’s heart pound.<br/><br/>“Uh? Safety Zone?”<br/><br/>“Yes, it’s not far from here! Suwon Hwaseong. You have enough gas to get there?”<br/><br/>“I think so.”<br/><br/>Kyungsu began to have hope again. Then he firmly grabbed the steering wheel of the bus.<br/><br/>Indeed, all thirty students on the bus decided to follow his decision. He felt like he had great responsibility. Actually, they followed him because they believed he knew how to drive the bus and knew the way to the army unit.<br/><br/>“Good. Let’s get going again.”<br/><br/>So, he had a more sense of a mission. Thus, he drove the bus slowly and carefully. It was a very dangerous journey, but fortunately they could arrive without any accidents. He felt he was so lucky throughout the journey.<br/><br/>“Hey, we’re almost there. Just leave a comment!”<br/><br/>“Okay. Let me write it right now.”<br/><br/>But what they met there were not the saviors like Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Hey, walk straight.”<br/><br/>When he heard a threatening voice from behind, Kyongsu realized the reality and raised his head. And he walked with a heavy heart.<br/><br/>“Why? Tired? If you don’t like it, tell me. You can go into the kitchen a little sooner.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>The “kitchen” that the voice said wasn’t the kitchen for making food or washing dishes.<br/><br/>It referred to a meal made in the kitchen itself.<br/><br/>“Uhhhhhh! This bastard has no flesh that I can eat.”<br/><br/>These crazy men were the monsters that attracted people to have them serve as slaves or suck their blood.<br/><br/>In fact, Kyongsu and the thirty students came running here for their safety, but they unfortunately took the bait. And now they were slaves. They were ‘combat slaves’ who risked their lives to hunt monsters and then had all their gold taken away.<br/><br/>“Hey, these boys in my unit are getting haggard. Shouldn’t we be asking to replace them?”<br/><br/>“You bet. Besides, some of them might rebel because they have leveled up a bit.”<br/><br/>Kyongsu and four slaves could not dare to resist despite such terrible words, for they saw their friends killed brutally after failed resistance. The only thing Kyongsu could do right now was walk with his head down.<br/><br/>“Argh…”<br/><br/>At that moment, Kyongsu bumped into the back of the person ahead of him because those at the forefront stopped.<br/><br/>Crackle, crackle.<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is this that?”<br/><br/>“Bones? They look like goblins at first glance.”<br/><br/>Kyongsu slowly raised his head. Something white and small was blocking them.<br/><br/>“Aren’t they a new monster? Just kill them!”<br/><br/>But Kyongsu doubted his eyes.<br/><br/>“Hey, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/>“What? What did he say? Sungwoo? Who is he?”<br/><br/>It was natural that he blurted out loud, because the white thing he saw was clearly the goblin skeletons that Sungwoo took with him. Then Sungwoo walked out of the alley on the left.<br/><br/>“Kyongsu, it looks like the luck you borrowed from me last time didn’t help much.”<br/><br/>As soon as he said that, the skeletons began popping out from everywhere.<br/><br/>Kyongsu was puzzled at the moment.<br/><br/>Sungwoo Yu. He acted as if he had calculated everything in advance. From day one when the world turned into a game, he mounted a critical attack coldly and in a calculated manner.<br/><br/>How was it possible? Wasn’t he an ordinary college student? Even now his observations were sharp. How could he locate and target the most dangerous vampire out of the five members here?<br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/>Even before he introduced himself, Sungwoo threw four javelins at the vampire, stabbing his body here and there. It was so quick that the vampire could not respond.<br/><br/>“Ugh! Who the hell… Ahhhhh!”<br/><br/>Then, the skeletons with beast heads appeared and ripped apart the vampire, which Kyongsu and his friends could not bear to watch. But the vampire could regenerate unless he was smashed to pieces, so there was no other choice.<br/><br/>“Leave only one alive.”<br/><br/>After killing the members all at once, Sungwoo freed Kyongsu and the other slaves.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, that pervert Vampire Lord must have sensed our presence here, right? Don’t you think he is coming here soon?”<br/><br/>“I hear he is not around.”<br/><br/>The vampire allegedly could feel the death of his kind. Then, it was not difficult to guess that Sungwoo was responsible for his fellow vampires’ sudden deaths.<br/><br/>However, according to Taesung’s testimony, there was no Vampire Road in the area.<br/><br/>And he said that the “abandoned factory,” the center of human trafficking, which Sungwoo and his party would attack, was under the vampire controlled by Vampire Road.<br/><br/>“Thanks for your help again, Sungwoo,” said Kyongsu. He was almost exhausted.<br/><br/>“What happened?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/>“…I am ashamed to tell you.”<br/><br/>He said he went to the Suwon Hwaseong Safety Zone as posted in the community. </div><h2 id="chapter43">Chapter 43</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            But those who waited for them were part of a human trafficking gang in a used car trading complex. They kidnapped Kyongsu’s party on the bus and literally delivered them to the ‘abandoned factory.’<br/><br/>“All kinds of wicked and terrible things are happening there right now. Not only exploitation, but also rape, cannibalism…I really can’t believe my ears…Even though the world is crazy, is it possible for them to get involved in such heinous deeds after only a few days?”<br/><br/>“I understand,” Sungwoo nodded.<br/><br/>“But they did not become crazy like that in a day. These crazy guys were just hiding in society.”<br/><br/>Adaptation and liberation were different. In that respect, they had now been liberated.<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at the only member he didn’t kill. It was a young man in his early twenties, he was standing there, terrified.<br/><br/>“Now, I’ll give you a chance to survive. You see that dog over there, right?”<br/><br/>The ‘dog’ that Sungwoo pointed to was actually a Werewolf skeleton.<br/><br/>Crackle!<br/><br/>When the skeleton gnashed its teeth hard, the young member’s face became even more pale. Shuddering with fear, he kept nodding, saying, “Well, let me tell you everything!”<br/><br/>“Good. How many people are in the factory? Tell me how many vampires, how many players, and what level they are.”<br/><br/>“There are four vampires, but one just died here, and twelve players! There is one that’s Level 5, and Level 4….”<br/><br/>“Tell me only the highest level guy.”<br/><br/>Swallowing, he replied, “Ah, as far as I know, Level 5 is the highest…”<br/><br/>Aside from that, Sungwoo asked him other things, such as how to enter the abandoned factory and the status of security around it, etc.<br/><br/>“It’s good that you are answering truthfully.”<br/><br/>“Thank you!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo said that, then turned his head when he heard a noise.<br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>Kyongsu jumped at the young member and stabbed his neck with a javelin.<br/><br/>“Haaaa…”<br/><br/>Gasping for breath, Kyongsu stepped back and said, “You shouldn’t keep that son of a bitch alive. That bastard killed my friend…”<br/><br/>“Good job,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Anyway he didn’t intend to keep him alive either.<br/><br/>He placed his hand on Kyongsu’s shoulder. Then Kyongsu’s expression changed subtly. Beyond anger, embarrassment, and self-reproach, he felt a sense of stability he had never felt before.<br/><br/>“Kyongsu, I think you know something about the situation of the abandoned factory. Any useful tips?”<br/><br/>Kyungsoo caught his breath and said, “Security is more tight than you think. They want tight security to stop the monsters from approaching, so they have security guards everywhere. I don’t think I can break through it because they even installed barbed wires on the stone wall.”<br/><br/>Kyongsu seemed to think that attacking the factory was not reasonable, given its tight security.<br/><br/>In fact, Kyongsu and his friends had been living like slaves, taken as hostages, until they were finally freed by Sungwoo.<br/><br/>After pondering over the matter, Sungwoo raised his head and looked around.<br/><br/>“I’ve got a plan.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The site of the abandoned factory was quite large. It was a manufacturing factory that made industrial products a long time ago, but later used as a warehouse after the company went bankrupt. Since then, it has since been empty.<br/><br/>The group of vampires, who were neighbors originally, used the large, closed space as their hideout. They were planning to fortify this place by collecting useful items, food, and fuel in five days. And filling the bases of vampires all over the map was also the order of their boss, “Vampire Road,” aka “Representative.”<br/><br/>“Branch manager, I’ve conveyed the message that they have to watch out for any outside intruders. But is it true that team manager Park was killed?”<br/><br/>“Yes. I felt it, and the Representative mentioned it to me directly. Given that his mental connection with me consumes a lot of ‘blood,’ I think it’s certain Park was killed.”<br/><br/>The man, called the “branch manager,” standing on an iron railing on the second floor of the factory, looked down at the building.<br/><br/>This place suddenly bustled with all kinds of things and monster bodies. Even ‘humans’ were mixed among the items. Survivors were absolutely necessary EXP and food to strengthen the vampire’s stats, and the Representative instructed them to focus on ‘kidnapping humans’ as their main business.<br/><br/>“Branch manager, I wonder what the Representative thinks about it…How long should we keep kidnapping humans like this?”<br/><br/>Quite a few number of members had the same question. They pledged allegiance to this group for their immediate survival, but in fact, they weren’t certain about what to do next and other things. Even the branch manager also did not know the Representative’s exact purpose and why he placed his managers and strongholds in this way.<br/><br/>But he believed the Representative, and said, “This is a survival competition and an evolutionary business. We should be the leader in this field. I believe in his insights. He has a philosophy.”<br/><br/>Actually, he didn’t know much about philosophy, but he felt that way anyway.<br/><br/>In his mind, the Representative was a handsome and mysterious person. Indeed, the Representative was also his savior who changed his low status overnight as he had been working at the factory and logistics warehouse.<br/><br/>At that moment, the factory’s massive gate opened and strange people came in.<br/><br/>Two security guards appeared, dragging a young man.<br/><br/>“Branch manager!”<br/><br/>The security guard pushed the back of the man with his hands tied.<br/><br/>“Like you said, I’ve caught this intruder. He was peeking inside the factory at the entrance.”<br/><br/>The man already caught?<br/><br/>It was true that the branch manager told his men to be alert because the man who had murdered “team leader Park” who went hunting could intrude the factory. So how is it possible that the murderer was caught so easily?<br/><br/>“Oh my…It looks like the Representative’s worry was groundless.”<br/><br/>The branch manager laughed uncontrollably. He looked down at the intruder who was dragged down the railing. He was an ordinary young man. But, strangely enough, he looked relaxed.<br/><br/>Rather than looking at him, the young man was absent-minded, looking around the factory as if he were here on a field trip.<br/><br/>“Hey!”<br/><br/>Only after the branch manager shouted at him for a few seconds did the man raise his head. The branch manager felt embarrassed rather than upset.<br/><br/>“Who are you? Huh? Did you kill team leader Park?”<br/><br/>The young man tilted his head at that question and said, “Team leader Park?”<br/><br/>“Yes, team leader Park.”<br/><br/>Then the young man burst into laughter. It sounded like he was mocking them.<br/><br/>“Was the dead man wearing a business card on his forehead?”<br/><br/>“What the heck?”<br/><br/>“How would I know if you ask me about the title that only you guys know? I know you condescending guys are doing obscure business. Then, what’s your title?”<br/><br/>“…I’m a branch manager!”<br/><br/>The young man laughed again and asked back, “Branch manager of what?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“Damn it, you must be a branch manager in your own imagination, right?”<br/><br/>When this conversation was going on, the atmosphere of the factory was heavy and cold.<br/><br/>The other gang members were checking the branch manager’s expression, at a loss about what to do. But the branch manager, with veins standing out on his temple, was gnashing his teeth in anger.<br/><br/>“I asked you who you are…”<br/><br/>But the young man laughed once again and asked, “Didn’t you get a call from your Representative?”<br/><br/>The Representative’s warning that Park’s murderer would invade the factory was correct.<br/><br/>But the branch manager would have never expected this kind of intrusion.<br/><br/>In the meantime, whispering began to spread among the people taken hostage in the factory.<br/><br/>“You know that man, right?”<br/><br/>“Yes, I remember. He’s the man I saw on campus.”<br/><br/>“Why? Who is he?”<br/><br/>“He was the one who saved us all on campus.”<br/><br/>As the voices of those who recognized the man began to spread, the branch manager felt something strange.<br/><br/>“Shut up! Hey, make them shut their mouths.”<br/><br/>Then the branch manager started to descend the iron staircase grudgingly, and faced the young man.<br/><br/>“So, you’ve decided to intrude this place directly?”<br/><br/>“Well, I have been escorted here.”<br/><br/>The branch manager turned his eyes and looked at his arms. Obviously, his arms were completely bound behind his back.<br/><br/>  </div><h2 id="chapter44">Chapter 44</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “What the fuck are you talking about? Are you kidding me? Okay, let’s say you’ve intruded this place. What are you going to do alone here? Huh?”<br/><br/>The branch manager felt keenly that in this world that changed like a game, he could do nothing alone. That’s why he blindly trusted the man called the Representative. The Representative was a leader who led the group with an absolute hand forged with the oath of blood.<br/><br/>But the young man was still smiling. Why?<br/><br/>The young man opened his mouth, “I liked being alone.”<br/><br/>“What, what the heck is this?”<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>And a red warning message appeared before the branch manager’s eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Caution! “Fellblade” is now in your area!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, black smoke exploded and filled the inside of the factory.<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>Screams of death broke out from everywhere.<br/><br/>-You have been possessed by the curse of death. Your stats are greatly reduced.<br/><br/>At that moment there was something behind the black smoke.<br/><br/>“What a cool skill!”<br/><br/>They were none other than the white demons that appeared all of a sudden.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fellblade, the sub-effect of ‘Vacant Sanctuary,’ was a skill that spread curses to the affected area when a large number of subordinates were summoned all at once.<br/><br/>As it turned out, the “triggering condition” of the skill was to summon at least ten subordinates. As a result, the black smoke was enough to fill the small factory, and skeletons began to take shape everywhere.<br/><br/>“Cough! Cough! Argh!”<br/><br/>“Block them!”<br/><br/>As the skill grade of Fellblade was low, the black smoke quickly dissipated. However, the branch manager’s momentary embarrassment was enough for Sungwoo to use his fatal weakness.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhh!”<br/><br/>Screams were heard everywhere. And along with the screams, the sound of creepy bones clanking against each other rang.<br/><br/>Rattle, rattle…<br/><br/>“Wake up! They’re all scarecrows anyway! All you have to do is kill the bastard controlling them.”<br/><br/>The branch manager shouted at his men hanging from the railing on the second floor.<br/><br/>The moment the smoke spread, he jumped and grabbed the railing. He had something to trust. He thought that the three vampires, including himself, were powerful enough to overpower ordinary monsters and players incomparably. Therefore, they could kill a ‘rat’ like Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“That bastard!”<br/><br/>Then he found a man in the scattering smoke massaging his wrists after releasing the rope, namely Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Crackle!<br/><br/>Next to him was Right, the goblin skeleton. Right broke the rope around his hands.<br/><br/>“Kill that bastard first!”<br/><br/>The branch manager yelled, but nobody followed his direction. In fact, they couldn’t.<br/><br/>Bang! Clang!<br/><br/>They were already struggling to beat their opponents that were everywhere.<br/><br/>“They’re coming from there, too!”<br/><br/>“Damn, tell the security guards outside to come in!”<br/><br/>Ordinary players barely could confront the orc skeletons. However, if they had the misfortune of confronting the Werebear skeleton…<br/><br/>The vampires tore apart the orc skeletons without any difficulty, but the situation didn’t get better.<br/><br/>“What the heck! They are being resurrected!”<br/><br/>-The dead has become your subordinate under your authority.<br/><br/>They now faced the strange phenomenon of the monsters’ bodies piled up in the factory, reviving. The corpses they collected to get meat, bones, and leather after dissecting them revived and walked toward them with glittering red eyes. They were now shuddering with fear.<br/><br/>The branch manager stared at Sungwoo, gnashing his teeth because he realized that there were no subordinates to help him.<br/><br/>“Hey, branch manager? When the branch here disappears, what title are you going to use?”<br/><br/>His face turned red at Sungwoo’s provocative question.<br/><br/>Eventually, he couldn’t stand it anymore and charged at Sungwoo, kicking the railing. But Sungwoo stepped back and disappeared into the thin smoke. The branch manager, checking his movements, quickly landed on the ground and chased him.<br/><br/>At that moment, however, something flew toward his face.<br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/>The object was broken to pieces with a dull sound. And the liquid in it was splashed over his face.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>The branch manager held his face and stepped back. It was also ‘slime liquid.’ The tremendous amount of acid melted his hair and skin.<br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/>Then, while he was groaning with pain, a spear made of bones flew and struck his left shoulder.<br/><br/>Rattle, rattle.<br/><br/>After that, Right charged at him. Although he hurriedly pulled out a kukri knife, he slipped while his knife clashed against the other party’s sword. This time again, the synergy of the “One-armed Warrior” Right was triggered.<br/><br/>Its saber cut deeply through his right thigh.<br/><br/>The branch manager, covered with wounds, gasped for breath and stared at Sungwoo and Right. In addition to the apparent damage he took, his whole body was contaminated with all kinds of curses.<br/><br/>-‘Curse of death’ reduced stats.<br/><br/>-Contaminated by ‘Devil’s blood,’ his health will continue to decrease.<br/><br/>Not only the curse of Fellblade, but also the ‘Devil’s Bloodstone’ that Sungwoo obtained by killing the chief orc was taking effect. It was a terrible weapon that burned the mana of the opponent and consumed his health until there was no mana left.<br/><br/>And vampires had no mana in the first place due to the characteristics of the vampire clan.<br/><br/>So this item was the natural enemy of the vampires, which Sungwoo didn’t realize at all.<br/><br/>But that was not the end.<br/><br/>“Maybe I should use this skill too. It’s been a while.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo activated the red bracelet on his right wrist.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wild Madness has been triggered!<br/><br/>Increases attack power (+10%) and attack speed (+20%) against ‘goblin-type’ mercenaries for 10 minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a useful item that Sungwoo used when carrying a large number of goblin skeletons, but now the target of its application was only Right. However, Right always did its share faithfully.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The results of the fighting between those with huge buffs and their opponents with huge debuffs were obvious. Sungwoo and Right gradually closed in after surrounding him.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the factory door opened and six security guards entered. Hearing that their members inside were knocked down, they came in a hurry.<br/><br/>However, the first thing they saw was a 2 meter 50 cm black skeleton holding their colleague’s cut arms and legs.<br/><br/>“Uh…”<br/><br/>They had no other choice but to stop at the entrance. However, that was their mistake. They had to turn back and run away because the Werebear skeleton and beasts made of bones rushed at them.<br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/>Their lower bodies were crushed by their kicks, and their smashed shoulders bounced off the concrete floor.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a bus was rushing toward the factory that turned into a mess.<br/><br/>Bang! Screech!<br/><br/>The bus trampled down the gate and entered the factory. Then, the bus braked shortly afterwards, and Jisu, Hanho, and Kyongsu came out of the bus.<br/><br/>“Over there!”<br/><br/>They ran straight and freed the detained hostages. Meanwhile, Hanho’s parents threw the bone weapons that Sungwoo had made out of the bus windows.<br/><br/>“Move! If you get hurt, get on the bus right away!”<br/><br/>“Kyongsu, I can fight!”<br/><br/>“Okay, take the weapon.”<br/><br/>All this was taking place according to Sungwoo’s planned operation. Namely, he would enter the factory alone to confuse the vampire and his gang members inside through Fellblade, then save the survivors by attacking them. The instant the survivors grabbed the weapons, Sungwoo’s allies would be now superior to them numerically. Now, it was certain that Sungwoo’s party would prevail.<br/><br/>The branch manager looked around and could not hide his embarrassment. All the people he had kidnapped were released, and his subordinates fell to the ground without any exception.<br/><br/>Looking at him, Sungwoo laughed and ridiculed him by saying, “Oh my God! Your branch has really disappeared!”<br/><br/>How did he, faced with defeat and death, feel humiliated by the opponent? The branch manager felt an indescribable anger. And something wiggling deep inside beyond his control began to dominate his whole body. At that moment, a familiar voice was heard in his ears.<br/><br/>‘What the heck? That guy is a bit strong. Let me give you my power. Kill him by all means.”<br/><br/>It was a sweet voice.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>He vomited out blood. Then he couldn’t even scream at the pain of his whole body twisting hard. His shoulder bones broke through the flesh, while his skull tore his melted face and came out.<br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/>“Man, he was not a human!” </div><h2 id="chapter45">Chapter 45</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Hearing the freed survivors whispering, Sungwoo watched the branch manager changing bizarrely. Then, he summoned the skeletons around him because he sensed an unusual threat.<br/><br/>The branch manager’s body was swollen with a blackish brown color, and sharp bones protruded from all over the body. His arms looked like huge weapons. His face was also twisted in a weird way, so it felt more like a monster’s than a human’s.<br/><br/>“…Are you now showing your true colors?”<br/><br/>The vampires in movies were human, but during the climax, they usually appeared as monsters. Did this game follow that cliché<br/><br/>-The high-level vampire is on a rampage.<br/><br/>As if the branch manager’s huge change was a big threat, even a warning message appeared before their eyes.<br/><br/>“Kaaaaah!”<br/><br/>Yelling, he charged at Sungwoo. He hit the ground once and narrowed the distance with Sungwoo by a few meters. He displayed incredible resilience. But the orc skeleton stood before him while Sungwoo turned to the right.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The orc skeleton collapsed like a Lego block when hit by the branch manager’s superhuman force. Now, blood was simmering in every corner of his body where the bones jutted out.<br/><br/>Wherever his bloody body passed a pool of blood would be left behind.<br/><br/>‘He can’t sustain that condition for long.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo ran behind another orc skeleton. The vampire turned sharply as if he seemed to aim at Sungwoo alone, swinging his arms once again.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The orc skeleton was smashed into pieces as if it could serve as a tank.<br/><br/>‘He’s not going to sustain for long, but I can get hurt.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo controlled the fast-moving Werewolf skeleton so it could chase him closely.<br/><br/>Soon, two skeletons surrounded the branch manager.<br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/>However, the Werewolf, hit by his left hand, bounced off the factory wall. Fortunately, it wasn’t smashed, but it left a big impact when thrown against the wall.<br/><br/>‘Throwing the Werewolf?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo became curious at this point.<br/><br/>‘How many stars does Vampire Road have?’<br/><br/>While struggling with the other Werewolf skeleton, the branch manager grabbed and lifted its pelvic bone, then threw it towards the Werebear skeleton charging at him from the opposite side.<br/><br/>The two skeletons fell on the floor, entangled with each other.<br/><br/>“Kaaaah!”<br/><br/>He steadfastly aimed at Sungwoo. But Sungwoo widened the distance by blocking him while sacrificing the orc skeletons. Soon the monster bodies piled up on one side of the warehouse gradually began to shrink. The monster bodies that Sungwoo could use were running out even before his mana.<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo noticed black fur that protruded between the bodies of the orcs and goblins.<br/><br/>‘No way!’<br/><br/>The body with arrows stuck all over it like a hedgehog was a Werewolf. It seemed that the gang members managed to kill it with all their might.<br/><br/>-The dead has become your subordinate under your authority.<br/><br/>Now the dead Werewolf was placed under Sungwoo’s authority.<br/><br/>-‘Synergy’ effect is now available due to team play.<br/><br/>[Synergy list]<br/><br/>Hell’s Watchman Cerberus<br/> -Category: Clan Synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: Dog and three more creatures<br/><br/>-Effect: Attack speed increase (+10%), muscle strength increase (+10%), muscle strength increase when attacking one enemy at the same time (+50%), defense increase when blocking the ‘narrow passage’ (+50%)<br/><br/>Cerberus synergy because of three dog heads? This synergy was very mysterious.<br/><br/>‘In any case, it is great synergy. By the way, doesn’t muscle strength increase because of bones with no flesh?’ Sungwoo thought to himself.<br/><br/>He had some questions, but its effect was fantastic. The skeletons thrown by the vampire resurrected and jumped at him from three directions at the same time, and the situation was completely overturned.<br/><br/>They were no longer outpowered by the branch manager. Of course, they could do so because the three skeletons grabbed him at the same time. Then, as soon as the Werebear skeleton joined them, he was forced onto his knees.<br/><br/>Crushed by the four beasts, he screamed in pain. But that was it.<br/><br/>Soon, the orc skeletons everywhere stabbed sharp weapons all over his body. And, like he normally did, Sungwoo also stabbed the man’s neck with the sharp sword.<br/><br/>“Tell the Representative that his waseong business has been closed.”<br/><br/>-You have earned 10,000 gold by killing a special player.<br/><br/>His eyes were closed even before Sungwoo beheaded him. The wounds were so deep that he could not overcome the excessive bleeding.<br/><br/>‘What if I make his body a skeleton?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo had never tried to resurrect a human body into a skeleton. Orc skeletons were much better than human bones, so he didn’t feel the need to use human bones. Vampires were much more powerful than orcs, but they were so good at regenerating, so Sungwoo cut their heads first to kill them on the spot. And he could not resurrect the damaged bones into skeletons. So, Sungwoo secured the body of a killed vampire with his head intact.<br/><br/>-The dead has become your subordinate under your authority.<br/><br/>A vampire skeleton with a deformed bone structure raised its body. It didn’t have a big build, but its protruding shoulders and forearms were quite intimidating.<br/><br/>-You can check the ‘memory fragments’ of the dead.<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t notice it because he had never resurrected a dead man, but this seemed to be under the Necromancer’s authority too.<br/><br/>‘I think I can use this a lot in the future.’<br/><br/>A video that looked like a “memory fragment” began to play before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was part of the branch manager’s memories.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The place was a beer house. Given that it was a mess and strewn with blood, it all happened after the game began. A total of four men and women sat with macaroni and draft beer in front of them.<br/><br/>“Yeah…there can be no such guy.”<br/><br/>Among the four, one person was drinking draft beer. He was a man with glasses sitting at the top. He continued talking, chewing macaroni.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He put his hand on branch manager Kim’s shoulder.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter46">Chapter 46</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            You are now facing a massacre. In fact, the massacre in this world may not be an unusual event because it can happen frequently in the future. But it’s different to you. As a holy man with the reins of death, you can save countless lives or use those who died because of neglect.<br/><br/>The choice is yours.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your choice will affect your ‘fate.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Exclusive quest. It was the second time encountering it. He had the first one when he witnessed the death of the professor on campus. He felt like he was standing before something like a great tide.<br/><br/>“Massacre…”<br/><br/>The Vampire Lord’s quest and Sungwoo’s quest. Were their quests juxtaposed to each other?<br/><br/>It seemed that their fight was going to grow bigger and bigger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo told only Jisu and Hanho about what he saw through the video from the memory fragments.<br/><br/>“What? Were all of them brainwashed before we got here? That’s why these guys ran around all over the place and organized a thug group.”<br/><br/>In the branch manager’s memories, the expressions of the executive-level vampires who sat at the table inside the beer house were really terrible. Each of them was looking at the Vampire Lord as if they were in love with him. They yearned for him and trusted him blindly. It seemed that his magic power to tempt his subordinates strongly was one of his unique talents.<br/><br/>“The closer anyone is to the Vampire Lord, the more severe the symptoms are. Yujin, the low-level vampire, had a lingering hatred of him.”<br/><br/>“Then don’t you think that there is going to be a massive massacre in Suwon Hwaseong?” Jisu asked. She took the massacre seriously.<br/><br/>In fact, the vampires were preparing for a “Great Feast,” an operation that would lure as many survivors in Hwaseong as possible and eat them all at once. Of course, a lot of people were dying there at this moment, but Jisu felt differently this time because the massacre had been planned by the vampires in advance.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, it’s real. It’s all about luring the survivors on the community bulletin. Lots of posts are coming up, so it seems they are luring the survivors deliberately.”<br/><br/>Hanho showed Sungwoo his cell phone.<br/><br/>[8] Suwon Hwaseong Safety Zone Policy Change: Anyone, please come!<br/><br/>-Author: Manager Ku │ Views: 77,589<br/><br/>We said you would receive gold at first, but we changed the policy as a result of our internal meeting. From now on, we’ll embrace all survivors. We are a large group with two ‘Pironeers’ with three stars and three ‘Missionaries’ with three stars. Our place is very spacious, and we have plenty of gold since we have a lot of hunting teams. Of course, with the patronage of the survivors, we can build a stronger Safety Zone. So far, neither the government nor the military have saved us. We are looking for ways to overcome this catastrophe with the help of lots of survivor groups. Let’s join hands!<br/><br/>「Comments: 115」<br/><br/>Most of the comments were about things like how to find the place or they were now on the way.<br/><br/>Obviously lots of survivors already took the bait.<br/><br/>“Oh my God! They really are damned little shits. How can they be so shameless? Are they really humans?” Jisu fumed.<br/><br/>“Why don’t we post a comment saying that they are vampires who lure innocent survivors to suck their blood?” demanded Hanho.<br/><br/>Sungwoo agonized over Hanho’s suggestion. Even if he exposed a scary but unverified plot, it would only be treated as a groundless rumor. But it wasn’t a good option not to use the function of the community bulletin that could be used as a major weapon.<br/><br/>“Let’s think about it carefully before posting it,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Hanho stamped his feet as if he felt so annoyed and frustrated.<br/><br/>“Hey, search for items in the factory first. Even if you rush to them even now, you won’t get anywhere unless you’re prepared first. Jisu, please calm down. We need to take care of the imminent task first.”<br/><br/>So, they decided to take care of the task at hand, which was to sort out the valuable items that the members of the vampire organization piled up in the factory for the past few days. And this place was more than a bonanza. As they were not monster hunters but player hunters, they collected and piled up a pretty large amount of pretty useful stuff.<br/><br/>“I feel like I’m digging into a squirrel den,” Hanho murmured.<br/><br/>Then he took out a paper box from the president’s cabinet.<br/><br/>“How many potions are in the box?”<br/><br/>The box was filled with all kinds of potions such as stamina, mana, and antidotes. Among them were several high-quality potions called ‘therapeutics (intermediate),’ which were used to alleviate or cure various infections.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, according to the description, this also applies to zombie or vampire infections.”<br/><br/>“Okay, store them well.”<br/><br/>They also obtained all kinds of daily necessities and weapons.<br/><br/>“Oh, look at this,” said Jisu, showing Sungwoo a square thing.<br/><br/>[Item Information]<br/><br/>-Name: Charger (small)<br/><br/>-Grade: General<br/><br/>-Category: Other<br/><br/>-Effect: Supply power or charge a battery. (Remaining capacity: 87%)<br/><br/>It seemed that this kind of stuff was contained in ‘other item,’ which he had never chosen before. On the fifth day in the changed world, power was still being supplied as if power plants were operating normally. But it was still unclear as to what would happen in the future. Aside from other stuff, Sungwoo needed a cell phone battery to use the ‘Player Guidebook.’<br/><br/>-Battery charging (10 minutes left)<br/><br/>When he placed his phone against the charger item, a message appeared. The charging was pretty fast.<br/><br/>‘If it is a small battery, it means that there is a large one too. And if it is a high-grade item, it may be able to supply power to the building.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought it was necessary to obtain and keep the “other item” as well.<br/><br/>Kyongsu, along with the survivors of the factory, carried the collected items in the baggage compartment of the bus. Now, the survivors from the school looked more clean and neat than they were on the first day.<br/><br/>“I have a wound healing skill because my job is a “healer.” Hey, let me take a look at your wounded arm.”<br/><br/>“Everyone! We’ve got a lot to eat here, so please share. Man, they stacked up a bunch of food here.”<br/><br/>Then each of them started to move, depending on their roles.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, they were at a loss about what to do because they were embarrassed. But they were back to normal, doing their bit faithfully.<br/><br/>‘It’s good that they have started to adapt to the new situation,’ Sungwoo thought to himself.<br/><br/>But it was because they luckily survived that they were functioning now. In other words, they began to realize it belatedly. But how many of them could survive to the end?<br/><br/>Night came. The survivors decided to spend the night inside the factory.<br/><br/>Soon, the young gangsters including Taesung came into the factory, so it was crowded with many people now. When Sungwoo frowned at their bikes, Taesung, who led the pack, approached him awkwardly, checking his expression, “Brother Sungwoo…”<br/><br/>“Why am I your brother?”<br/><br/>“Uh…Captain?”<br/><br/>“Just get to the point. Don’t even think about flattering me.”<br/><br/>When he reacted coldly, Taesung looked down, low-spirited. But he soon curled up his mouth and said, “Can we also stay here?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo openly frowned at him. As expected, helpless survivors began to gather around him.<br/><br/>“Come tomorrow. I’m leaving tomorrow.”<br/><br/>“Oh, well, Captain, please. We have nowhere to go. We never know when the wolf-like monsters will storm us in the joint market, so we are just restless…” said Taesung with an earnest expression.<br/><br/>“Where is your vampire friend?”<br/><br/>“Ah…she got a little better after having a little blood pack. She will be alright. I swear she won’t run wildly anymore.”<br/><br/>“How can I trust you? You have lost my trust already.”<br/><br/>“Well…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo glanced at Jisu standing next to him. Then she gave Taesung a white potion.<br/><br/>“I don’t know if it will work, but have her try this.”<br/><br/>“Ah? This one?”<br/><br/>It was the ‘medicine’ she just found.<br/><br/>According to the description, it was also effective on vampire infections.<br/><br/>But she was not sure if it could cure Yujin 100%. </div><h2 id="chapter47">Chapter 47</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “If she goes insane again, I’ll kill her immediately. If she is possessed by the Vampire Lord and digs up information about us, I’ll also kill her. So, keep an eye on her carefully.”<br/><br/>“Sure!”<br/><br/>“And you’re not free here.”<br/><br/>“…Pardon?”<br/><br/>“You guys have been the vampires’ slaves until now. From now on, you have a new master.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was absolutely comfortable when he was alone, but he needed some subordinates that he could use for a variety of purposes freely.<br/><br/>“Thank you! Just give me any assignment!”<br/><br/>“Man, you have such a way with words like a sophisticated gangster!”<br/><br/>“Hahaha…”<br/><br/>In fact, the main reason why Taesung’s party left the joint market, or their original hideout, was because they were so scared about the ‘human animals’ like Werewolf and Werebear.<br/><br/>Since they were changed from those humans who didn’t choose their occupation cards, the way they acted was pretty different from animal monsters. They not only moved around very large areas, but they also freely searched for survivors inside the buildings.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Sungwoo decided to make use of Hanho’s father, Jungho’s ability to create a ‘pioneer camp,’ namely a safety zone. He wanted to test Jungho’s capabilities.<br/><br/>Woowoong!<br/><br/>When Jungho used the skill, something like a translucent glow extended from the place where he was standing.<br/><br/>-The affected area is now designated as a ‘pioneer camp.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Certain areas are protected by a ‘shield’ from the center.<br/><br/>Recovery will be faster within the camp.<br/><br/>The manager can register access restrictions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was fixed at a height of 10 meters and an area of 200 meters. Fortunately, the area covered the entire factory.<br/><br/>“Yeah, I feel like I just came out of a sauna.”<br/><br/>As a result, the 57 survivors could rest comfortably. They could fill up their empty stomachs with the stockpiled food and wash themselves at the toilets inside the factory.<br/><br/>Hanho’s mother, Eunhee, made the food as a cook according to her occupation card. She started to boil something in a large pot in the factory kitchen.<br/><br/>Frightened, Hanho said she put in the Dire Wolf meat that accumulated in the factory.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the pretty fragrant scent filled the entire place, and the survivors who ate vegetables for days savored the meat.<br/><br/>“Now, please taste the soup. When you are exhausted, hot soup is the best.”<br/><br/>Hanho grabbed a large pot and put it down in the middle of the factory. And then he handed out paper cups to everyone.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, please take your scoop first.”<br/><br/>Though the ingredients of the soup were not known, Sungwoo took a scoop of it.<br/><br/>He was bothered by Hanho’s words that the Dire Wolf meat was mixed in it, but he was expecting to eat monster meat in the near future. So, he needed to get used to such meat anyway.<br/><br/>“Um. It tastes good.”<br/><br/>-Your stamina has increased because of special dishes.<br/><br/>*Your Physical Strength is recovering rapidly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Stamina will increase for 20 minutes. (+2)<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t just okay, but excellent. Though temporary, the soup showed various effects.<br/><br/>Given that increasing stats was possible only through leveling up, it was terrific to increase stats through food. In other words, she was not a cook just because she cooked.<br/><br/>“Wow, this soup tastes heavenly!”<br/><br/>“You bet! I’ve never tasted such a delicious soup before.”<br/><br/>Others also admired the delicious soup.<br/><br/>Sungwoo had another scoop of the soup that Eunhee named ‘Wolf Soup,’ then got out of the noisy workplace for the president’s office. Jisu followed him.<br/><br/>“Hey, Sungwoo.”<br/><br/>“Yeah?”<br/><br/>“That massacre.”<br/><br/>“I was also agonizing over it.”<br/><br/>After hearing about the planned massacre from him, Jisu seemed to be occupied with the idea of stopping it. But she could not dare to speak about it first because she relied on him for her survival.<br/><br/>“Jisu, have you ever received an exclusive quest?”<br/><br/>Was it an unexpected question? She blinked her eyes.<br/><br/>“Pardon? Exclusive…No, I haven’t.”<br/><br/>Sitting on a chair, he nodded. He’d received them twice, but what were the conditions for the exclusive quests? What was the Vampire Lord’s quest? Was this given to all players?<br/><br/>‘And what is the final purpose of the quest?’<br/><br/>The quest gave two options. What could he expect at the end of the numerous forks? There was nothing he could determine right away. He had to make the necessary choice now. Then what did he need now?<br/><br/>‘The Vampire Lord’s head.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s bad entanglement with the Vampire Lord won’t end until he cuts his hair.<br/><br/>So, beheading him as soon as possible was the answer.<br/><br/>“Jisu, it’s not our duty to stop the massacre, right?”<br/><br/>“Oh, it’s not, but…”<br/><br/>“Then why should we stop the massacre?”<br/><br/>Jisu was speechless at his question. She gently pressed her lower lip and said,<br/><br/>“Otherwise we will be killed first by the vampire shits one day.”<br/><br/>At that moment, the two looked up into the sky at the same time.<br/><br/>-(!)<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, do you see this?”<br/><br/>A red exclamation mark appeared before their eyes. Then a long message appeared.<br/><br/>[Mainstream Start Guide]<br/><br/>-CHAPTER 1: Still a Long Dark Night<br/><br/>Dear all survivors, welcome to the big creek major stream. Lots of time has passed since destruction came to this world. In the meantime, many people have died, and those who could not follow the change were cursed as ‘human animals.’ I commend you for having survived the disaster. But the ordeal will come to you from now on. Don’t forget that the most important thing in survival games is to struggle. Whether the target is the world, monsters, or humans, you have to be a little bolder to survive.<br/><br/>[Precautions (Important)]<br/><br/>The event will be held for 7 days, and movement to other areas will be limited within the time period. (Currently available areas: Suwon Hwaseong)<br/><br/>Double gold acquisition.<br/><br/>The ‘second player’ is given a chance to obtain a random link card whenever hunting ‘human animals.’<br/><br/>Boss monsters will appear by region. Opportunities to get powerful items are not available in the shop!<br/><br/>“…I think what Jisu said is the right answer. Now, we have decided on our journey.”<br/><br/>“Oh, now we’re in the ring, right?”<br/><br/>Movement to other areas is not possible. Like Jisu said, they seemed to have come to the situation where they, trapped in a ring with vampires, would have to fight for life or death.<br/><br/>This crazy game has only just begun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, you decided to post a thread, right? Good decision. We can’t tolerate reading the vampires’ fake ads, right?”<br/><br/>“Well, not necessarily, but I have something to write about.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo wrote his first post on the community bulletin. Then they began to reply to his comment.<br/><br/>[12] Let’s visit the Safety Zone carefully.<br/><br/>-Author: kor-157 │ Views: 17,456<br/><br/>People who already read the first thread on the H Apartments know it already, but don’t ever think somebody will do you a favor with a pure heart.

                            Meanwhile, ‘Youngdungpo Prosecutor’, recognized as a guru in the community, posted a long thread immediately after checking the comments.<br/><br/>[14] The establishment of the Yeongdeungpo Survivor Guild proclaimed<br/><br/>-Author: Youngdungpo Prosecutor │ Views: 20,444<br/><br/>We have concluded that we can no longer wait for the government’s help, so we want to create a player community called “Liberation.” This guild’s primary goals are group survival, seeking to secure a Safety Zone, helping survivors, and further cracking down on the monsters […]<br/><br/>「Comments: 59」<br/><br/>“Guild? It must be the kind of guild that appears in online games, right?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded when Hanho asked, saying, “I think so. Now I think I know why he posted a comment on my threat a moment ago. He didn’t want me to join his group — he just wanted to publicize that they weren’t a bad group.”<br/><br/>“Really? He did the same thing last time. He must be a sophisticated guy.”<br/><br/>“Well, ambitious humans like him are starting to emerge.”<br/><br/>His announcement that he would create a ‘guild’, or a group of game players, had quite a variety of meanings. What he meant was that he would form not just a group of survivors helping each other, but a coalition with a common belief. It also meant that he, acknowledging the absence of the government, would establish a new system. People like him began to emerge everywhere to create their own power.<br/><br/>“I think those who think they have some power will raise their ugly heads everywhere. So I think we better be ready not to be sandwiched between their fighting for hegemony.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo had the survivors bear some of the cost of maintaining the Safety Zone. He also collected a certain amount of gold for Jungho.<br/><br/>“I think a total of 4,400 gold will suffice for the time being.”<br/><br/>“Yes, thank you.”<br/><br/>Jungho had already used up all his mana, so ten gold per ten minutes was deducted to maintain the Safety Zone. To keep it all day, it required as much as 1,440 gold. Since it was so hard to obtain gold, it was necessary to maintain a standing combat army to maintain the Safety Zone. Accordingly, it was certain that a large group would have powerful weapons.<br/><br/>“Oh, you said we could get access to the Safety Zone, right?”<br/><br/>“Right. Let me see…but if I restrict that area, no one can enter it during the restriction period.”<br/><br/>“Then, please restrict it after we leave it.”<br/><br/>“Sure. let me keep that in mind.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo checked the time. It was seven o’clock in the morning. It was time for the Vampire Lord’s ‘Blood Tracking’ system to display Sungwoo’s current location.<br/><br/>‘That bastard won’t give me up.’<br/><br/>There was no chance that the Vampire Lord would leave Sungwoo intact when his quest was exposed to him and his major stronghold was destroyed by him. Even though he wouldn’t attack Sungwoo in person, he would send his subordinates to chase him.<br/><br/>‘I must always be on alert for their surprise attack.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo set the vibration alarm for 12 hours later.<br/><br/>“Now let’s move.”<br/><br/>His party was ready to go outside the Safe Zone. Sungwoo called Taesung to the president’s office.<br/><br/>“You guys riding the motorcycles now, right?”<br/><br/>“Oh, yes! We have brought a total of six, plus several barrels of gas, so…”<br/><br/>“Then go to Suwon Hwaseong now.”<br/><br/>“…Pardon? Why?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo explained the plot to Taesung, the ‘Great Massacre’ plan now underway in the Safety Zone in Suwon Hwaseong.<br/><br/>“Survivors from this area will be moving there in droves. Infiltrate the Safety Zone run by them and keep an eye on everything. Then, if something happens…you remember my thread about this on the community bulletin, right?”<br/><br/>“Yes, I saw it.”<br/><br/>“Just post any comment there. Then a notification will pop up on my side. Don’t worry about who can read it. As soon as I read it, I’ll delete it right away.”<br/><br/>There was a reason why Sungwoo posted a thread on the community bulletin by using 1000 points. Currently, their phones and the internet were not working. Accordingly, the community bulletin was the only means of communication.<br/><br/>“Can you do it?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was now asking Taesung and his friends to go into enemy territory at the risk of their lives where he didn’t know when the massacre could happen.<br/><br/>However, Taesung nodded, saying, “…Sure. Anyway, we’ve already had the experience of spending a few days with the vampires anyway..”<br/><br/>Soon, Taesung started the bike with three friends. When they disappeared from the factory, it was time for Sungwoo’s party to act.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, what are we going to do now?”<br/><br/>“We have to level up. What level are you?”<br/><br/>“Uh, I’m five.”<br/><br/>“Who are you going to fight at that level?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party went on to ‘hunt.’ However, Sungwoo’s goal was not to level up. He planned to secure as many ‘human animals’ as possible, so he could form a mixed group of Werewolves and Werebears to confront the vampires. That was his goal today.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the sixth day after the world turned into a game, the survivors were united by creating a Safety Zone or they stayed put in their houses, isolated from the outside.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the streets were occupied by the monsters. A group of Dire Wolves ran wildly on the 8-lane road, chasing their prey. They didn’t care about their targets. They ate anything small and fragile indiscriminately.<br/><br/>Weak and small goblins occupied the old malls in remote areas. Sensing there was a variety of food inside the ‘square stones that blow out cold,’ they started to break open the windows of ordinary men’s houses. Those hiding there were naturally sacrificed.<br/><br/>The orcs that loved wastelands built camps on school playgrounds. As if they didn’t like the man-made buildings, they cut the desks, , and trees on the streets to build ugly edifices.<br/><br/>But colorful industrial products were very popular among them. So if they found anything colorful, such as clothespins or lollipops, they weaved them together to make necklaces.<br/><br/>“What a mess!”<br/><br/>“I don’t think that kind of description is accurate.”<br/><br/>The party of four including Kyongsu, who also joined Sungwoo’s party, ran through the hellish downtown area and hunted all the monsters they could. But they had to avoid the large orc clan which numbered more than 200.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there were also monsters they encountered for the first time.<br/><br/>“Watch your back!”<br/><br/>Brown-skinned dwarfs crawled out of the sewer and attacked Sungwoo’s members from behind. But they easily and quickly beat the dwarfs because they had enough fighting experience.<br/><br/>“Well, they look like goblins.”<br/><br/>“They are not that threatening. They’re called Kobolds,” Jisu said, brushing off the blood of the blade.<br/><br/>It seemed that a “Kobold” clan had settled in the sewer or the subway, building their own areas.<br/><br/>“By the way, this is like a magic attack, isn’t it?”<br/><br/>Kyongsu pointed to the bumper of the white Pride sedan parked in front of the mall.<br/><br/>The middle of the bumper was already melted, dyed in green.<br/><br/>Escaping from the green fireball by the skin of his teeth, Hanho swallowed, looking at it.<br/><br/>“Oh my goodness, I might have died if I had not increased Agility! The monsters are using magic too.”<br/><br/>“You bet. We have to be more careful.”<br/><br/>Then they encountered three Dire Wolves. However, one Werewolf skeleton ripped their snouts violently like King Kong did.<br/><br/>“Sure enough, human animals are overwhelmingly powerful.”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo’s party easily removed the Dire Wolf herd on the streets, they began to act more aggressively. However, they could not find the prey that Sungwoo wanted, namely ‘human animals’ like Werewolves or Werebears.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, how about B-mart over there?”<br/><br/>When they turned around the alley, Hanho raised his finger and pointed to the front.<br/><br/>It was a large three-story mart.<br/><br/>“Let’s go there.”<br/><br/>Aside from hunting, they could not neglect collecting the necessary items, also called ‘farming.’<br/><br/>Such a large mart probably had quite a few useful items including food.<br/><br/>So, they approached the mart when they saw lots of cars entangled here and there while trying to flee from the scene in a chaotic situation. It was a familiar scene.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, don’t you think you experienced this kind of situation at the entrance to our school?”<br/><br/>“I feel the same way, too.” </div><h2 id="chapter49">Chapter 49</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Like she said, lots of cars were tangled up here and there in front of the mart.<br/><br/>It reminded Sungwoo of the same scene in front of campus.<br/><br/>He thought that this place might have been exposed to the “tutorial” in which nobody could go out until they killed the boss monster, with the entrance sealed. And that tutorial didn’t take place everywhere. For example, Hanho’s parents stayed safe inside the house without being forced to act according to an unexpected quest, and they were safely in the house.<br/><br/>“Well, someone might be inside the mart, right?”<br/><br/>“A place like a mart has lots of daily necessities, so it wouldn’t be bad for them to take refuge there. However, it is so wide that it is difficult to manage unless they are a large group because they never know when the monsters will appear.”<br/><br/>They passed through the mart entrance and entered the ground parking lot.<br/><br/>There were tons of human bodies, goblins, and kobold bodies strewn all over the place. While looking at them, Jisu said, “The more people there are, the more monsters appear, right?”<br/><br/>“Well, it looks like that, as far as I can tell.”<br/><br/>There were more monsters in downtown areas, schools, and apartments compared to the outskirts.<br/><br/>Like she said, it was really possible that more monsters appeared in places where a lot of people resided.<br/><br/>“Therefore, remote places would have less damage, I think. For example, those in the countryside or Jeju Island.”<br/><br/>“Oh, you told me before that your family lives on Jeju Island, right?”<br/><br/>Jisu remained silent for a moment. Oddly enough, she did not bring up anything about her family.<br/><br/>Besides, she didn’t even search for her family on the community bulletin.<br/><br/>“Ah, well…” Her voice faded as if she was reluctant to answer.<br/><br/>So Sungwoo asked cautiously, “Aren’t you worried about your family?”<br/><br/>“I wasn’t at first, but yes, I am now.”<br/><br/>“Then why don’t you post a thread on it?”<br/><br/>She shook her head and said, “No. We were not supposed to contact each other anyway. I think they’re well because they’re on a roll…” Her voice trembled with contempt.<br/><br/>It seemed she had a sensitive family issue, so he didn’t ask further.<br/><br/>Finally, they arrived at the entrance of the mart.<br/><br/>He opened the sliding glass door that was almost broken down…<br/><br/>-You have entered the large-scale dungeon, ‘The Fortress of the Kobold Sorcerer.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The entrance has been sealed by magic. Explore your way out of the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Huh?’<br/><br/>“This whole place is a dungeon?”<br/><br/>They gazed around here and there inside the dark building.<br/><br/>“Uh! Sungwoo!” Jisu shouted urgently.<br/><br/>For some reason, she was looking down at his feet.<br/><br/>“….What’s wrong?”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo looked down, he saw some green figures drawn on the floor. It was emitting light in the form of a certain pattern. What the heck was this?<br/><br/>‘Magic pattern?’<br/><br/>At that moment, his body was shrouded with light. Then the space changed in an instant, and he was falling down somewhere. He soon saw the floor, so he reached out urgently and touched the floor.<br/><br/>“Oops!”<br/><br/>He fell down, his entire body impacted. However, the impact wasn’t strong enough to injure him.<br/><br/>He immediately raised his head and checked around. It was a warehouse filled with all kinds of boxes.<br/><br/>Rustle, rustle.<br/><br/>Several small shadows began to squeeze their way through the boxes.<br/><br/>“Caught!”<br/><br/>“Oh, good!”<br/><br/>They were brown-skinned monsters, namely Kobolds. A total of seven were approaching him, and their appearances were so ridiculous.<br/><br/>‘What the heck is that?”<br/><br/>It seemed that they put on the clothes from the clothing section that was randomly inside the mart. But since there were no clothes that fit the dwarves like them, there was an error.<br/><br/>It happened that they chose lacy pink dresses with or suspenders with teddy bears on them.<br/><br/>“Lol! Another human has been caught!”<br/><br/>“He’s the third one!”<br/><br/>One of them even put some hard objects in a bra and tightened it with a hook.<br/><br/>‘Oh my… did it wear the bra thinking it was armor?’ Sungwoo murmured.<br/><br/>“Human! You trod on it. Stupid!”<br/><br/>“He can’t do it alone! No way! Only death now! Isn’t he funny? Lol!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo could hardly believe his ears. How could monsters like them speak the human language?<br/><br/>He raised his body and dusted off his clothes. A Kobold surrounded him and wielded all kinds of weapons threateningly.<br/><br/>“Sacrifices! Experiment! Magic!”<br/><br/>“Alone…!”<br/><br/>Monsters or humans, those who first encounter the Necromancer misunderstand that they can win easily because they are superior numerically.<br/><br/>As usual, those who thought so collapsed in the next moment.<br/><br/>-Your subordinates are returning to their present position.<br/><br/>Rattle—<br/><br/>“…Ugh? What the heck…?”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo summoned a couple of Werewolves, the small goblins were killed on the spot. After getting rid of the obstacles, he moved right away. Since he was separated from his members in the dungeon, he had to quickly find an exit and join them because they wouldn’t stick it out for long without him.<br/><br/>‘Is this underground?’<br/><br/>The warehouse was larger than he thought. He turned on his cell phone flashlight to find the exit. Then he found a body in the corner of the warehouse. He thought of passing by it, but he approached it instead, wondering if he could collect a useful item.<br/><br/>“…Cough!”<br/><br/>To his surprise, that man was still alive.<br/><br/>“Uhhhh…”<br/><br/>That man looked like a high school boy in school uniform, but he was not armed at all.<br/><br/>When Sungwoo checked his wounds, his torso was completely crushed. At first glance, it seemed that the ‘health recovery potions’ that he carried could not cure him.<br/><br/>“Cough….”<br/><br/>Looking at Sungwoo, he tried to say something with his glowing eyes. However, Sungwoo could not understand him well because of his phlegmy voice. He raised his trembling finger desperately, so Sungwoo looked at his fingertip. On the shelf of the warehouse was a yellow paper box. Sungwoo reached out and took out the paper box.<br/><br/>“What is this?”<br/><br/>There was a smooth black stone in it.<br/><br/>[Item Information]<br/><br/>-Name: Unknown egg<br/><br/>-Rating: Unknown<br/><br/>-Category: Exclusive item for ‘Dragon Knight(★★★★★)’ occupation<br/><br/>-Effect: Unknown<br/><br/>-Description: Don’t be disappointed by looking at the shell. If you keep this egg, the instant something comes out after breaking its shell, your fate will change.<br/><br/>At that moment, the student, presumed to have been the owner of the egg, vomited out a mouthful of bloody phlegm and finally began to speak.<br/><br/>“Uhhhhh…the boss monster has this token…”<br/><br/>“What token?”<br/><br/>“Master…token…”<br/><br/>After saying that, the remnant vitality in his eyes slowly disappeared. Sungwoo looked at the egg in his hand. Perhaps, the boss monster in this dungeon seemed to have something valuable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo moved on, leaving behind the boy’s body.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, he was concerned about the ‘unidentified egg’ in the bag.<br/><br/>‘This egg is mysterious, but…’<br/><br/>Although the item was an unknown egg, its description was written as an “exclusive item for the Dragon Knight job.” So, he actually got the answer.<br/><br/>‘This is a dragon’s egg. But will a dragon really be born from the egg?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo recalled the boy’s last words for some clues. The boy said that the boss monster had something to prove its owner. Perhaps the boy was trapped in this dungeon after stopping by this mart, and then he was robbed of something by the boss monster.<br/><br/>‘Dragons are generally much more powerful than Wyverns. If the boss monster had such a monster…’<br/><br/>If it really happened, something really outrageous would take place.<br/><br/>Everything was unclear, but if there existed such a thing, he had to secure it first.<br/><br/>But it was far from easy for him to search for the boss monster. Given that there was the modifier ‘large’ before this dungeon, there were quite a few monsters in the mart.<br/><br/>“Keeh! Human! Kill him!”<br/><br/>“There he is!”<br/><br/>“Good! Good!”<br/><br/>He didn’t know where they came out from, but they jumped out of every corner of the warehouse like cockroaches. When one of them discovered Sungwoo and shouted, they began to approach him en masse as if on cue. Since the warehouse was installed with various shelves inside, Sungwoo could not predict when and where they would pop out. </div><h2 id="chapter50">Chapter 50</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            They crawled off the floor, jumped from the shelves, or popped out of cardboard boxes.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, they were only dwarf goblins. They were a bit stronger and a bit smarter than goblins, but they were no match for Sungwoo who was escorted by the skeletons.<br/><br/>Rattle, rattle.<br/><br/>Sungwoo stood up against the swarm of Kobolds with skeletons standing on all sides.<br/><br/>Only Right and three orc skeletons guarded him, with the rest charging at the Kobold monsters and they began to crush them.<br/><br/>Bang! Thump!<br/><br/>Screaming rang throughout the warehouse when their bones and intestines were shattered.<br/><br/>Fighting with them went on smoothly, but Sungwoo felt something strange as time went on.<br/><br/>“Keeh! Happy!”<br/><br/>“Fight and die!”<br/><br/>Obviously, the orc skeletons were massacring them, but there was no sign of them retreating. They screamed weirdly as if they were addicted to drugs, and charged at the skeletons back and forth insanely. It reminded him of a gang of zombies.<br/><br/>-You have earned 150 gold by hunting a Kobold.<br/><br/>-You have earned 150 gold by hunting a Kobold.<br/><br/>-You have earned 150 gold by hunting a Kobold.<br/><br/>The outcome of the hunting was satisfactory. After the mainstream hunt began, he earned twice as much gold as before for the past 7 days. He easily obtained an enormous amount of gold.<br/><br/>‘I’ve hunted almost 40 so far… How much is it then? Wow, this is a bonanza!’<br/><br/>When he felt relaxed and satisfied with the hunt, he noticed some green light sputtering in the front.<br/><br/>Pop!<br/><br/>One of the orc skeletons at the forefront collapsed all of a sudden.<br/><br/>‘It is a wizard.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought he was in trouble. Never did he expect that there was one among the Kobolds that could cast a spell. Although he had experienced it before, he completely forgot about it because of the simple and clear patterns of the enemies.<br/><br/>“Khhhhk! Magic is beautiful!”<br/><br/>He saw a Kobold holding a blunt stick, with an upside-down yellow duck. At first glance, it looked like a wizard.<br/><br/>‘Go up.’<br/><br/>According to Sungwoo’s direction, the vampire skeleton stomped the ground, then hung gently on the ceiling pipe.<br/><br/>Poof!<br/><br/>The green flame once again flew over the skeletons. Since they were anticipating it, the skeletons dispersed to the left and right, avoiding the magic spell. As the missed magic spell hit the shelf, the objects on it fell down.<br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/>At that moment, the vampire skeleton, hanging on the ceiling pipe, landed on the wizard’s back.<br/><br/>“Khhhhe!” It was the Kobold’s last groan.<br/><br/>The vampire skeleton’s rugged hands pierced its neck.<br/><br/>-You have earned 800 gold by hunting the Kobold wizard.<br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 9)<br/><br/>Sungwoo selected the ‘skill’ item from the level up card. He chose it to increase the number of subordinates, but what he got was completely new.<br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/>-Name: Corpse Explosion<br/><br/>-Grade: Basic<br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/>-Cost: 10 mana<br/><br/>*Causes an explosion with the corpse as a detonator.<br/><br/>“Explosion?” Sungwoo looked at the front.<br/><br/>“Kuhhhhh!”<br/><br/>Kill him! Tear him!”<br/><br/>A group of Kobolds showed up around the corner, and there were four of them.<br/><br/>Sungwoo had the vampire skeletons stand in the back and fired the ‘Corpse Explosion’ skill on the Kobold wizard standing there.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>-You have earned 150 gold by hunting a Kobold.<br/><br/>-You have earned 150 gold by hunting a Kobold.<br/><br/>-You have earned 150 gold by hunting a Kobold.<br/><br/>-You have earned 150 gold by hunting a Kobold.<br/><br/>After a tremendous noise, there was a brief silence.<br/><br/>“Good, isn’t it?”<br/><br/>And soon the exit of the warehouse appeared. It seemed that Sungwoo had finally arrived at the new stage after killing numerous monsters.<br/><br/>Squeak—–<br/><br/>Right carefully opened the door, and Sungwoo looked outside, standing behind it.<br/><br/>This was the first basement level. And, like most large marts, the first basement floor was a place for food supplies. But there was something huge and strange in the middle.<br/><br/>“Tree?”<br/><br/>Upon close examination, it was the root of a tree. A huge, thick root that filled the ceiling came down to the floor, and four Kobolds were seen sitting cross-legged around the root. It was as if they were performing a ritual.<br/><br/>Sungwoo walked to the outside as carefully as possible.<br/><br/>And at that moment, a warning message rang.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Warning! A Kobold wizard is practicing a ‘low-level instant death magic.’<br/><br/>Players under Level 10 in the dungeon will be killed instantly.<br/><br/>Stop it before the time limit! (01:05:30)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Instant death?”<br/><br/>As expected, this wasn’t a normal dungeon, especially given the size of the dungeon, the number of monsters coming out, and even a timed mission like this. It was a very good combination of various things. The remaining amount of time was only an hour.<br/><br/>Since everyone including Sungwoo was under Level 10, all of them would be killed if they could not stop the Kobold wizard within an hour.<br/><br/>“Charge!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not afford to stand idle. He immediately dispatched three Werewolves.<br/><br/>They quickly charged toward and assaulted the Kobold wizards sitting cross-legged.<br/><br/>“Kuueeh!”<br/><br/>Hearing the sound of bones hitting against each other, the wizards stood up, but there was not enough time to cast the spell.<br/><br/>The three beast skeletons ruthlessly slaughtered the wizards. Nevertheless, the wizards’ spell didn’t end yet.<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo immediately rushed to the root of the tree with skeletons on both sides. The thick root was tightly curled up like a cage. On the floor was a large LED TV projecting a blue screen with the screen facing up. And a Kobold was sitting cross-legged on it, which was very eerie.<br/><br/>-The boss monster “Advanced Kobold Wizard” has appeared.<br/><br/>This was the owner of the dungeon. However, it didn’t seem to be interested in what was happening outside the wooden cage because even if its subordinates were slaughtered right before its eyes and Sungwoo came near, it didn’t bat an eye.<br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, Sungwoo knew why.<br/><br/>-There is a strong protective shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It cannot be destroyed by any ordinary attack. Destroy the ‘cores’ scattered throughout the dungeon. (0/3)<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, this cage made out of the tree root was protected with a spell.<br/><br/>So, the advanced wizard was still casting spells, relying on the protection of the tree.<br/><br/>‘Core? What is a core?’<br/><br/>He didn’t know what a core was, but it wasn’t easy to find all three while fighting a huge number of Kobolds in this spacious mart. Moreover, the remaining time was only about an hour. Sungwoo approached the tree root cage and looked inside. The boss monster was muttering something, wearing several electronic watches on its hands. And a black sword was placed on the purple icebox behind its back.<br/><br/>‘That’s the token the boy mentioned to me!’<br/><br/>Sungwoo was sure that given the black blade or the elaborately-designed guard or handle, it was an unusual weapon. Then he checked the protective shield. The translucent blue shield was spread out in a hemispherical shape along the tree root cage. To put it simply, it was covered by a Kobold for protection.<br/><br/>‘Hemispherical?’<br/><br/>‘If so, doesn’t that mean the floor is not protected?’ After agonizing for a moment, he ordered the skeletons, “Collect all the bodies!”<br/><br/>Fortunately, Sungwoo obtained a fantastic skill. Ten skeletons scattered all over the place at once. Soon, the skeletons reappeared with Kobold bodies in their hands.<br/><br/>“Oh, let me take that out.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo excluded the Kobold Wizard from the corpses to be used as the explosion trigger.<br/><br/>A wizard skeleton? He felt like something from a different concept would be created.<br/><br/>He exploded the very first skeleton hastily to test the skill, but he planned to use the corpses this time. Of course, he didn’t need it right now, so he put it off for a moment.<br/><br/>”To stop the wizard from casting a spell within the set time, I have to make this guy stand up.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo had the skeletons place the collected bodies around the cage.<br/><br/>Soon, the bodies were piled up all over the place, which numbered over 30.<br/><br/>“Stand back.”<br/><br/>When they were done, Sungwoo stepped back with them. The mana required to explode 30 bodies was 300. Looking at the pile of corpses, he infused a lot of mana.<br/><br/>Woowoong—<br/><br/>Then, the mart shook violently, and then the bodies began to explode with tremendous light.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! </div><h2 id="chapter51">Chapter 51</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            The huge concrete structure shook with sparks with smoke soaring and large debris scattered all over the place.<br/><br/>Hiding behind the skeletons, Sungwoo waited for the impact of the explosions to stop.<br/><br/>Khoooo….<br/><br/>Soon the explosions stopped, and the cloudy smoke gradually began to disappear.<br/><br/>Sungwoo furtively poked his head out over the skeletons.<br/><br/>“…Was it too harsh?”<br/><br/>Fortunately, the building itself did not collapse.<br/><br/>Sungwoo blasted the middle of the mart with the new skill, Body Explosion. When the dust and smoke disappeared, the wooden cage was gone entirely. And there was a large pit in its place. He slowly approached the pit.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the protective shield was still intact. The high-level Kobold wizard was standing on the collapsed floor, staggering. Raising its head, the Kobold confirmed that the protective shield was not damaged.<br/><br/>“Kuhhhh!”<br/><br/>The Kobold smiled with relief and then began casting spells again. The countdown, which paused for a moment, resumed.<br/><br/>-There exists a strong protective shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It cannot be destroyed by any ordinary attack. Destroy the ‘cores’ scattered throughout the dungeon. (0/3)<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Okay, so the makeshift solution won’t work here.’<br/><br/>There was only one way now. Sungwoo had to find the core.<br/><br/>Although the mart was dark, spacious, and complex, he could kill the Kobold if he could find his party and attack together within an hour.<br/><br/>He turned away from the pit, but he noticed the body of the Kobold wizard.<br/><br/>‘Perhaps?’<br/><br/>He nullified the summoning of the orc skeletons, and resurrected the four killed Kobold wizards.<br/><br/>-The dead have become your subordinate under your authority.<br/><br/>-The dead have become your subordinate under your authority.<br/><br/>-The dead have become your subordinate under your authority.<br/><br/>-The dead have become your subordinate under your authority.<br/><br/>-‘Synergy effect’ is triggered by team play.<br/><br/>[Synergy list]<br/><br/>Apprentice Wizard (Stage 1)<br/> -Category: Synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: 3 or more wizards<br/><br/>-Effect: Increase spell speed (+20%)<br/><br/>Aside from this synergy, the message that he really wanted came next.<br/><br/>-You can check the ‘memory fragments’ of the dead.<br/><br/>“…Oh, I see.”<br/><br/>After seeing the memory of the dead first when he saved the branch manager, Sungwoo pondered over the conditions under which it would be triggered. At first, he thought it was given when he resurrected a human being.<br/><br/>Come to think of it now, even a monster like a Kobold with a certain level of intelligence had the memory of the dead. He couldn’t figure out how smart these guys were compared to the goblins or orcs. Given that they were using crude human language, they must be better than goblins or orcs. Anyway, it was clear that the memory fragments selectively showed the information Sungwoo wanted.<br/><br/>‘Ugh? I can’t see well.’<br/><br/>However, the Kobold’s intellect seemed weak because the reproduced memory was blurry.<br/><br/>Sungwoo saw that they talked to each other, chuckled, then moved elsewhere in excitement. With the utmost concentration, he tried to read their travel path and background in the blurred memory. As a result, he discovered that they arrived at a ‘butcher shop.’<br/><br/>They installed something there.<br/><br/>‘Good. I’ve identified one place.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo read the memory fragments of the other three Kobolds one after another.<br/><br/>As if it didn’t install the core, one of them paced up and down the cage, but the other two spat out the right information.<br/><br/>‘It’s the home appliances shop and the rooftop. First of all, let me move to the butcher shop.’<br/><br/>The butcher shop was not far. It was right in the corner of the first basement.<br/><br/>Accompanied by the skeletons, he headed there. In addition, he took out the meat refrigerator entirely and searched the inside of the butcher shop thoroughly.<br/><br/>Crackle, crackle.<br/><br/>And Right found something like a crystal ball, embedded in a tree trunk that came down the wall.<br/><br/>‘It’s a core.’<br/><br/>Without thinking further, Sungwoo smashed the core with a sword.<br/><br/>-You have destroyed a dungeon core. (1/3)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Stop the Kobold in time! (00:51:30)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. Let me move to the other two places.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo moved toward the second floor where the home appliance store was located.<br/><br/>However, there were no monsters blocking him except for the five Kobolds that he ran into on the escalator heading to the first floor.<br/><br/>At first he wondered why it was so quiet, but he now saw Kobold bodies scattered all over the ground floor. It seemed that Sungwoo’s party that was separated from him a while ago was fighting against the Kobolds well.<br/><br/>‘Jisu is a good warrior anyway.’<br/><br/>And when he went up one level and arrived at the home appliances store on the second floor, he finally found his party, namely Hanho, Jisu, and Kyongsu.<br/><br/>“They’re coming from the left too!”<br/><br/>“Kyungsu, wizard on your right!”<br/><br/>They were fighting against a group of Kobolds approaching them back to back.<br/><br/>They seemed to be in a dangerous situation, but they were knocking down the monsters one by one. So, Sungwoo decided to end their fighting a little earlier.<br/><br/>Rattle, rattle!<br/><br/>The skeletons charged at the Kobolds. In particular, when the four Kobold wizard skeletons exploded and sparked at the same time, the dark interior became bright momentarily. And under the light, bulky skeletons attacked the Kobolds too. The skeletons that appeared suddenly killed the remaining group of Kobolds immediately, while Sungwoo’s party stared at them with blank expressions in the thick of fighting.<br/><br/>“He, Sungwoo!”<br/><br/>“Welcome back!”<br/><br/>It was their dramatic reunion after about 40 minutes.<br/><br/>“I’m glad you are safe. What a relief!”<br/><br/>“Oh, we were worried about you, Sungwoo, since you disappeared after stepping on the trap…”<br/><br/>There was a sense of relief among them.<br/><br/>“By the way, have you seen that message about instant death?”<br/><br/>“Oh, yes…”<br/><br/>It seemed that the moment Sungwoo stepped on the first basement floor, the message was sent to everyone. Was the mechanism of this dungeon designed to present such a puzzling mission the moment anyone entered the boss room on the first basement level?<br/><br/>“Let’s divide us into two teams. Hanho and Jisoo, go to the consumer electronics section. If you look at the wall there, you will find a marble-like core. Destroy it. Kyongsu, please follow me.”<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought that since the monsters on the second floor were killed, he and Kyongsu were enough. The reason why he took Kyungsu with him was because he did not know the specific location of the core, and he could find it more quickly with Kyongsu. Jisu and Hanho went across the shelves, and Sungwoo and Kyongsu went up to the last floor, namely the rooftop.<br/><br/>“Oh, they have come!”<br/><br/>“Kill them!”<br/><br/>There were lots of Kobolds standing by on the rooftop. However, they were nothing more than miscellaneous monsters that only got him numerous gold. Moreover, the rooftop was more spacious than the underground warehouse, so the bulky skeletons could freely move around, getting rid of the Kobolds at once.<br/><br/>“Uh, Sungwoo? Is that a core?”<br/><br/>Kyongsu approached the trunk of the tree at the corner of the rooftop, where a large marble was embedded. It was the core. Sungwoo walked toward it quickly and struck the marble at once.<br/><br/>-You have destroyed a dungeon core. (3/3)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Stop the Kobold within the set time! (00:40:11)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu and Han also succeed in finding the core. So, they destroyed all three cores.<br/><br/>-You have destroyed all dungeon cores. The protective shield has been removed.<br/><br/>“Good. Wait for me!”<br/><br/>Now, it was time for Sungwoo to deal a painful blow to the cunning Kobold wizard. The wizard would never have imagined that Sungwoo and his party would destroy the cores in such a short time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After meeting on the second floor again, Sungwoo and his friends went straight down to the first basement level. Then they approached the hollow pit in the middle of the underground shop.<br/><br/>“…Kuuuhe?”<br/><br/>After confirming that they were looking down, the high-level Kobold wizard was full of embarrassment.<br/><br/>“Why? Can’t concentrate anymore? You have to be able to focus for 45 minutes, right?”<br/><br/>Without waiting any longer, Sungwoo fired four green flames by controlling the Kobold wizard skeletons.<br/><br/>Pop! Pop!<br/><br/>However, the wizard raised its hand, forming a small shield to stop the flames.<br/><br/>But the shock forced the Kobold to roll back and forth.<br/><br/>-Lesser instant death spell has been blocked. </div><h2 id="chapter52">Chapter 52</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “Whew!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his friends felt relieved at the message.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the Kobold wizard smacked the floor with its small hands as if it was burning up. Then it hysterically raised its head. At that moment, something was creeping out of its mouth.<br/><br/>It was a tree root. The roots that covered the entire mart began to crawl out of its body.<br/><br/>The roots thickened indefinitely and soon covered the body of the Kobold. Its arms and legs began to sprout there. At first glance, it was a human figure.<br/><br/>“Do you know what that is… Ent?”<br/><br/>When Hanho said that, red pupils appeared in the center of the tree shape.<br/><br/>-Genuine Boss Monster ‘Depraved Tree Spirit’ has appeared.<br/><br/>“It’s not the same type of Kobold,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/>Although he didn’t know about the habits of the Kobolds, he felt strange because only Kobolds here wildly charged at them like fanatics even without knowing their lives were at risk. He could not understand their actions because they were more intelligent than goblins or orcs.<br/><br/>‘As expected, this was far from an ordinary dungeon.’<br/><br/>“Let’s step back further. We never know how the Kobold will attack us.”<br/><br/>At that moment, the Depraved Tree Spirit continued to grow and soon rose above the depth of the pit. Sungwoo placed the skeletons wide so they could not be hit at once. On the one hand, he placed several skeletons at the rear and ordered them to move the Kobold bodies.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was going to attack it with the body explosion.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, look at the ceiling!” Jisoo shouted, launching herself forward.<br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/>The tree root struck the spot where Jisu just stood. Stunned, Hanho stepped back.<br/><br/>“Damn it! The ceiling is all tree roots!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party fought back. The Kobold wizard skeletons fired flames all at once, while Jisu pulled out the Ignition Whetstone and began to strike the roots descending from the ceiling.<br/><br/>Pop! Pop!<br/><br/>Green flame magic hit the trunk of the giant tree. However, it did not seem to have caused much damage, nor did the fire catch up to it. Watching it, they looked gloomy.<br/><br/>But Sungwoo had a different purpose.<br/><br/>“Oh, it seems you have a lot of mana?”<br/><br/>-You have absorbed the opponent’s mana. (+40)<br/><br/>-You have absorbed the opponent’s mana. (+36)<br/><br/>“Wow, mana is just pouring in.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo felt like he was sucking mana, as if a straw was stuck in his body. And the straw was a legendary-grade item.<br/><br/>[Item Information]<br/><br/>-Name: Demon Blood Stone<br/><br/>-Rating: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: Orb<br/><br/>-Effect: Demon property will be given to the holder. When attacking, the opponent’s mana will be robbed (+2%) *If the opponent’s mana is exhausted, it eats away at the opponent’s stamina.<br/><br/>This item robs the opponent of their mana when its caster ‘attacks’ the opponent. However, ‘Death Aura,’ the skills obtained by drawing a black wizard with a linked card, inflicts sustained damage by casting a ‘weakening’ curse on the opponent. So, the two items give out synergistic effects, making it possible to continuously steal mana.<br/><br/>Ahhhhhhh!<br/><br/>The Kobold wizard was losing its stamina and mana, even though it was not under attack.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo focused on avoiding the falling debris from the ceiling rather than inflicting damage.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, when the Werebear skeleton grabbed and pulled the roots on the ceiling, cracks formed in the ceiling, and the concrete debris fell altogether. When he removed the roots that sprouted nearby, he could reduce the fear of being attacked to some extent.<br/><br/>-The opponent’s mana has been exhausted, so its stamina is now being depleted.<br/><br/>Soon, the second condition was triggered. The roots of the tree in all directions drooped, then stopped moving. Since its mana was depleted, the Kobold wizard could no longer cast magic. In no time discharge began to come out from its body. The mix of ‘Death Aura’ and ‘Demon Blood Stone’ served as a perfect counterpunch for the wizard. The so-called boss here was disabled literally.<br/><br/>A wizard without mana? Unless it had no skill to break the curse, the wizard would be Sungwoo’s easy prey.<br/><br/>Then the wizard chose a different method. It started to crawl out of the pit by raising its massive body which was as long as five meters. Obviously it was trying to charge at and press down the skeletons with its massive weight instead of a magical attack using the roots of the ceiling. Clashing with such a massive monster was the last thing Sungwoo wanted.<br/><br/>Sungwoo had a different plan, which was body explosion.<br/><br/>“Explosion!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo prepared a few skeletons for this purpose in advance. However, he could not find the bodies of the monsters anywhere. Nevertheless, Sungwoo’s mana decreased, and there was the sound of an explosion somewhere.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>The explosion came from right above the boss monster’s head, namely the ceiling.<br/><br/>A crack occurred in some parts of the ceiling, and then quickly collapsed. Large chunks of concrete fell over the boss’s head.<br/><br/>Sungwoo had the skeletons go to the first floor and pile the monster bodies right above the boss monster’s head.<br/><br/>The boss monster moaned its last, knocked down by the concrete rubble.<br/><br/>Since its body was already left in tatters by all kinds of curses, it could not overcome the tremendous shock and pressure.<br/><br/>-You have earned 12,40 gold by hunting the Genuine Boss Monster ‘Depraved Tree Spirit.’<br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 10)<br/><br/>‘Oh, I didn’t expect to level up.’<br/><br/>This game was not very difficult for him to level up. Since he achieved Level 9 a moment ago, he thought he would have to go a long way to get to Level 10. But it seemed that the boss monster gave him a huge EXP. He also gained more rewards.<br/><br/>-‘Roulette ticket’ has been awarded for achieving Level 10.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the 69th achiever in history, it has been upgraded to the “Unlimited” ticket (100 people only)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Level 10 for the 69th time? Obviously Sungwoo seemed to be ahead.<br/><br/>Now, he was given two unlimited-grade tickets.<br/><br/>-Your subordinates have increased drastically as a result of you reaching the maximum level (+5)<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>…This must be a jackpot!<br/><br/>Even though Sungwoo was Level 10, his subordinates would increase by five skeletons? Given the fact that he had carried ten skeletons until now, he would enjoy a 50% increase in his force.<br/><br/>Then he clicked on ‘Skill’ in the level-up card selection window. He wanted to increase his subordinates as much as possible in preparation for the battle against the vampires.<br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/>-Name: Death Response<br/><br/>-Grade: Basic<br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/>-Cost: 100 mana<br/><br/>*Summon 10 unattended zombies in the abyss. This species is not limited by the number of subordinates, and disappears into dust after 10 minutes. (Cooldown: 30 minutes)<br/><br/>“Zombie? As many as ten?”<br/><br/>If so, Sungwoo could control as many as 25 undead characters. As if Level 10 was some sort of barometer, he felt like he became immensely strong. But that was not all.<br/><br/>Sungwoo headed for the pit ruined by the body explosion. A black sword was stuck there, the token of the dragon knight. He went down the pit and pulled out the knife.<br/><br/>“I think I can hunt the vampire with this.”<br/><br/>He thought it would be hunting from now on, not a battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the very sword that the killed boy referred to.<br/><br/>With a black blade and a finely-crafted hilt, it was quite different from the weapon he had been using so far.<br/><br/>[Item Information]<br/><br/>-Name: Masterless Sword<br/><br/>-Rating: Unknown<br/><br/>-Sort: Two-handed sword<br/><br/>-Effect: Muscle Strength (+6)<br/><br/>-Description: It is the key to breaking the black ‘unknown egg.’ You don’t currently qualify. So, you have no authority.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To prove your ‘qualification’ and gain authority, you must keep the egg for ‘5,000 days.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>** Whenever you soak the sword with the blood of a powerful enemy, the egg will recognize it and the hatching time will speed up.<br/><br/>Sungwoo wondered how to prove the token, but it seemed pretty clear. It meant the eligibility for the owner of the dragon born from an unknown egg.<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t draw the ‘Dragon Knight’ card, so he was not eligible.<br/><br/>But it seemed that when he obtained two items, he would be given a sort of quest.<br/><br/>‘But 5,000 days? 5,000 days means 13 years?’<br/><br/>  </div><h2 id="chapter53">Chapter 53</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Waiting for that long would be ridiculous. However, he thought he could shorten the hatching time of the egg greatly by killing stronger enemies, as well as hunting more and more. In that respect, it seemed that his power was limited now.<br/><br/>But one thing was certain.<br/><br/>‘Muscle strength increased by six? Jackpot!’<br/><br/>‘If this is true, doesn’t it mean that my physical ability increases just by wearing an item?’<br/><br/>And the sword did not seem to break easily. In fact, Sungwoo felt that he needed a more powerful item after his saber was broken while he was brandishing it against the vampires.<br/><br/>He carried the sword on his back and put the ‘unknown egg’ deep into the bag.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, after clearing the dungeon, Sungwoo’s party was collecting necessary items from the shopping mall. Although the mall was ravaged by the Kobolds, they could still find something useful in the rubble.<br/><br/>At that moment, a vibration rang in Sungwoo’s pocket.<br/><br/>Woowoong!<br/><br/>He immediately pulled out his cell phone. It showed a pop-up window on the thread that he posted on the community bulletin.<br/><br/>─ Rider A (secret): Captain, I found a secret comment function, so I’m using it now.<br/><br/>I’m at Haenggung Square in Hwaseong. Hundred or two hundred? We’ve all gathered here. But I can’t see the vampires. So, we’ll keep waiting!!! 300 gold is required for secret comments. So, prepare them for me in advance.<br/><br/>Rider A was Taesung. He infiltrated into the survivors gathered by the vampire group and decided to update Sungwoo. Given that Taesung managed to post a comment, it seemed that he was acting well according to Sungwoo’s plan.<br/><br/>“By the way, this guy’s grammar is…”<br/><br/>What Sungwoo got from the comment was that people were gathered at the Hwaseong Haenggung Square, and those who appeared to be ‘them’ or vampires were not visible yet. ‘Vampires may not appear in person. However, they may be chasing me.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo had been caught in the Vampire Lord’s curse, ‘Pursuit of Blood.’ Therefore, his location was exposed every 12 hours. In fact, 12 hours was long enough for Sungwoo to escape, but he couldn’t afford to be caught off guard. If they were determined enough to search the area here and follow the traces of hunting, he could be caught someday.<br/><br/>‘Of course, I don’t think I am going to be defeated anymore.’<br/><br/>Not long ago, he had to use all available skeletons to kill just one vampire.<br/><br/>Back then, the vampire was a very frightening object, let alone a difficult opponent.<br/><br/>But now the situation was different because Sungwoo had become much stronger than before.<br/><br/>He was confident enough to knock them down even if several vampires charged at him all at once.<br/><br/>At that moment Hanho called out, “Sungwoo, look here!”<br/><br/>It was the men’s restroom on the second floor where he shouted at Sungwoo. He hurriedly waved his hand as if he found something. There were a couple of Werewolf bodies.<br/><br/>“They lay down here. You were looking for them, right?”<br/><br/>“You bet.”<br/><br/>“Maybe you have luck among your hidden stats. Or a guardian angel killed these two and put a gift in the root instead of socks.”<br/><br/>Two dead Werewolves were hanging upside down on the tree roots.<br/><br/>Sungwoo wondered how the little Kobold skeletons caught these monsters. He thought that perhaps the Depraved Tree Spirit bound them with its roots one by one, and then the Kobold skeletons beat them dead. No matter how strong the Werewolves were, they would not have been able to escape the roots tightly wrapped around their bodies.<br/><br/>On the other hand, these were the items that Sungwoo had been looking for in this hunt because the ‘human animal’ skeletons like them were the best weapons Sungwoo could carry around.<br/><br/>“Good. I think you are pretty good at finding things just like a thief.”<br/><br/>“I’m not a thief, but a priest!”<br/><br/>“Well, the two have similar concepts in Korea, don’t they?”<br/><br/>“No, that’s a dangerous understatement. Don’t generalize those who preach faith with an unselfish mind!”<br/><br/>Shrugging, Sungwoo walked to the Werewolves’ bodies.<br/><br/>“Well, I’m supposed to resurrect the dead to fight the opponents.”<br/><br/>-The dead have become your subordinate under your authority.<br/><br/>-The dead have become your subordinate under your authority.<br/><br/>Currently, Sungwoo’s force was powerful with Right, five Werewolves, one Werebear, one vampire skeleton, four Kobold wizards, and three orcs.<br/><br/>“I think this is enough. Now, let’s move to Suwon Hwaseong.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t need to avoid the vampires.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Vampires were waiting in several buildings near the square visible to everyone.<br/><br/>There were 23 in total. The Vampire Lord sacrificed his blood to give them power.<br/><br/>Of course, the Vampire Lord could recover his exhausted blood by sucking a huge amount of blood, and he planned to increase the number of vampires in the future.<br/><br/>Seven vampires were waiting in the cafe on the second floor. They were already thrilled to run out immediately and take fresh blood from the square once the Vampire Lord issued the order.<br/><br/>“Oh, I’m bored…When will the table be set up…”<br/><br/>“Do you see that kid over there? He’s mine. A young kid’s blood tastes delicious like veal.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, suck his blood then. There’s a lot to eat there anyway.”<br/><br/>However, their excitement turned sour by an unexpected emergency.<br/><br/>“Be prepared to go out.”<br/><br/>“Uh? Ready to start the feast?”<br/><br/>“No, we are going to chase the guys who attacked the factory.”<br/><br/>The leader of this team, Chief Choi, was ordered by the Representative to catch and kill ‘that son of a bitch.<br/><br/>“Pardon? Didn’t the Representative say he would catch that guy after the great feast? He said we didn’t have to waste our energy before the big feast…”<br/><br/>Chief Choi tightened the strings of his shoes and even wore a hat on the table.<br/><br/>“The situation has changed. That guy is around here.”<br/><br/>“Is he here?”<br/><br/>“Why? The slaves we detained in the factory tipped them that we’re in control here?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know. It’s the Representative’s order. We have to catch and kill him before that bastard makes a mess around here.”<br/><br/>The team members stood up all at once at Choi’s urging.<br/><br/>“So, where is he now?”<br/><br/>As the Representative’s right-hand man, Choi knew that the Representative could check Sungwoo’s location for about five minutes every 12 hours.<br/><br/>“I heard he was hiding in a school. After all, he doesn’t know what kind of curse he has right now. That’s why his guard is down. So, let’s approach him quietly and behead him without failure.”<br/><br/>Seven vampires, including Chief Choi, headed to a nearby elementary school 15 minutes away. Soon they could find the traces of hunting around that area.<br/><br/>“It’s a Dire Wolf’s body. The claw marks are like those of a Werewolf, but given no traces of gnawing, it looks like that bastard’s skeletons killed it.”<br/><br/>“He’s definitely in there.”<br/><br/>They surrounded the elementary school building and gradually closed in on them.<br/><br/>When they entered the building, they could find the traces of their target in the hallway on the first floor.<br/><br/>“There are bloodstains. It smells like Dire Wolf blood. It looks like the blood came from the bones.”<br/><br/>Vampires with a highly-developed sense of smell could distinguish the various blood smells. Choi’s team, which was consistently expressionless, burst into laughter because their prey was a relatively easy target.<br/><br/>“How did the branch manager say the factory was attacked by this kind of weak guy? He must have let down his hair.”<br/><br/>“I guess so. By the way, it seems this bastard doesn’t know that if he leaves blood behind like this, it will attract a herd of monsters.”<br/><br/>At that moment, one of Choi’s men, who was searching the other side of the hall, shouted, “Look! Blood drops are over there. It’s the auditorium.”<br/><br/>It seemed there was no other exit in the auditorium.<br/><br/>“Okay, he’s doomed. Let’s kill him and his men all at once!”<br/><br/>Choi’s team seized up Sungwoo’s power to some extent. When the Vampire Lord possessed the branch manager briefly, he checked Sungwoo’s force and tipped Choi off on it.<br/><br/>Choi could infer a significant amount of information about him. He knew that Sungwoo was controlling skeletons, and it was the Werewolf skeleton in particular that he had to watch out for. </div><h2 id="chapter54">Chapter 54</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “The Representative said the guy had only five Werewolves as his main force. If so, we can beat him.”<br/><br/>As the second highest-ranking ‘master’ grade vampire after the Vampire Lord, Chief Choi was confident that he could confront two Werewolves at the same time. Therefore, he was confident of an easy victory.<br/><br/>They moved at the same time and grabbed the three soundproof doors in the auditorium to pry open them simultaneously. Some of the doors were locked, but they tore them off.<br/><br/>Crunch!<br/><br/>The seven vampires entered the auditorium. They found a man standing on the stage.<br/><br/>“Hey!” Chief Choi shouted, walking toward him. The man standing on the stage looked at him and stepped back with an embarrassed look.<br/><br/>Chief Choi laughed openly because the man looked so pitiful.<br/><br/>“Are you lost?”<br/><br/>Noticing him standing next to a goblin skeleton and two Werewolf skeletons, he was the very target he had been looking for. However, the skeletons were much smaller than he expected. Didn’t the Representative say that he had about ten skeletons? Well, it didn’t matter to Choi anyway.<br/><br/>“Where are all the skeletons? Lost them? Did you boil them and make meat because you had nothing to eat?”<br/><br/>The vampires giggled at Choi’s mocking. They approached him arrogantly, like a bully driving a helpless man into a corner.<br/><br/>“Hey, did you clean your neck? I see lots of guys with dirty necks.”<br/><br/>“Dirty neck? What does it matter? Isn’t it salty?”<br/><br/>“Haha! You must be a hardcore vampire.”<br/><br/>Holding their heads high, the vampires closed in on the man. He got more and more scary, which pleased them even more.<br/><br/>“Hey, look at his scared expression! Cute!”<br/><br/>Come to think of it, these vampires were not these kinds of humans. However, after they had their necks bitten by the Representative, they began to wake up to new senses and emotions they had never experienced before. And that was another source of happiness to them. Blood sucking, slaughtering, and violence became their essential needs.<br/><br/>In no time they crossed halfway through the auditorium. They were now close enough to bite the man’s neck within 3 seconds.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>At that moment however, the man’s expression changed furtively. He looked like he was crying at first, then wore a blank expression, and now he smiled at them, walking one step closer to them fearlessly.<br/><br/>“Ugh?”<br/><br/>The vampires clearly felt something strange, but didn’t notice why because there was nothing else for them to judge that the situation had changed. Maybe an ambush or surprise attack?<br/><br/>No way. It was a fat chance for a vampire with developed senses not to notice it.<br/><br/>Then the man commented, “…I thought you would come here.”<br/><br/>“What did you say?”<br/><br/>“Since I came near here, I thought you wouldn’t stand idle. You know, the dog keeping an eye on its bowl is the most sensitive and ferocious.”<br/><br/>When Chief Choi stopped, the other vampires stopped at once.<br/><br/>The man continued, “You still don’t know what my skill is. Good. I thought your Representative might have noticed it, but he didn’t when he possessed the branch manager.”<br/><br/>“…Skill? Are you talking about your ability to control the skeleton shits? It seems there are only three skeletons left. Where did you hide them?”<br/><br/>Saying that provocatively, Chief Choi felt somewhat nervous deep inside.<br/><br/>“It’s a little different.”<br/><br/>“…What?<br/><br/>Chief Choi swallowed unwittingly, then looked at his mouth.<br/><br/>“Well, my skill is not just about controlling the skeletons, but…”<br/><br/>At that moment, two messages appeared before Choi’s eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Caution! Fellblade begins in your area!<br/><br/>Caution! ‘Death Response’ begins in your area!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“In fact, I can use more powerful skills.”<br/><br/>Chief Choi instinctively turned back. Although he didn’t know exactly what was going on, he felt he had to get out of here. At that moment, however, the floor near the entrance turned into black mud, then several arms began to stretch out from the ground.<br/><br/>“Zombies?”<br/><br/>Chief Choi could not express them in any other way. What were obviously animal bodies began to crawl out from the floor. They were a little more eerie than the zombies he used to know. They had blue skin and purple eyes. Namely, they were not from this world.<br/><br/>While Choi and the other vampires were at a loss about what to do, the black smoke rose fast. Now they could not even see an inch in front of them in the auditorium.<br/><br/>“Ugh! What the heck is this!”<br/><br/>“Ahhhhh!”<br/><br/>The vampires became more and more helpless by inhaling the black smoke. They inevitably focused on hearing as their vision and sense of smell were blocked. Then some dreadful and creepy sound echoed everywhere.<br/><br/>Rattle, rattle, rattle.<br/><br/>Regardless of monsters and humans, they always misunderstand they’re numerically superior when they encounter the Necromancer for the first time.<br/><br/>“You guys didn’t know you were surrounded from the beginning, right?” the man shouted.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo and his friends began hunting the vampires in the dark.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They could be called something like the ‘Undead Unit.’<br/><br/>Actually, the synergy of  was in effect.<br/><br/>[Synergy list]<br/><br/>Squad Organization (Hidden)<br/> -Category: Synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: Commander (Stage 1) Trait: More than 11 normal members<br/><br/>-Effects: Attack Power (+5%), Defense Power (+5%)<br/><br/>Right had the trait of the commander (Stage 2).

                            “What? What the heck are you talking about?”<br/><br/>“…Explosion!”<br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>‘Body Explosion’ occurred in his both hands. The zombies that stopped moving were determined to be corpses, and thus he applied the Body Explosion. As a result, not only Choi’s hands but also his shoulders were completely ripped apart and blown away.<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>New bones began to sprout between the wounds, but Sungwoo immediately moved to stop his counterattack. Actually, Sungwoo knew how to respond in this situation, which he had learned while dealing with several vampires until now.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Three Werewolf skeletons jumped at him. Thanks to Synergy , they could enjoy a drastic increase in their muscle strength when attacking one opponent at the same time.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>Choi twisted his body, screaming, but since he was heavily injured, he could not outmuscle the Werewolf skeletons.<br/><br/>Crunch! Crunch!<br/><br/>Sungwoo ordered them to break his legs first. Choi could no longer resist or move.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the other vampires were completely eradicated. The auditorium was suddenly quiet. Only Choi moaned occasionally.<br/><br/>Sungwoo walked towards him and said, “Well, I guess your Representative appears before you to talk nonsense, or he may make you run wildly insanely. I don’t want it, of course.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo then pulled the sword, which was the ‘Masterless Black Sword’ that had belonged to the Dragon Knight.<br/><br/>“Do you think a shit like you can stop the Representative? He is great, great!” Choi shouted.<br/><br/>“How can you guys exalt him so much in only six days? Your brain needs to be opened for examination, I think.”<br/><br/>High-grade vampires acted as if they had fallen in love with the Vampire Lord.<br/><br/>“…so disgusting.”<br/><br/>Although Choi was the Representative’s subordinate like skeletons under Sungwoo’s authority, Sungwoo liked the obedient skeletons.<br/><br/>Crackle.<br/><br/>“How could you blame my Representative?”<br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/>Sungwoo stabbed his chest with the black sword right away. Although it didn’t inflict fatal damage because it didn’t recognize the owner, its blade penetrated into his heart mercilessly.<br/><br/>‘Nice blade.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo knew his muscle strength had increased by six, but at the same time he could immediately feel that this ‘black sword’ item was of excellent quality.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>With his heart pierced, he vomited a pool of blood before dropping his head.<br/><br/>-You have earned 20,000 gold by killing a special player.<br/><br/>The event paid off after all. He received 20,000 gold. In other words, he earned two gold roulettes. Besides, by beheading him, Sungwoo shortened the hatching time of the “unknown egg.”<br/><br/>-Time left until hatching: 4,949 days<br/><br/>Sungwoo heard that the hatching time would decrease when he killed more powerful enemies. Actually, when he beheaded the master grade vampire, the hatching time was advanced by 50 days. It seemed to be generous, but looking at the remaining time, the hatching time was still very far.<br/><br/>Standing in the middle of the killing scene, Sungwoo nullified the summoning of all the remaining orc skeletons. He felt attached to them for their great service until now, but it was time to part with them to further strengthen his forces. He resurrected four vampires and added them to his force.<br/><br/>-The dead have become your subordinate under your authority.<br/><br/>-‘Synergy’ effect is given due to team play.<br/><br/>[Synergy list]<br/><br/>Those who eat blood (Stage 1)<br/> -Category: Synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: 5 vampires<br/><br/>-Effect: Sucking blood when attacking (+2%), all stats increase in a ‘frenzied state’ right before being destroyed (+10%)<br/><br/>As a result, Sungwoo had the strongest possible deck.<br/><br/>Woowoong!<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s cell phone vibrated. It was a secret comment posted on Sungwoo’s thread.<br/><br/>─ kor-339 (secret): It’s me, Jisu. They started moving somewhere urgently. Even the so-called managers around us, who were relaxed until now, suddenly started to collect weapons from us urgently, saying it’s the condition for allowing us to enter into the Safety Zone. It looks like something will happen soon. Please reply.<br/><br/>Anticipating that the vampires would soon search for him, Sungwoo set a trap.<br/><br/>When a troublemaker was approaching to take the bait, it was impossible to not catch him. As expected, a swarm of mosquitoes were caught by the spiderwebs that Sungwoo set.<br/><br/>“No wonder they are in a chaotic situation now.”<br/><br/>On one hand, Sungwoo planted more reliable moles than Taesung, namely Hanho and Jisu. They blended in with the survivors that the vampires had lured at the Hwaseong Haenggung Square, and updated Sungwoo about the situation there. And the reason why the crowds in the square became impatient was simple.<br/><br/>“It’s because the Representative realized that his subordinates were all killed.”<br/><br/>The Representative felt that lots of vampires who chased Sungwoo until now were slaughtered at once. He knew he could not afford to stay relaxed anymore.<br/><br/>“The tables have turned.”<br/><br/>It was the moment when the chasers and fugitives reversed roles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Survivors in shabby clothes gathered at Hwaseong Haenggung Square, where the citizens once spent their leisure, one of the first, magnificent cultural heritage sites in Suwon. All the traffic noise on the wide roads disappeared completely, and only those who survived breathed nervously.<br/><br/>“Look at that over there.”<br/><br/>“Damn it, why did they hang it like that?”<br/><br/>There was a large placard hanging on the wall of Suwon iPark Municipal Art Museum, located next to the square. The placard advertised an artist’s exhibition, but the letters were invisible because the placard was stained with blood. The victims were hung from the roof.<br/><br/>“I don’t know what happened, but it’s just unbelievable that the monster caught them.”<br/><br/>“You bet. I saw that monster killing a big wolf. How did he catch them?”<br/><br/>Four Werewolves were stuck and hung on the spears. The grotesque bodies of the Werewolves were clearly intended to show off the force of those who gathered the survivors.<br/><br/>“Jisu, it’s our turn next. I’ve hidden a dagger on my thigh.”<br/><br/>Jisu and Hanho were mixed in with the crowds. About 200 gathered in the square, and as players, they were holding weapons that matched their jobs. But the people in the Safety Zone demanded they submit their weapons for control and safety reasons. Their demands looked reasonable, but there was a wicked plot hidden behind such demands.<br/><br/>“Hanho, look at the entrance to the museum on the right.”<br/><br/>“…I think I recognize who they are.”<br/><br/>“Yeah. The vampires hiding there seem to be crawling out now.”<br/><br/>Fifteen people were coming out from the direction that she pointed to. She immediately felt they were vampires. They came out so naturally that they were far from the survivors who took pains to come to the Safety Zone. Besides, it was very suspicious that all of them were wearing masks.<br/><br/>‘They are wearing masks to hide their canines.’<br/><br/>In no time a man who controlled the survivors was seen rushing toward them.<br/><br/>Seeing him, Jisu and Hanho became convinced they were definitely vampires.<br/><br/>“Does it make any sense? Don’t you know how many I sent them? Why are all of them defeated like that? Stupid!”<br/><br/>One of them in particular stood out conspicuously. He was wearing glasses in a beige suit, but only he was dressed up. He was shouting at his colleagues in a fit of anger. Given that he didn’t care about the survivors in the square, he was obviously the crazy Representative that Sungwoo mentioned.<br/><br/>‘That bastard is the main culprit of this incident.’<br/><br/>Jisu secretly hid the ‘Ignition Whetstone’ in a flower bed at the edge of the square.<br/><br/>Then she submitted the other weapons as demanded. Therefore, about 200 survivors, including Jisu and Han, became fully disarmed.<br/><br/>Staying empty-handed in this hellish world made them feel nervous and uncomfortable. They waited only for time to enter the Safety Zone anxiously. But there were only a few who knew they would never have such an opportunity.<br/><br/>“They’re beginning to surround us.”<br/><br/>“Damn it. I wish Sungwoo could arrive quickly.”<br/><br/>About 30 members, including 15 vampires, began to stand at the edges of Haenggung Square in a move to broadly surround the survivors. At first glance, they seemed to protect the disarmed survivors, but they were watching the survivors with their greedy eyes.<br/><br/>“Now, pay attention!”<br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, the man in a beige suit came forward. The survivors shut their mouths and turned their heads.<br/><br/>“Uh, so… humans stopped evolving!” </div><h2 id="chapter56">Chapter 56</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            As soon as the survivors began to feel suspicious at his unexpected statement, he continued, “What do you think about this disaster-like ordeal? Why did it happen? Does anyone want to reply?…Ugh? No?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“No? That’s why you can’t do anything. And that is why you are destined to be the scapegoats of evolution!”<br/><br/>The survivors began to whisper nervously here and there because he didn’t show any intention of opening the Safety Zone to them.<br/><br/>“What the hell is this crazy bastard talking about? Jisu, I’m holding a knife now.”<br/><br/>Jisu also stood next to the flower bed where she hid the sword. Then, the vampires surrounding the survivors began to take off their masks. They were smacking their lips, with their mouths curled up.<br/><br/>In the meantime, members of the vampire gang, who appeared to be regular players, not vampires, began to put long sticks at the edges of the square at regular intervals.<br/><br/>The survivors could not figure out what they were doing, but they were very nervous now.<br/><br/>“And the one who will be chosen for evolution are none other than…”<br/><br/>He opened both hands and pointed to his men.<br/><br/>“We all! We will run the future! Now… Cheers!”<br/><br/>Cheers? The moment Jisu and Hanho were puzzled by that weird toast, they began to shout.<br/><br/>“Haha! Let’s enjoy the meal!”<br/><br/>“Thanks for the meal!”<br/><br/>“I like a white neck!”<br/><br/>“Hey, you over there! You have been making eye contact with me until now.”<br/><br/>Mad vampires began to jump at the survivors all over the place. Jisu picked up the sword hidden in the flowerbed right away.<br/><br/>Crackle! Crackle!<br/><br/>It was the moment when the identity of the rods installed on the edges of the square was revealed. An electric current flowed between the rods. It was kind of like an electric fence, but it wasn’t available on the market. Obviously it was obtained from ‘other items.’<br/><br/>So, the survivors were surrounded by the vampire predators, trapped in a fence.<br/><br/>Without any weapons, it was impossible for them to confront the predators.<br/><br/>“Oh my God! What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>“What happened? Ahhh!”<br/><br/>Frightened, the survivors stepped back all at once. However, there was no place for them to escape because of the electric fencing. The vampires approached them at full speed, drooling as if competing for delicious side dishes. Jisu breathed out roughly, holding the sabre with both hands.<br/><br/>“Come on, baby! Come to me!”<br/><br/>The vampire at the forefront was tall. He rushed towards a young child rapidly.<br/><br/>Woowoong!<br/><br/>However, the first thing he met was a shuttle bus with a university logo.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The bus, which hit the vampire, stopped suddenly between the survivors and the other vampires. The survivors moved back in chaos at the unexpected development, and the vampires also stopped in embarrassment.<br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, with the sound of air pressure being released, the front door of the bus was opened. And someone got off.<br/><br/>“…Look at that shit!”<br/><br/>Watching him, the man in a beige suit also walked forward.<br/><br/>He smiled a forced smile, “I thought you would be late, but you’re here on time. We didn’t even enjoy the appetizer yet. Oh, let’s enjoy the party together. Okay?”<br/><br/>Then he opened his hands and pointed at the vampires around him.<br/><br/>They threatened him, revealing their sharp teeth. However, the man who got off the bus, namely Sungwoo, asked back without being scared at all, “Really? Then I think I have to teach you party manners first.”<br/><br/>When he said that, the man in a beige suit, the Vampire Lord, wore a stiff look. But he smiled once again.<br/><br/>“…Uh? Manners? Hahaha! How humorous! It’s a pity I couldn’t make you mine. So, what’s the party etiquette you have in mind?”<br/><br/>“The party should start with firecrackers.”<br/><br/>“Huh? What?”<br/><br/>At that moment, a Werewolf skeleton landed behind the Vampire Lord. It jumped off from the rooftop of a nearby building. However, he laughed leisurely without looking back as if he had noticed the skeleton.<br/><br/>“Oh, this is your trick? It’s not funny at all.”<br/><br/>He shrugged because he knew he could easily knock down a Werewolf even if he was ambushed. In fact, the Werewolves hanging on the spears of the museum roof were caught by him. But he didn’t notice what the Werewolf skeleton behind him was doing now.<br/><br/>“I liked the explosion.”<br/><br/>The Werewolf skeleton was holding lots of goblin bodies in both hands.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>With a fairly powerful explosion, the Vampire Lord disappeared into the smoke.<br/><br/>“Now, this is the beginning of the real party.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his friends now began to hunt the vampires for the second time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Representative!”<br/><br/>With the massive explosion, Vampire Road disappeared into the smoke.<br/><br/>“Damn it! He will be alright. So, get rid of that bastard!”<br/><br/>An executive who seemed to be a master shouted at his fellow vampires.<br/><br/>Then they started attacking Sungwoo from all directions. However, Sungwoo was still relaxed, not embarrassed at all.<br/><br/>“You guys are evolving?”<br/><br/>Kyongsu, who drove the bus here, already fled early, and Sungwoo also disappeared behind the bus.<br/><br/>“Why are you running away?”<br/><br/>“Do you think I can’t catch you when you are hiding there?”<br/><br/>“Surround the bus!”<br/><br/>The vampires scattered widely and began to close in on Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Five of them approached the bus right away. They got on the ceiling of the bus and moved back and forth on the bus. Obviously they were trying to stop him from escaping through the dead spot. However, the moment they reconfirmed him, they felt something very strange.<br/><br/>“Ugh?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was hiding behind a Werebear skeleton about 20 steps away from the bus.<br/><br/>But his appearance looked like a cover.<br/><br/>“How come you are talking about evolution when you don’t have even basic learning skills?”<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>The five vampires were instantly smashed into pieces by the bus.<br/><br/>Actually the bus wasn’t just there for a breakthrough purpose, but it was like a gunpowder box full of corpses. Without knowing it, the vampires ran to the bus via the shortest route and turned into ashes. Of course, it was part of Sungwoo’s operation plan.<br/><br/>“Ugh! Damn it! What the heck!”<br/><br/>“Wake up, everybody! Now is the chance to attack him! He’s got only one skeleton!”<br/><br/>The vampires did not give up. Since they were standing in the middle of the square where there was no place to hide, they could not afford to delay. They had to defeat Sungwoo right away.<br/><br/>The vampires approached them simultaneously from three directions except for the burning bus.<br/><br/>“So far, you’ve managed to survive, but you can’t run away!”<br/><br/>When they thought they drove him into a completely dead alley, Sungwoo used the powerful skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Caution! ‘Fellblade’ has begun in your area!<br/><br/>Caution! ‘Death Response’ has begun in your area!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo murmured with the black smoke spreading everywhere. It was true that he had already experienced the same scene several times. But the enemies were hit hard by this familiar attack every time.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhh! What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>“Calm down! First, cough…”<br/><br/>However, since it was outdoors this time, the smoke quickly disappeared. And the white bones that appeared behind the black tent like ghosts began to move.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>The attack was started by the Kobold Wizard skeletons, a new addition to Sungwoo’s force.<br/><br/>They gave off green flames.<br/><br/>Pooh! Pop! Pop!<br/><br/>“Kahaaaaa! Put down the fire!”<br/><br/>The flying flames were slow, but they expected the skeletons would suddenly appear in the smoke and shoot flames like that.<br/><br/>Two vampires struggled in the flames, while others had no choice but to stop the assault and retreat.<br/><br/>“There is the wizard! Target the wizard!”<br/><br/>“…How???”<br/><br/>No wonder they asked how because a huge number of undead were gathering around the four wizard skeletons. When the vampires were at a loss about what to do, the wizards that just finished the rituals fired the flames again.<br/><br/>“Avoid them!”<br/><br/>Now the four Werewolf skeletons rushed toward the vampires who were running around wildly.<br/><br/>‘One by one.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo had them kill the individual vampire separated from the main group one by one, for it was much easier to destroy them individually.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>The four Werewolf Commandos charged at the vampire separated from his group at tremendous speed, attacking him all at once. </div><h2 id="chapter57">Chapter 57</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “Ahhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>It took only a dozen seconds for the herd of giant beasts to crush the single target out of shape.<br/><br/>“They are his main force! Let’s attack them together!” shouted the other vampires.<br/><br/>They soon changed their strategy. Instead of being defeated individually, they decided to confront the Werewolf skeletons as a group. They thought if they killed the skeletons, Sungwoo’s defense line would be broken.<br/><br/>“Good. Now is the time!”<br/><br/>But it was their misjudgment, for the ‘vampire skeletons’ which were waiting in the rear started moving. When the enemies gathered together in one place, Sungwoo’s skeletons began to spread widely in all directions. Besides, the ten zombies widened their formation and closed in on them. Now the situation has changed.<br/><br/>“Damn it! This time they’re attacking from behind!”<br/><br/>“They’re charging from the side too!”<br/><br/>They were under siege now because of their hasty wrong move.<br/><br/>“Too many enemies!”<br/><br/>“Stand back to back!”<br/><br/>In the confused fight, the strength of those who were besieged and those who besieging was overwhelmingly favorable to the latter. Those besieging can attack more swiftly and comprehensively. The vampire skeletons were holding bone daggers in both hands.<br/><br/>Given that their nails were already strong weapons, it was obvious why Sungwoo had them grab the daggers.<br/><br/>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!<br/><br/>Their bone daggers rained down on the vampires, followed by the green flames.<br/><br/>While moving here and there in confusion to avoid their attack from a long distance, the vampires were exposed to the first attack by the skeletons that closed in on them immediately.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>“Fight to the end!”<br/><br/>“No! We should get out of here!”<br/><br/>When both camps clashed like that, there was another difference between their strength.<br/><br/>In other words, there was no centralized command from the vampires.<br/><br/>“How should we get out of here? If we disperse here, we’re going to be crushed individually. We have to fight as a group here!”<br/><br/>“Crazy! I’m going to escape alone!”<br/><br/>“No!”<br/><br/>The vampires were weak compared to the skeletons that moved only at Sungwoo’s orders without any will, emotions, or fear.<br/><br/>The vampires could not stay united in the collective turmoil, and thus some of them began to break away from the camp.<br/><br/>“I am determined to survive. I need to suck blood!”<br/><br/>After all, one vampire broke through the skeletons and fled, with its face burned and a bone dagger stuck on his back. He was running somewhere, gasping for breath.<br/><br/>“Blood! Blood! Fresh blood!”<br/><br/>He was running in the direction of a group of survivors. He already bled a lot.<br/><br/>So, he couldn’t hold back the urge to suck blood instinctively. He thought he could recover quickly after sucking blood.<br/><br/>Right at that moment, however, someone walked out of the survivors. It was a woman in a red sweatshirt.<br/><br/>“Oh! I love that pretty woman’s neck!”<br/><br/>He extended his hands forward and opened his mouth wide. He felt thrilled at the thought of sticking his teeth into her white neck. However, she disappeared before his eyes instantly.<br/><br/>“Ugh?”<br/><br/>And he saw his hands cut, scattering into the air. He felt dizzy, bleeding.<br/><br/>He suspected he was seeing things because he lacked blood. At that moment, he rolled his pupils down the silver trajectory. And there he found a woman holding a saber. The trajectory originated from the blade. She bowed, then jumped to wield the sword.<br/><br/>The next moment, his neck fell off.<br/><br/>“Whew…” Jisu dusted the blood off the blade.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Sungwoo was on the verge of annihilating the vampires.<br/><br/>The Werewolf skeletons were grabbing the last vampire’s neck tightly.<br/><br/>“Cough! Cough!”<br/><br/>Crunch!<br/><br/>His neck was bent, and that was it.<br/><br/>“Are we all done now?” Jisu asked.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo shook his head, and then looked at the burning bus. To be precise, he was on alert for something behind the bus. Silence ensued for a moment.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>Soon, the bus, shaken by the impact, began to tilt sideways amid a tremendous explosion.<br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/>The bus fell and the flames burning the inner seats blazed everywhere. Then a man jumped over the bus and landed in front of Sungwoo. He was none other than the Vampire Lord.<br/><br/>“Uhhhhh…”<br/><br/>His whole body melted, and his beige suit was completely pressed against the skin.<br/><br/>He was holding someone on his side who looked like his subordinate. The next moment he lifted the man high in the air and sank his teeth into his neck.<br/><br/>Then he started sucking his subordinate’s blood. The man’s eyes were bloodshot as if blood were flowing out.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh…”<br/><br/>But the Vampire Lord pushed his teeth deeper in without caring at all. The man’s loosened neck began to tear off little by little. Nevertheless, the man was smiling.<br/><br/>“Representative, please carry out your mission…”<br/><br/>Eventually his neck was cut off, and the Vampire Lord, who sucked all his blood, raised the man’s head.<br/><br/>“Oh, Ughhhhhh…”<br/><br/>Then he made an eerie moan as if he was being stretched.<br/><br/>Crunch! Crunch!<br/><br/>Then projection-like things started popping out of his back and arms. Just like the branch manager did, he was now showing his true colors. Then he rolled his eyes towards Sungwoo and shouted, “Haaaa…do you remember what I told you before?”<br/><br/>“How can I remember what a garrulous bastard like you said?”<br/><br/>“Do you remember all the horses?”<br/><br/>“I told you I would give you a piece of my mind…You still remember it? If not, let me repeat it for the last time.”<br/><br/>Then he stuck out his long tongue and smacked his lips.<br/><br/>“…You’re done for!”<br/><br/>“It sucks, man!”<br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, the skeletons and zombies stood in front of Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Fuck you! Remove these shits from me!”<br/><br/>Then he charged at them. But one of the vampire skeletons swung his arm towards his side.<br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/>However, it was the skeleton that was hit by his arm. With tremendous reflex and resilience, he quickly turned his upper body and punched the skeleton’s chin.<br/><br/>‘Storm him!’<br/><br/>In fact, the first vampire skeleton was like a bait. Sungwoo was very good at seizing the chance when the opponent showed his weakness while taking the bait.<br/><br/>This time, a couple of vampire skeletons attacked him from both sides. However, Sungwoo was stunned by what happened next. The Vampire Lord suddenly stopped moving and swung his arms violently. The two skeletons were smashed in an instant.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Although the Kobold wizards shot green flames at him randomly, none of them hit him.<br/><br/>He narrowed the distance with Sungwoo while avoiding the attacks. Sungwoo now became nervous.<br/><br/>‘If I let my guard down by mistake, he will smash my head.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo sent out the Werewolf skeletons this time. However, he saved the Werebear because the Vampire Lord could attack him instead of the Werewolf.<br/><br/>‘The Werewolf is different because its muscle strength will go up with the synergistic effect of Cerberus when attacking a single enemy.’<br/><br/>When he confronted the branch manager, three Werewolf skeletons crushed him with their muscle strength. However, Sungwoo’s expectations were crushed immediately.<br/><br/>Although the four skeletons jumped at him and pressed his body altogether, their massive bones began to wobble when he twisted his body violently. Wobble. Now they were staggering, and the bones of their shins that supported their weight started cracking.<br/><br/>‘Damn it. I need a different strategy,’ Sungwoo murmured.<br/><br/>Soon, his skin swelled for a moment. Then he spread red smoke all over the place.<br/><br/>Pop!<br/><br/>The Werewolves quickly fell all over the place. It was his active skill.<br/><br/>He vaporized his blood and pumped it out with strong pressure. While the Werewolves were hesitating, he immediately attacked them.<br/><br/>One Werewolf’s skull fell behind Sungwoo’s back. After blowing away one skull, he kicked the other skeleton into the ceiling of the burning bus.<br/><br/>‘Step back.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo inevitably withdrew the Werewolf skeletons because if he lost them, he could not have another chance of storming the Vampire Lord.<br/><br/>Instead, Sungwoo dispatched another skeleton.<br/><br/>Crackle, crackle. It was Right.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this? Goblin? Hahaha! Is this what you are left with now?”<br/><br/>The Vampire Lod laughed, shrugging in a bizarre manner.<br/><br/>“Hey, it’s the boss of skeletons. Nobody survives after ignoring Right.<br/><br/>The Vampire Lord laughed it off and walked briskly toward Right.<br/><br/>Then he lifted his hand and hit Right on the head as if clocking a kid with his knuckles. </div><h2 id="chapter58">Chapter 58</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            However, Right lifted the blade, timed with his action.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>The 88% probability of  was correct again this time. His body staggered after slipping from the blade. At that moment, Right threw a glass bottle that it was hiding behind its back towards his face.<br/><br/>Puk! Cheeeee!<br/><br/>Then Right leaned forward and slipped back after cutting his ankle.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhhh! What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>“Hey, that was the last bottle, Right! Good job!” Sungwoo shouted jokingly.<br/><br/>The last bottle of Elder Slime’s acidic liquid was thrown on his face.<br/><br/>“Damn it! You dirty son of a bitch!”<br/><br/>“You guys are crushed out of shape by this every time! We made mincemeat of that stupid branch manager with this, too.”<br/><br/>“Ahhhhh! I’ll kill you!”<br/><br/>He rubbed his face hard and stepped back. That acidic liquid melted his corneas and blocked his vision. But his resilience was so good that his vision began to come back soon.<br/><br/>“…Ugh?”<br/><br/>Didn’t his vision completely return? He was seeing things. Obviously he saw four Werewolf skeletons, and he had killed one of them. But he definitely had not seen as many as seven. And four of them were holding long spears, which was familiar to him too. Just in case, he looked up at the rooftop of the museum. His prey that was supposed to be hanging there was missing.<br/><br/>“No way…”<br/><br/>Aside from the four vampire skeletons that the Vampire Lord crushed, there were four Werewolf skeletons.<br/><br/>“Damn it.”<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Seven Werewolf skeletons charged at him. Two got stuck on his back and two were flying toward his head. They were holding long spears in their hands. They stabbed the spears into his chest vertically.<br/><br/>Puk! Puk!<br/><br/>The spears pierced through his chest.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>His body swelled once again. Obviously he tried to vaporize his blood and blow off the sticky stuff on his body.<br/><br/>Pop!<br/><br/>But he didn’t this time. The seven Werewolves placed their teeth all over his body and pushed their claws between each other’s bones in a circle to nullify his blow. Their bodies shook several times with some of their ribs smashed, but that was it.<br/><br/>Crunch!<br/><br/>The Werewolf skeletons bound the Vampire Lord’s body tightly. He would certainly shake off his bondage at the slightest sign of loosening, so they could not do anything but hold him tightly.<br/><br/>At that moment, however, a bunch of zombies began to move toward him. Each of them was carrying something on their shoulders. They were the vampire bodies.<br/><br/>“Didn’t I tell you that the start of the party was a firecracker? The highlight of the party is the barbecue, isn’t it?”<br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo said that, his face, seen through the bones, turned pale.<br/><br/>“No, I hate this!”<br/><br/>“You guys have gathered here in one place. I wish I could take pictures of you. Explode!”<br/><br/>There was a huge explosion. Standing behind the Werebear skeleton’s back, he avoided the scattering bones and flesh.<br/><br/>And in the next moment, various messages appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/>-You have earned 10,000 gold by killing a special player.<br/><br/>10,000 gold? But this was not all.<br/><br/>-You have pursued the special quest,  (You have been successful in killing the assassin targeting your life!)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rewards have been given. (30,000 gold, C grade item ticket)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have pursued the exclusive quest ‘Death Coordinator’ in ‘salvation’ mode.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rewards have been given. (Exclusive skill)<br/><br/>Your fate changes subtly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The boss raid is worth it!” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>And hundreds of survivors in the square witnessed the boss raid.<br/><br/>“It’s fortunate that the man won, right? He was controlling something like monsters. Is he okay?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know what it is, but I’m sure he saved us.”<br/><br/>“You bet. I think so.”<br/><br/>Those survivors who were in danger of being massacred looked at their victorious savior.<br/><br/>Their expressions reflected not only embarrassment and relief, but also some sort of vague admiration.<br/><br/>“That’s him! ID 157 I mentioned! ID 157, it’s me!”<br/><br/>“Ugh? That thief hunter who posted the No. 1 thread? Really?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m so relaxed now…”<br/><br/>The repercussions of his victory were fundamentally different from his crackdown on the vampires in the H Apartments. This time, not one or two but quite a few survivors who witnessed his brilliant activities began to spread the news. They posted numerous threads that an unidentified man in the Suwon area cracked down on the wicked gang.<br/><br/>And there was unexpected development after his stories popped up on the community bulletin.<br/><br/>“Uh? Who are they?”<br/><br/>“…Soldiers?”<br/><br/>People in military uniforms poured out of one building as if on cue. They were wearing army combat uniforms, but they were armed with swords and shields, bows and crossbows, without any bulletproof gear. But their leader with the commander’s insignia was familiar to Sungwoo. He approached Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Hi, I was really curious about who fought such a great battle here. I never expected I would meet you again.”<br/><br/>“Sergeant Kim?”<br/><br/>It was Sergeant Kim, the soldier Sungwoo met on the road to Suyeong Intersection.<br/><br/>Sungwoo parted with him after trading his intelligence for stamina potions, but he met the soldier again.<br/><br/>“Yes. Thanks to your help, I’ve survived like this.”<br/><br/>“Why are you here?”<br/><br/>“I was spying on those who said they would create a Safety Zone. However, I never thought that such a ridiculous situation would unfold here. By the way, I’m sorry to say this, but there are people who want to meet you.”<br/><br/>“Who?”<br/><br/>What Sergeant Kim said was so absurd.<br/><br/>“The army is still intact.”<br/><br/>The force of the past summoned the force of the present.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was nothing like the Safety Zone in Suwon Hwaseong from the beginning.<br/><br/>Quite a few people were here, chasing after the illusions of the Safety Zone that did not exist. Even after Sungwoo posted a thread to warn them, some survivors of the abandoned factory posted threads exposing the vampires. Someone might have made a different choice after reading the threads, but over 200 people who visited this place ignored Sungwoo’s warning and came here with a ray of hope and illusions. They were so desperate and nervous at that time.<br/><br/>It was fortunate that Sungwoo saved them from their worst choice.<br/><br/>Night fell. The survivors decided to spend the night at the city museum that the vampires used as their hideout. It was spacious enough to accommodate about 200 people.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was at the factory manager’s office there.<br/><br/>“Profile.”<br/><br/>[Player profile]<br/><br/>-Name: Sungwoo Yu<br/><br/>-Level: 10<br/><br/>-Occupation: Necromancer, Black wizard<br/><br/>-Stats: Muscle Strength (8+6), Agility (8), Stamina (5),<br/><br/>-Gold Reserve: 298,880<br/><br/>-Additional Trait: Demon<br/><br/>Of the total 300,000 gold, 150,000 gold was obtained from the battle that just ended. Sungwoo earned more gold than he did after massacring a group of Kobolds in the dungeon and hunting all kinds of monsters on the streets. That was not all.<br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/>-Name: Bone Armor Production<br/><br/>-Grade: Basic<br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/>-Consumption: 10 mana<br/><br/>*Body bones are used to make armor. Armor is worn as soon as it’s made. The results vary depending on the type and quality of the material, and the higher the skill level, the more elaborate the armor.<br/><br/>It was the skill that Sungwoo gained through the exclusive quest. He felt like it was like a defense armor version of Bone Weapon Formation. When the skill was used, the armor was made using nearby bodies as materials, and then it was attached to the body automatically.<br/><br/>Tap, tap.<br/><br/>Sungwoo knocked on the bone armor attached to his chest. Since it was made in a size that fit his body perfectly, he felt like he had additional ribs attached. Since skeletons could wear this armor, he thought he could look forward to much stronger defensive power.<br/><br/>Then Sungwoo lifted a large crossbow on the desk. He obtained it from the class C box, which he got by completing a special quest to remove the killer.<br/><br/>[Item Information]<br/><br/>-Name: Dwarf Repeating Crossbow<br/><br/>-Rating: Hero<br/><br/>-Category: Crossbow<br/><br/>-Effect: Equipped with a magazine connected to the armory in the subspace.

                            Of course, even if I obtained bows or crossbows, it didn’t mean I would no longer need spears or daggers. Strictly speaking, these weapons had different uses. In the battle, the skeleton frequently engages in hand-to-hand fight combat after a momentary confrontation.<br/><br/>Throwing a dagger can be useful, for you can throw a volley of handy daggers at the enemy before replacing them with another weapon right away while the enemy has not yet noticed it.<br/><br/>In fact, Sungwoo, who did not directly step into the frontline but mainly commanded the skeletons in the rear, needed these weapons to fight enemies at a distance.<br/><br/>Today he truly saw a dramatic increase in his defense power. After tonight, however, he would probably have another problem. That night he dreamed after a long time. In the dream, he was a powerless presence unlike today. He was facing a huge fire. And he couldn’t do anything when his family screamed in the fire and begged for help.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, Sungwoo!”<br/><br/>“…?”<br/><br/>He could see Hanho’s face.<br/><br/>“Sergeant Kim is looking for you. The soldiers you saw yesterday have come.”<br/><br/>It seemed that he got in trouble again today. Those soldiers who were lurking in nearby buildings appeared right after Sungwoo killed the Vampire Lord yesterday. Then Sergeant Kim, who was familiar to Sungwoo, appeared, saying that the army was alive.<br/><br/>“Could you come with me to my unit?”<br/><br/>But Sungwoo shook his head at Kim’s request.<br/><br/>“Sorry. Please tell them if there is anything I can do for them, just come and see me.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo had no reason to see them, nor did he want to travel a long distance for those who he didn’t know well. Besides, his fatigue had piled after the long fight, so he didn’t want to perform even small acts of kindness. After all, Sergeant Kim said that he would convey his message. Then the next morning a high-ranking military officer came to see him very early.<br/><br/>Sungwoo got up from the sofa and sat down on the desk chair.<br/><br/>“Tell him to wait a little.”<br/><br/>“Oh, are you sure? He seems to have an ill temper…”<br/><br/>“Well, his temper is not his level, man.”<br/><br/>“You bet. Okay, then.”<br/><br/>Soldiers? Sungwoo didn’t think the army, which had been in existence for decades, would collapse so easily. Although military discipline was allegedly breaking down, the army was a group that continued to train in preparation for national emergencies such as war.<br/><br/>Of course, this game-like situation was not in the army’s manual. Moreover, all weapons had been disabled, and the military command system was in disarray.<br/><br/>Tramp ― Tramp ―<br/><br/>“This way?”<br/><br/>“I’m sorry, but he wants you to wait a little more…”<br/><br/>Someone’s voice was heard outside the door. Hanho tried to ask for his understanding with an embarrassed voice, but the other party didn’t seem to listen to him.<br/><br/>“Wait? I don’t have time to wait now. Do you think this situation is a joke? Step aside.”<br/><br/>The door of the manager’s office was flung open, along with the middle-aged man’s voice. Sungwoo, who was rubbing his eyes sleepily, saw the man with a lieutenant colonel rank. A captain and Sergeant Kim were standing behind him. Meeting Sungwoo’s eyes, Kim expressed his regrets with a frown.<br/><br/>“Are you the man I want to see?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“I am Lieutenant Colonel Taeryong Park of the 51st Army Division.”<br/><br/>Park sat on a leather sofa. The captain and Kim stood against the wall.<br/><br/>“You know I’ve come a long way to see you, so let me get to the point right away.”<br/><br/>It seemed that Park was trying to blame him for his long journey instead of accepting his request.<br/><br/>“Please go ahead,” said Sungwoo, sitting across him on a leather sofa.<br/><br/>“I heard that you killed the monsters in Hwaseong Haenggung that put us on alert. I would like to hear your testimony about the incident, and ask for your help.”<br/><br/>“Well, I have no problem testifying, but what do you mean you want to ask for my help?”<br/><br/>After pausing for a moment and thinking about what to say, Park parted his thick lips, “Join the army.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo burst into a smile unconsciously.<br/><br/>“Oh my God! That’s a suggestion that would shock 99% of Korean men.”<br/><br/>“I understand. But you know my suggestion is not a joke, right?”<br/><br/>Park’s eyebrows wriggled. It was evident that the army, led by him, came to him to get something, or subject him to them. It was clear from the beginning that Park intended to break his spirit with the strong image of the army. If Sungwoo backed down here, he would have to wage an unnecessary war of nerves with Park.<br/><br/>“Why should I accept your suggestion? It’s so ridiculous that I can’t understand it.”<br/><br/>How could Park ask Sungwoo to join the army all of a sudden? Who could welcome such an absurd idea? But Park’s face was still stiff.<br/><br/>“Well, I hope you understand that my suggestion is not only legitimate, but also helpful to you.”<br/><br/>“Helpful?”<br/><br/>“This is a national emergency. It is impossible to declare martial law, and in fact everybody is under martial law, so it is quite legitimate for the army to recruit a strong man like you. However, I recognize your performance, so I would like to treat you with respect.”<br/><br/>Obviously, in this emergency, if the government was functioning, it would issue the mobilization order as soon as it declared martial law, and the army would fight the monsters.<br/><br/>However, what was happening was the opposite. The government wasn’t functioning from the very beginning, and the army lost all their weapons. And it took too long for them to wake up to the new reality.<br/><br/>“Then what do you want me to do?”<br/><br/>“I want you to help us while we are trying to come up with an emergency response, national restoration, and system safety.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“Haa…I hear your name is Sungwoo Yu? You must have military experience, so I think you understand what I mean. Don’t dismiss my suggestion as nonsense.”<br/><br/>Park rubbed his face with his palm and softened his tone further. Was he trying to appeal to him emotionally?<br/><br/>“In this ridiculous situation, it’s imperative that the people should stay united, but a guy like Youngdungpo Prosecutor has denied the government and declared that he would create an independent puppet group. You already know that, right?”<br/><br/>“Yes, I know.”<br/><br/>From the military’s point of view, they had no choice but to take such a declaration by the Youngdungpo Prosecutor seriously.<br/><br/>“Don’t you think this is a very deplorable situation? The people must be united around the army to solve the situation. A man like you can become a South Korean soldier and a hero. There’s going to be a terrible thing that you can’t even imagine, starting from Gwanghwamun…”<br/><br/>He suddenly shut his mouth tightly.<br/><br/>‘Gwanghwamun? What is he trying to say?’<br/><br/>Did he call him a hero? In some respects, he had a point. But he didn’t understand the ongoing situation at all.<br/><br/>“No, I don’t think so. Puppet group? Do you have any grounds for saying that?”<br/><br/>“What did you say?”<br/><br/>“When this happened, many people were looking for help from the government and the military. While waiting for their help, they were killed by the monsters. Some of them survived and they are joining hands for survival now.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“But I don’t support people like Yongdungpo Prosecutor. But at least they seemed to have adapted to this system.”<br/><br/>“System?”<br/><br/>“As you know, this phenomenon follows the gaming method. Monsters appear, items are given, and quests are created. And most of the quests are given to individuals under certain conditions. In other words, these are not the kinds of problems that the country or the military can solve.”<br/><br/>This game was bound to break human society into pieces thoroughly. A survival struggle was taking place, and everybody must complete their own quests in order to survive.<br/><br/>And that was not possible within an existing society or system. Rather, it was beneficial to think out of the box boldly like Youngdungpo Prosecutor’s guild.<br/><br/>“Did you tell me I could be a hero? I would rather be a mercenary. If you need me, you will have to pay the price.”<br/><br/>Lieutenant Colonel Park, dumbfounded, barely opened his mouth, “Are you asking for money now?” </div><h2 id="chapter60">Chapter 60</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “Well, I mean gold.”<br/><br/>Park’s face contorted grotesquely.<br/><br/>“Are you going to do business with the country? If you are armed without responding to the conscription, you might be arrested for treason…”<br/><br/>“Country? Where is it now? Sir, this is no longer the South Korea that I used to know. It’s not a country that can’t help at all when people have been killed for the past several days.<br/><br/>From the moment this happened, there was no country for us.”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo cut him off, Park’s face was flush with anger. But he seemed unable to come up with any proper response.<br/><br/>“Oh my… Every word you are spitting out sounds rebellious. How can you deny the country that has fed and raised you?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo could understand his logic. That’s why the closed group of soldiers called the military was not responding to the new situation properly. They could only think within a certain frame. In this situation, it was impossible to discuss the state system and the response of the people, and flexible thinking was impossible because of military discipline and hierarchy.<br/><br/>“Then, our negotiation has broken down. Let me leave now,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>He got up from the sofa and approached the door.<br/><br/>“Hey!”<br/><br/>Park shouted with a roaring voice from behind.<br/><br/>“You will regret your action! How dare you insult us like this? Do you think you can survive alone when you are hostile to the army? You can expect human power when you join hands with a coalition.”<br/><br/>“…Well, I’m more comfortable when I do it alone.”<br/><br/>Then Sungwoo went out into the hallway.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo!” Sergeant Kim followed him.<br/><br/>Of course there was no chance he came out on his own. Maybe Park and the captain ordered him to persuade Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Sorry to make you feel uncomfortable…”<br/><br/>“No, you don’t have to. Soldiers are not responsible in the military. Did he order you to persuade me?”<br/><br/>“Well…,” Kim made an awkward expression.<br/><br/>“It seems they badly need me.”<br/><br/>“Hahaha…” Kim laughed bitterly and uttered foul words at them.<br/><br/>There was an unknown agony on his face. Then he grabbed Sungwoo’s arm and said firmly, “Yes, we really need your help. But I didn’t know battalion commander Park was such a square. I don’t like the way the officers are handling the situation now. So, I have something to show you. This is a bit of a secret…”<br/><br/>Kim took him to the underground parking lot, then stopped at the entrance to the emergency exit.<br/><br/>“Wait here. I think I should go and take it out secretly. If I’m caught, they’re going to shoot me.”<br/><br/>Saying that, he went into the parking lot where armed soldiers were on alert. Kim took out something from his duffle bag and approached Sungwoo quickly.<br/><br/>“Let’s move toward the stairs because they might notice us.”<br/><br/>Standing at the emergency exit, Kim opened the hard box and took out the green stone.<br/><br/>With unknown symbols engraved on the surface, it seemed to emit a faint glow.<br/><br/>“What’s this?”<br/><br/>“Um, it’s called a ‘Prophecy Stone’.”<br/><br/>“Prophecy?”<br/><br/>“That’s right. I think it’s scattered all over the world, so it seems to predict what will happen in the future. Those of us who are lucky enough to have found this are at an advantage. I don’t think there is anything like balance in this game.”<br/><br/>What Kim said was that nobody would know what would happen.<br/><br/>Sungwoo grabbed the green stone that Sergeant Kim showed.<br/><br/>-You have contacted ‘Prophecy Stone’ (Season 2)’.<br/><br/>Then his vision became dark and a world like a scene from a film projector unfolded.<br/><br/>Swoosh!<br/><br/>It was Gwanghwamun Square. The square overlooking the skyscrapers was stained with gray and blood, and human bodies and monsters were piled up as high as a mountain at the edge. Then there was a huge shadow over it. It was a Wyvern. No, it should be called an Undead Wyvern, to be more precise. The eyes of the monster, whose flesh was torn apart here and there, were dyed green. Then, a very tall skeleton was wearing a crown made of bones with green gems on Wyvern’s back. With its purple robes hanging down to the bottom of its feet, it was holding a huge scythe in its right hand.<br/><br/>‘…Lich?’<br/><br/>It raised its right hand. Then, the eyes of the bodies piled up on Gwanghwamun Street began to turn green. Sungwoo immediately knew what it was.<br/><br/>‘No way. Is it going to take all the …?’<br/><br/>Tens of thousands of bodies trembled and raised their heads the next moment. One by one, they started to get up. Then, just like the trailer of a movie, there appeared people who were killed by the undead’s raid. The corpses swarmed like waves, besieged people were being eaten by the monsters from all sides, and the monsters were climbing up buildings, overturning cars, and breaking open the windows.<br/><br/>-Season 2  To be updated on January 1, 2021.<br/><br/>Sungwoo raised his head. Sergeant Kim gulped, “…What do you think? When I saw the skulls and monsters, etc, I could not help but think of you.”<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo could not answer because a very important message appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/>[Exclusive Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: Who is the master of death?<br/><br/>-Type: Target Acquisition<br/><br/>-Goal: Take away the ‘Death Master’s Sickle’ first.<br/><br/>-Reward: 1st stimulant, exclusive skill<br/><br/>You witnessed a massive slaughter that is to come. And it is an overwhelming power that you cannot dare to hold. If you do not build up the corresponding power, you will be assimilated into the power of “Lich” and become his servant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The location of the ‘Death Master’s Sickle’ will be revealed when you reach Level 15.<br/><br/>Your choice affects your ‘fate.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“···Thank you,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“I have a goal now. Damn it. Level 15?”<br/><br/>The Necromancer’s five stars must have meant the difficulty of the quest.<br/><br/>‘I have about two months left until the start of Season 2 as mentioned here. If I don’t get the Death Master’s Sickle, I’m going to be the Lich’s skull.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not avoid it. If so, what was the fastest way to get it?<br/><br/>“Sergeant Kim, let me ask you one more thing. I know that the boss monsters have been created in each region. Do you know where the Lich is?”<br/><br/>To begin with, the first mainstream boss monsters were created in each region. As far as he remembered, catching a boss monster would grant tremendous rewards that he couldn’t get at the store.<br/><br/>‘It is clear that catching the boss monster is the fastest way to level up.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo decided on the next goal and asked Kim, who seemed to be savvy at collecting information, about the location of the boss monster.<br/><br/>Kim reluctantly nodded and said, “Oh, yes. We did some local spying and witnessed the boss monster. It’s stuck in one important place. My battalion commander considers it the most troublesome.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo climbed the stairs, nodding at him. Kim followed him.<br/><br/>“Good. You said what your military officers wanted was to restore the local area, right?”<br/><br/>In order to occupy the local region, it was absolutely necessary for the army to kill the boss monster in the region.<br/><br/>“Yes. I think they want to lay the groundwork by removing all the threats in this area. But it’s easier said than done. They’re pretending to be good at planning tactics, but without an able player like you, Sungwoo….”<br/><br/>“And battalion commander Park sent you to persuade me, right?”<br/><br/>Although Lieutenant Colonel Park pretended to be hang-tough to Sungwoo, he needed Sungwoo’s help desperately, given that he took the pains to come down here.<br/><br/>“Well, you’re right…”<br/><br/>“Then go and tell him that you have persuaded me to hunt the boss monster. Also, tell him that I have not given up the payment for the job.”<br/><br/>Although Kim was a soldier, he acted as if he was helping Sungwoo. It didn’t matter to Sungwoo if Kim wanted to trick him. All Sungwoo wanted was for Kim to convey his message to Park.<br/><br/>“Well, can you tell me how much you mentioned when I see Park?”<br/><br/>“100,000 gold, and he should pay in advance.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was planning to start the boss raid for a bigger goal.<br/><br/>And he needed to obtain the necessary item set before embarking on the raid. </div><h2 id="chapter61">Chapter 61</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Lieutenant Colonel Park was still sitting on the sofa even after Sunwoo left. Since he couldn’t swallow his pride, he got upset with Sungwoo, and he felt frustrated because his important talks with Sungwoo broke down.<br/><br/>“Battalion commander, honestly, there is no strongman like him here. I saw him fighting vampires. He is a super fighter,” said the captain as if he was very impressed with Sungwoo’s brilliant fighting. The captain was in charge of monitoring the survivors gathered in the Safe Zone after infiltrating a building near Hwaseong Haenggung with Sgt. Kim.<br/><br/>Right there, he witnessed something he could not believe. Commanding dozens of undead, Sungwoo killed the supernatural monsters.<br/><br/>“Sgt. First Class Kang, can’t you deal with them?”<br/><br/>Sgt. First Class Jin-wook Kang was a Level 9 player, the highest level in his unit.<br/><br/>Until now, he had been at the forefront of the monster crackdown team, killing numerous monsters.<br/><br/>“Well, it’s different this time. If Kang is a single strong soldier, Sungwoo is like an army.”<br/><br/>“Army? Isn’t it the same with us? I think that if our soldiers led by Kang join hands, they can beat that guy controlling the skulls. That’s the power of our army, isn’t it?”<br/><br/>But the captain shook his head despite his boss’s firm reassurances.<br/><br/>“Battalion commander, how many soldiers do you think have the guts to sacrifice their lives in a critical moment? For example, a soldier who can jump at the enemy with a bomb.”<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“Whether or not we have a soldier who can sacrifice his life to create a golden opportunity for attack is crucial in this battle. In that respect, Sungwoo’s army members are totally different. They are not just courageous. They don’t have any fear at all. At any time, they can sacrifice themselves then get resurrected. Sungwoo has 30 of them. I think they are stronger than a battalion of troops.”<br/><br/>Lieutenant Colonel Park had always trusted his smart captain.<br/><br/>Sgt. Kim, who was listening next to him, added, “Battalion commander, let me tell you something. I told you I survived after getting a potion from him in return for giving him some intelligence. As far as our deal is concerned, he is a man of his word. We can trust him.”<br/><br/>But the colonel was bothered a bit.<br/><br/>“100,000 gold.”<br/><br/>After all, he didn’t have enough funds.<br/><br/>“We can secure the money. Didn’t you tell us to report about the gold we earned while maintaining the monster crackdown squad near the unit? On average, we earned about 60,000 gold per day.”<br/><br/>It was easier said than done.<br/><br/>If they accepted Sungwoo’s conditions, it would mean they would have to donate the gold the battalion’s troops earned for two days. Of course, Lieutenant Colonel Park was also well aware that gold was greatly helpful.<br/><br/>‘However, our priority should be restoring important bases. As long as the monster is in control of the runway of the 10th Fighter Wing, we cannot escape from this place.’<br/><br/>They could get rid of the boss monster with enough time, but there was a reason they were so impatient now. As it turned out, the boss monster was holding up in the 10th Fighter Wing located in Seryu-dong, Suwon.<br/><br/>The battalion commander sent 20 player soldiers, but they were wiped out in 10 minutes. Since then, they gave up attacking the boss monster.<br/><br/>Transportation was the most important thing in military operations, but transporting on the ground was too dangerous. The ground was blocked by abandoned cars, so it was not easy to clear the road by mobilizing combat vehicles. It was so obvious that they would be exposed to the monsters’ ambush while they were clearing the roads.<br/><br/>As things stood now, the most perfect transportation was the ‘sky,’ on condition they didn’t encounter a group of wyverns.<br/><br/>“Damn it! Let him take back the 10th Fighter Wing. Captain, give the money to his group!” shouted Lieutenant Colonel Park.<br/><br/>100,000 gold was too much for his group, but he had to swallow his pride.<br/><br/>“Give it to that guy. He is crazy about money. I’m going to take the money back by cutting open his belly some day,” said Lieutenant Colonel Park, gnashing his teeth.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Sungwoo received 100,000 gold from the captain who introduced himself as Captain Sung-min Lee. With this, he had a whopping 398,880 gold in his hand.<br/><br/>“Whew! We collected all the gold that our soldiers possessed to secure the 100,000 gold you requested. We hope you can retake the 10th Fighter Wing as soon as possible.”<br/><br/>“You are not supposed to leave your area for the next 5 days anyway. So, can I take care of your request during that period?”<br/><br/>There was a condition. While the first mainstream was going on for seven days, they could not escape to regions other than Hwaseong and Suwon City. Now, there were five days left before the restriction was removed.<br/><br/>“Well, we may need to do maintenance. Besides, the aircraft stored in the hangar may be damaged by the monsters, so I hope you will attack them as soon as possible. Even if you save the pilots, if the fighter crafts are unusable, we can’t do anything, so take it back within 3 days.”<br/><br/>“Let me try.”<br/><br/>“Yes, please. When you begin to crack down on the monsters, we’re going to dispatch some soldiers to help you. Come on, Sgt. First Class Kang.”<br/><br/>When the captain mentioned his name, a bronze-skinned soldier approached.<br/><br/>He seemed to have served in a special force, given the various patches, such as the HALO patch signifying the completion of high altitude descent training, attached to his military uniform.<br/><br/>“My name is Jin-wook Kang, Sgt. First Class. Unfortunately, it looks like I’m going to join you as your deputy in this operation.”<br/><br/>He held out his thick hand to Sungwoo, who grabbed it silently. Sgt. Kang was frowning a lot, but he was not foolish enough to tighten his hand around Sungwoo’s.<br/><br/>“How about your level? If you are lower than me, I feel like I am going to be uncomfortable.”<br/><br/>“I’m Level 10.”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo said that, Sgt. Kang looked surprised.<br/><br/>“Damn it, how did your level go up? I couldn’t even though I killed orcs all day long.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s answer was simple.<br/><br/>“Well, it’s simple. Just kill a monster stronger than an orc.”<br/><br/>“Hah hah hah, if I may give you some advice, you should not be too conceited this time. The crazy monsters residing on the runway of the 10th Fighter Wing are different.”<br/><br/>According to Sgt. Kim’s tipoff a moment ago, they had dispatched about 20 soldiers to take down the monsters and retake the runway of the 10th Fighter Wing, but they were annihilated in 10 minutes. Sgt. First Class Kang was the only one who survived from the group.<br/><br/>“Thank you for the advice. Then, please level up for the next three days.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo did not want to banter with these soldiers anymore, so he turned away.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The survivors of the plaza, who almost became prey of the vampires, stayed around Sungwoo since then. This was what Sungwoo expected.<br/><br/>However, he didn’t even think that whenever he showed up on the first floor, he would be showered with all sorts of applause and shouting from them.<br/><br/>“Oh! Sungwoo is here!”<br/><br/>“Thank you, as always, Sungwoo!”<br/><br/>“Please protect us! Please!”<br/><br/>As if they found out that they had to stay around him to survive, they showered him with all kinds of flattery and crude gifts. A young woman even offered to sleep with him.<br/><br/>They keenly realized that they couldn’t save their lives by themselves.<br/><br/>They felt so insecure at the moment.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I just don’t know how to handle such a big crowd,” said Hanho.<br/><br/>After the soldiers appeared from a nearby base, they seemed to show interest in their military strength, but they just relied more on Sungwoo for their safety.<br/><br/>‘Obviously, I have use for them,’ Sungwoo thought to himself.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, he thought they were not simple refugees, and they were not incapacitated.<br/><br/>‘All of them are players who survived this situation in one way or another. Each of them has a variety of abilities depending on their occupations.”<br/><br/>Of course, Hanho’s parents proved useless in battle. However, they proved they were still useful in other ways by displaying their respective skills. Sungwoo thought the survivors were like Hanho’s parents.<br/><br/>“Hanho, when you see your father, tell him he should set a Safety Zone in the inner exhibition hall over there.”<br/><br/>That’s why Sungwoo planned to take the group of survivors staying at the abandoned factory here. Several hours ago, Kyongsu and Taesung already set out to carry out the mission of escorting them here.<br/><br/>A little later, two buses carrying a group of survivors and all kinds of supplies arrived.<br/><br/>“Oh, this place is definitely more spacious and secure. The facilities are also clean. Good! Hanho, did you say I could make a Safety Zone over there?” asked Hanho’s father.<br/><br/>The municipal art museum was quite large enough with 3,000-pyong (106,761 sq ft), so even if a Safety Zone was created, only a small number of the survivors could be housed.<br/><br/>However, the Safe Zone was good enough as a shelter for them.<br/><br/>“But Dad, you don’t need to install it now. I just want you to know that if something happens, you have to set up a Safety Zone right there.”<br/><br/>It would cost money to maintain the Safety Zone, and the monsters didn’t pose a threat to them all the time. Besides, a well-built concrete wall existed, so there was no need to keep the Safety Zone open at all times.<br/><br/>“Got it. Let me keep it in mind.”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sungwoo called Kyungsoo to the conference room on the second floor.<br/><br/>“Kyungsoo, thanks for driving here on a dangerous road, but I would like to ask you another favor.”<br/><br/>“No problem.”<br/><br/>Except for Hanho, Kyongsu was the man that Sungwoo could trust the most. They had already shared their fate several times.<br/><br/>“I hope you can make this location a nice place where the survivors can live, so we can make use of them in the right place at the right time based on their selected jobs.”<br/><br/>“I think I know what you mean. There are not only combat-related jobs, but also those related to their daily lives or production. We have to use them.”<br/><br/>“Yeah. That’s my point. Nobody here is useless as long as they have jobs and skills. And…” </div><h2 id="chapter62">Chapter 62</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Sungwoo lifted his index finger and pointed to the “Suwon Culture and Tourism Map” on the wall of the conference room.<br/><br/>“Please organize a hunting team with the healthy people among the people, who have combat-related jobs. After that, try to target the low-level monsters nearby.”<br/><br/>“In other words, you want me to secure safety near this place by attacking them?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo shook his head at his question, “The purpose of your attack is to secure gold and the troops. I would like you to create a security guard here even when I am not here. Can I leave this work to you, Kyungsoo?”<br/><br/>With his eyes gleaming, Kyungsoo said with a nod, “Sure! Let me do my best.”<br/><br/>At first, Kyongsu couldn’t do anything while trapped at the shuttle bus stop, but now he was different. He could confront the monsters.<br/><br/>When he heard Sungwoo’s plan, Hanho asked, “Ah, you’re creating a village within the game?”<br/><br/>“Village…”<br/><br/>Commonly called a ‘village’, it was a term for a Safety Zone in the game that wasn’t a field. It would certainly be nice to have at least one such place.<br/><br/>“If we have such a place, it will be useful someday. Now, let’s go hunting again.”<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>All the skeletons except Orun and Werebear skeletons were exploded to catch the Vampire Lord.<br/><br/>Because of this, Sungwoo and his party spent a whole day hunting monster beasts, and finally succeeded in obtaining 4 Werewolf skeletons. He thought he could mobilize them to confront the field monsters.<br/><br/>When night fell, Sungwoo focused on another task. He tried making all the weapons with bones, then handed out one to each skeleton while recording all the synergies.<br/><br/>‘Synergy is the most important variable in battle. I have to collect information, so I can apply the necessary synergy, depending on the situation.’<br/><br/>Sungwoon assigned different kinds of synergies based on the weapons. For example, a dagger had the synergy of a critical hit rate. A blunt weapon had the synergy of a fainting rate, and a spear had the synergy of a penetrating rate. Therefore, they could change their weapons, depending on their opponents.<br/><br/>‘I think I have to use weapons for various purposes next time.’<br/><br/>The next morning Sungwoo and his group were facing the playground of a high school.<br/><br/>“It’s often referred to as drive hunt. It is an RPG game hunting method in which you drive a large number of miscellaneous mobs and catch them at once. You’ll get huge rewards in terms of your hunting time.”<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, can we do this drive hunt?” asked Hanho.<br/><br/>“Yes. I’ve done everything in the Kobold Dungeon.”<br/><br/>The orcs’ village was under construction there, and at first glance, the orcs exceeded 100.<br/><br/>“Now, I am not scared about them anymore.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo injected mana into the four orc bodies in front of the school gate. At that moment, only their bones were separated from their bodies and started to stick to Hanho’s and Jisu’s bodies.<br/><br/>They were part of the newly acquired skill, “Bone Armor Production.”<br/><br/>“It’s lighter than I thought.”<br/><br/>“It will be harder than you think.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo previously tested the durability of this armor. He put it on a Werewolf skeleton and struck it with a knife, but it was much harder than normal bone.<br/><br/>It would be able to withstand the impact even if an orc hit it with an ax a couple of times.<br/><br/>“Since the skeletons can fight against them in the center, we can target those who escape on the sides.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo, Hanho and Jisu walked into the orc’s zone.<br/><br/>While hammering hard, the orcs began to turn their heads one by one. The orcs watched them approaching them without any fear, as if they could not believe their eyes.<br/><br/>Soon the orcs lifted their axes and began to stride toward them as if to tear them apart.<br/><br/>“Kuaaaaah!”<br/><br/>When the red-haired orc screamed, a huge number of warriors began pouring out of the playground.<br/><br/>Guuuuuguuuu!<br/><br/>The ground shook hard when they charged toward the three like a herd of water buffalo moving across the African grasslands. And a huge cloud of sand arose around them.<br/><br/>Poooooooh!<br/><br/>However, the orcs’ threatening posture was overshadowed by the appearance of black smoke. The black smoke from somewhere blocked their vision right before colliding with the three human fighters.<br/><br/>The orcs breathed in the strange smoke, feeling their bodies being crushed little by little from within. Needless to say, they did so because of the influence of the curse. The moment their concentration was disturbed, white arms popped out of the black smoke.<br/><br/>Sharp nails grabbed one of the orc’s neck and twisted it as if turning a doorknob. The orc’s thick neck broke, and his body drooped.<br/><br/>Then, a Werebear skeleton popped out of the smoke. He literally squeezed into the middle of the orcs’ group like a bear and swung his huge paws.<br/><br/>Right behind him, Orun swung the knife in all directions after putting his legs through the bones.<br/><br/>When the Werebear skeleton struck them, the orcs fell helplessly one by one.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>The orcs began to surround the Werebear skeleton and attack him with the axes.<br/><br/>However, the Werebear skeleton looked like an armored tank because of its large build covered with strong bone armor.<br/><br/>The armor on the sides of the Werebear skeleton fell off when its durability ran out.<br/><br/>Noticing it, Sungwoo once again used the ‘Bone Armor Production’ skill.<br/><br/>Bones sprang from the orc corpses scattered on the ground and began to attach to the Werebear skeleton’s body.<br/><br/>Chin! Chin! Chin!<br/><br/>The Werebear skeleton was a great monster of great skill, able to confront one hundred enemies at once. That wasn’t an exaggeration. In a moment, it speared over twenty orc heads.<br/><br/>However, it was outnumbered by the orcs. They avoided beast skeletons like Werebear that they could not rival, then dispersed to the left and right to attack the three in the rear, but Sungwoo and his two friends were far from their easy targets.<br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/>Sungwoo fired the newly acquired item, the Dwarf Lifting Crossbow, in succession.<br/><br/>His attack didn’t cause any big damage. He could fire about 40 arrows per minute, so those orcs charging from the left side collapsed.<br/><br/>On his right were Hanho and Jisu.<br/><br/>“Shoot at the middle of the forehead whenever you see an orc!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/>Sungwoo threw a dagger at the orc charging toward him, which rotated in a parabolic line and hit the orc’s forehead dozens of meters away.<br/><br/>“Look! I told you, man!”<br/><br/>Then, a light protective shield appeared around Hanho’s body. He obtained a sacred shield for 10 seconds when he killed his opponent.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>At that moment, an ax thrown by an orc bounced away from Hanho’s body.<br/><br/>Jisu confronted three orcs at the same time. This time she didn’t attack them recklessly because she was outnumbered.<br/><br/>She crisscrossed among them, guided by her ‘exquisite sense’ skill.<br/><br/>Whenever she swung her sword, the orcs’ stomachs were torn and their tendons were broken. Large orcs piled up one by one when she fought her way through them.<br/><br/>That wasn’t the end.<br/><br/>Zombies were approaching behind the Orcs this time. Besides, even those zombies were firmly armed with bone armor.<br/><br/>The orcs began to fall helplessly, surrounded by the enemies who were far fewer than themselves.<br/><br/>The corpses of their fellows began to accumulate under the orcs’ feet.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>With the corpses swelling, there began corpse explosions with the AoE damage. Numerous orcs, caught in the explosion, bounced in all directions without even swinging their axes.<br/><br/>-You earned 160 gold by hunting Orcs.<br/><br/>-You earned 160 gold by hunting Orcs.<br/><br/>-You earned 160 gold by hunting Orcs.<br/><br/>Even after the explosions ended, these kinds of messages kept coming.<br/><br/>It was a huge drive hunt that devoured a total of 112 at the Orc Village instantly.<br/><br/>“Wow! We hit the jackpot!”<br/><br/>“Of course, Sungwoo killed most of the orcs. But I think I scored a lot, compared with my first time hunting,” Jisu said.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, look over there. It looks like the school has a store? Uh? No?”<br/><br/>There was a gold icon floating on the first floor of the school building where Hanho pointed, but it was an icon that they had never seen before.<br/><br/>“If it’s a hammer shape, is it a blacksmith?”<br/><br/>“Let’s go there first.”<br/><br/>They headed there. They opened the glass door of the school, then opened the doors of the three classrooms on the first floor.<br/><br/>“What is that?”<br/><br/>There was a gold table in the center. It was made of metal and old-fashioned. At first glance it was a workbench that one could see in a workshop.<br/><br/>Sungwoo approached it. Then, a complex message appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/>[Item production/combination]<br/><br/>-There are items that you can produce.<br/><br/>Sea Spirit’s Tears (Material) + Devil’s Bloodstone (Material) + Elder Slime’s Core (Medium) = ???<br/> * Required money: 100,000 gold<br/><br/>‘Can legendary grade items be combined with each other?’<br/><br/>Then, how great of an item will be made? </div><h2 id="chapter63">Chapter 63</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            The place where the golden hammer-shaped icon was floating. It was a blacksmith.<br/><br/>There wasn’t a blacksmith NPC. Like an unmanned kiosk, there was only one combination table there.<br/><br/>-There are items that you can combine:<br/><br/>Sea Spirit’s Tears (Material) + Devil’s Bloodstone (Material) + Elder Slime’s Core (Medium) = ???<br/> * Required cost: 100,000 gold<br/><br/>It seemed a notification came up when there was anything that could be combined, but it seemed that the main ingredients were the ‘Sea Spirit’s Tears’ Sungwoo obtained from the store and the ‘Devil’s Bloodstone’ he obtained after defeating the Orc Chief.<br/><br/>‘Oh, I have an Elder Slime’s Core.’<br/><br/>The ‘Elder Slime Core’ he obtained from the Hidden Dungeon was used as an important medium to combine the two items. Sungwoo took out all three items from his bag.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Elder Slime’s Core<br/><br/>-Grade: Rare<br/><br/>-Category: combination material<br/><br/>-Description: This is Elder Slime’s Core. It is covered with a thick shell, but there is a condensation of strong acid that dissolves anything inside. It looks like it can be used to melt or combine hard objects.<br/><br/>‘I think it’s important to obtain this combination material.’<br/><br/>He felt that he could not combine the two legendary items without Elder Slime Core.<br/><br/>Sungwoo put the three items on the table one after another.<br/><br/>Then the following message appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/>-It requires the costs (100,000). You’ll probably incur damage (2%). Do you want to proceed?<br/><br/>“Proceed!”<br/><br/>Of course Sungwoo could pay 100,000 gold and incur 2 percent of damage.<br/><br/>-Combination of your items is in progress right now. Please step back from the table for your safety.<br/><br/>Yongho’s party took one step back. Then the table vibrated and glowed, and the three items on the table began to shake. As if they became like a plasma, they were crushed and spread in all directions, then began to gather at the center of the table.<br/><br/>Wuuuuuung!<br/><br/>Soon, the three items were put together in one form.<br/><br/>-The combination has been completed.<br/><br/>What was created through the combination was not like the blue Sea Spirit’s Tears, nor the black Demon’s Bloodstone. It was a round object that emitted purple light.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this? It was successful, right? You didn’t see any message like ‘Hey, it slipped from your hand!’ Right?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo approached the table and slowly picked up the item.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Chaos Crystal<br/><br/>-Grade: Legendary<br/><br/>-Category: Orb<br/><br/>-Effect: It gives its owner the attribute of ‘chaos’. Increases mana (+500). Recovers mana (+250%). Takes away the opponent’s mana and life at the same time when you attack (3%).<br/><br/>An item with the attribute of ‘chaos’ was created when the two items with completely different attributes were combined.<br/><br/>‘Chaos? How’s it different from the devil? Obviously, this is a very special concept that I can’t get easily.’<br/><br/>On the one hand, its grade was still legendary, but one step above the previous legendary gradd.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it would ‘absorb’ the opponent’s mana and stamina from the beginning unlike in the past when it consumed the opponent’s stamina only after absorbing his mana.<br/><br/>In other words, it could even “absorb blood” as it was commonly referred to.<br/><br/>“I also see a combination option before my eyes,” said Jisu.<br/><br/>Next was Jisu’s turn. She put an ‘Ignition Whetstone’ and a long blade she used often on the table.<br/><br/>Wooooong!<br/><br/>Then there occurred the same phenomena as before, then a sword appeared in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>Jisu picked up the sword and swung it lightly. Then she quietly made a satisfied smile, “It says it can activate or deactivate the enhanced ignition function and burn those around the affected area.”<br/><br/>As it turned out, the ignition function, which was quite useful so far, was embedded into the sword itself. In addition, it appeared to have some additional options.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Hanho, unfortunately, did not have any items eligible for combination.<br/><br/>“Only I don’t have one…”<br/><br/>“Don’t be heartbroken, you know how to throw daggers well.”<br/><br/>“Pardon? What does it matter?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know. I can’t find any other words to comfort you now.”<br/><br/>After marking the location of the blacksmith, they moved to the store in the used car sales complex.<br/><br/>Before they went to catch the boss monster on the runway, they planned to arm themselves as much as possible. Sungwoo still had more than 300,000 gold. Jisu and Hanho also had a lot of gold.<br/><br/>However, when they arrived at the used car sales complex, they could not spend a single penny.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this? We can’t use this at all.”<br/><br/>The computer that served as the function of a shop was terribly smashed.<br/><br/>“They just put this here to block the monsters from coming in, but it was useless.”<br/><br/>They parked a car at the entrance of the building and blocked the broken door with furniture, but it seemed they could not stop the monsters.<br/><br/>Sungwoo picked up the half-broken keyboard of the computer.<br/><br/>“I think someone did it on purpose.”<br/><br/>There was some evidence that showed somebody’s malice inside the destroyed store.<br/><br/>For example, someone took out only the computer and smashed it, and there was some writing on one wall that looked like someone scraped with a knife.<br/><br/>Jisu swept the wall with his hand and read the writing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who the hell destroyed this store and why? Isn’t a store necessary for everyone? I don’t understand how a monster could write such a perfect sentence.”<br/><br/>Like Hanho said, the smartest monster they encountered was Kobold. However, given Kobold’s poor skills in speaking or writing, it was not Kobold who was responsible for the writing.<br/><br/>“It looks like a claw,” Sungwoo said, looking closely at the scratched letters on the wall.<br/><br/>He did not have enough forensic knowledge to judge the weapon by looking at the damage. However, he noticed the shallow scratches visible around the deeply cut letters.<br/><br/>Jisu said with a nod, “Surely, it looks like the scratches were made while the monster was engraving the letters with a multi-edged object.”<br/><br/>Of course, it was impossible to figure out how large the claw was, or what kind of animal it was.<br/><br/>“I hate to think about anything like a speaking animal unless it was designed by Disney.”<br/><br/>They had to go back empty-handed and wondering about the identity of the attackers.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>It started to get dark.<br/><br/>Yongho and his group’s next destination was the city art museum where the survivors were gathered, often called the ‘Village.’ Since Hanho kept calling it a village, they also began to call it that.<br/><br/>While moving along the road, they encountered a group of soldiers.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo?” asked Sgt. Kim.<br/><br/>He was the leader of the monster crackdown team of his military unit.<br/><br/>“Sgt. Kim, what brought you here?”<br/><br/>“Ah, we have been steadily looking for the monsters around here. Since we were given a ‘group quest,’ this is our assignment. I didn’t know I would miss the days when I was standing at the guard post…”<br/><br/>“A group quest?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo never heard the term before because he was given only a few exclusive quests.<br/><br/>“Yes. Just like a daily quest, all of our unit members are given a quest to hunt more than a few monsters a day. When they carry out their mission, our battalion commander will give them a comprehensive reward, but I don’t know what it is.”<br/><br/>“Then, you don’t get anything as a soldier?”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kim laughed and shrugged.<br/><br/>“Well, if you complete the quest, you will increase your attack and defense power by 10 percent the next day, so it’s good for your chance of survival, but it certainly feels different.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought the soldiers had a mission when they were cracking down on the monsters, but that was not true.<br/><br/>“By the way, even if I keep catching Goblins and Orcs, they just keep crawling out from somewhere. I wonder if they are respawning.”<br/><br/>“Respawn” meant that a dead unit reappeared in a specific location in the game.<br/><br/>Hanho, who was listening next to him, said with a nod, “Wow, that’s possible, I think. You don’t even know where they came from in the first place, right? They might have been created automatically in a place you never know.”<br/><br/>“But I hope not,” lamented Sgt. Kim.<br/><br/>He had several dog tags around his neck. He said his unit was just returning to the village, so they went together.<br/><br/>“Were there any members who deserted the unit after this incident happened? I think all of them might have wanted to look for their families.”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kim sighed at his question and said, “You bet. The guys who became players early on deserted the unit after grabbing a handful of knives.”<br/><br/>“I see.”<br/><br/>“Yes, but they were all taken care of. In fact, it’s dangerous for them to move around randomly, and if they didn’t get any buff while carrying out group quests, they got nervous. Anyway, we could not let them move around, unchecked, because they deserted the army.”<br/><br/>Obviously, the unit commander took some measures to prevent his members from deserting the army, but Sgt. Kim began to complain about it. </div><h2 id="chapter64">Chapter 64</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “Actually, I am also confused. We are definitely soldiers. I’m skeptical whether it is right to move around like this. Over the past few days, more than half of my classmates and junior soldiers have been killed, god damn it!”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kim clenched his teeth, expressing extreme frustration. Sungwoo shook his head at Sgt. Kim’s unexpected reaction.<br/><br/>“Well, I understood their behavior at first, but I thought they would respond well after adapting to this system to some extent. Isn’t it the way you guys behave while serving in the army?”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kim shook his head firmly at Sungwoo’s question.<br/><br/>Then, he began to blow off steam, complaining about Lieutenant Colonel Park.<br/><br/>“For quite some time I’ve been kept in the dark about the situation. Then suddenly I was given an order to crack down on the monsters without any proper weapons. The monsters are completely different from the enemies we soldiers have been trained to confront. They just drove our soldiers into the dungeon.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo just listened silently.<br/><br/>Sgt. Kim continued, “And they collected the gold we earned and stopped us from using the community… Oh, I don’t know why I’m making this kind of complaint to you. Sorry.”<br/><br/>Obviously, the army leaders had tight control of the players within the army, but it was difficult for Sungwoo to judge whether their action was justified or wrong.<br/><br/>“Sgt. Kim, I think what matters now is survival. I mean your own life.”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“The army will never control the current situation, so they are going to control those who have survived. Of course, this is just my intuition, so you can ignore it.”<br/><br/>In fact, Sungwoo knew he could not control this situation with the old-fashioned systems and methodology. His clumsy attempt to use then could have cost more lives like Sgt. Kim’s comrades who were killed over the last few days.<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought that a group like the “Guild” created by the guy with community ID ‘Prosecutor Youngdungpo’ had a greater potential than the army.<br/><br/>Sgt. Kim nodded with a bitter expression, then said, “Still, I value your intuition, Sungwoo, so let me think about it.”<br/><br/>Then, Sgt. Kim gave him additional information about the boss monster in the 10th Fighter Wing. He said the monster was a giant swinging a club, so Sungwoo gathered all the information about the monster, while preparing to attack in the coming days.<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party arrived near the Hwaseong Temporary Palace where the village was located. At that moment they saw a bloody fight going on at the village.<br/><br/>“Ahhh! Stop him!”<br/><br/>“We lost him. Let’s get inside!”<br/><br/>The entrance to the village had already turned into a sea of blood.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo! Watch out!”<br/><br/>“Everybody, get ready for the fight!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s group pulled out their swords, and Sgt. Kim’s squad members dispersed to the left and right. As if they had their own combat formation, those at the front were holding square shields and one-handed swords. The four in the middle were holding spears. The four in the rear row were armed with bows and crossbows, but the opponent was far from an easy target.<br/><br/>“Damn it, they are Werebears! We really can’t fight them. So, whenever we encountered them before we just retreated.”<br/><br/>Three Wearbears were attacking the entrance to the city’s art museum. There were already five or six victims out there, and one of the Werebears was sitting in the center, chewing on the fallen bodies.<br/><br/>It seems they were ambushed by the Werebears only a little while ago because several combat fighters, including Kyongu, were retreating into the building.<br/><br/>“Okay, you stay here.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was different from the others. He didn’t regard the Werebears as tough opponents. He thought this was not a crisis but a great opportunity.<br/><br/>‘If I catch four Wearbears, they will be a tremendous addition to my power in the upcoming raid on the boss monster. These giant monsters…’<br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/>Sungwoo fired a repeating crossbow randomly and activated a Grand Fellblade at the entrance of the museum where the Wearbears were gathered.<br/><br/>Wuuuuuuw!<br/><br/>The Werebears roared in fear, but soon they disappeared into the fatal black smoke of Grand Fellblade. The next moment, the smoke completely disappeared, and the bloody Werebears appeared.<br/><br/>Bone monsters, clad in bone armor, were now trampling and tearing the beasts apart.<br/><br/>“Oh, my God. I can’t believe this!.”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kim watched Sungwoo fighting the beasts. He had seen it before, but this time he was so sorry for his fallen soldiers.<br/><br/>He recalled the faces of his fellow comrades and junior soldiers who had been killed when they were put into the previous battles by incompetent and inefficient leaders.<br/><br/>“Even if I can’t fight like Sungwoo…I shouldn’t have fought like that in the past.”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kim thought that he quickly came to his senses. When the goblins appeared before his eyes, he was the first to wield his sword. When the officers took the player’s weapons, he was the one who had the soldiers take shovels to fight against the monsters.<br/><br/>However, the officers collected the weapons and gold the players had obtained, then ordered them to mount a reckless attack on the excuse of retaking the garrison. Judging that he now came back to normal, Sgt. Kim carried out the order without any complaint while encouraging his men to carry out the order. He had been a squad leader.<br/><br/>“….”<br/><br/>What was the problem? Why were so many guys killed meaninglessly?<br/><br/>‘Was it right that I followed his order that time? What else could I have done?’<br/><br/>Soon, Sungwoo was done fighting, and he got a huge payout. The four Werebears, who were running wildly a moment ago, were resurrected as huge collections of bones and stood up again.<br/><br/>‘Sungwoo Yoo, this guy is different. He is surviving very efficiently.’<br/><br/>Clad in bone armor, the four huge Werebears, three meters tall, stood tall behind Sungwoo.<br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wild Tyrant (Phase 1)<br/><br/>-Category: Ethnic Synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: 4 or more bears and creatures<br/><br/>-Effect: Decreases the opponent’s defense (-10%), increases ally’s defense (+10%)<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at Sgt. Kim, “Sgt. Kim, please tell your boss that we’re ready.”<br/><br/>When he said that, Sgt. Kim realized what was wrong. In short, he was too impatient about the attack instead of thinking hard about proper preparation.<br/><br/>“I think we can start retaking the runway.”<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>According to Kyongsu, while he and his team members were returning after destroying a goblin village nearby, three Werebears charged at them suddenly.<br/><br/>“It’s all my fault. I should have paid a little more attention, but I didn’t know they were jumping from the rooftop…”<br/><br/>Because of the goblins’ sudden ambush, five of Kyongsu’s crackdown task force members were killed.<br/><br/>“I don’t think it’s your fault, Kyongsu. It would have been difficult for anyone to respond to such an attack. You did your job very well.”<br/><br/>“Ah…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo grabbed his shoulder and comforted him. In fact, Kyongsu held up his end.<br/><br/>When the other members of his team fled into the Safety Zone, Kyongsu defended the entrance of the building until everyone evacuated safely.<br/><br/>Right at that moment, fortunately, Sungwoo came.<br/><br/>“You even killed the goblins trying to get into the building at the last minute,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>As it turned out, the last Werebear, who was injured severely, rushed into the main entrance of the museum, where Kyongsu was standing.<br/><br/>However, his spear penetrated the Werebear’s eyes and destroyed his brain. He was lucky, but it was his responsibility to destroy the Werebear.<br/><br/>“I think it was good for me to leave this task to you, Kyongsu. I will leave here as the day breaks. So, keep up with the good work.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo cheered him up, then stood. At that moment, Sgt. First Class Kang was coming down from the stairs on the second floor.<br/><br/>“What happened? I don’t know the situation because I was sleeping.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo questioned whether Kang was really a soldier, given that he didn’t know some of his men were killed a little ago because of the monsters’ attack.<br/><br/>“We were ambushed.”<br/><br/>“Oh, I heard the attackers were Werebears. Well, I killed one in the past. Man, when he touched me, I realized how powerful he was. Have you killed such a monster before?” Sgt. Kang asked Sungwoo.<br/><br/>He laughed, stretching out his rough hand. He was trying to macho it out.<br/><br/>“Well, I can touch them anytime.”<br/><br/>Four Werebear skeletons were standing behind Sungwoo’s back. Then, they suddenly disappeared somewhere. He moved them to the subspace.<br/><br/>“Wow, what a skill! How did you do that? Man, this world is crazy, isn’t it? That’s why I prefer something simple enough to understand.”<br/><br/>According to Sgt. Kim, Sgt. First Class Kang chose a 3-star “striker”. So, his main fighting style was based on punching rather than using weapons.<br/><br/>However, Kang didn’t tell him which card he chose for its synergy effect with the previous card, saying he didn’t want to reveal his main strength.<br/><br/>At that moment, Sgt. Kim, who was standing on one side of the hall on the first floor, approached Kang and said, “Sgt. First Class Kang, Sungwoo has told me that he’s going to depart for the raid on the boss monster soon. I think you had better prepare…”<br/><br/>“Ugh? When did you start working as his mouthpiece?”<br/><br/>“Pardon?” </div><h2 id="chapter65">Chapter 65</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “When the operation begins, Sungwoo, my boss will give me an order directly. Why are you bothering to deliver his message to me like this? By the way, did you crack down on the goblins successfully?”<br/><br/>“Of course.”<br/><br/>However, Sgt. First Class Kang snorted at his reply.<br/><br/>“Well, I don’t think you did. I still remember you have been talking bullshit since our soldiers were killed during our special operation at Kyonggi Province recently. I know you told people around you that they were killed meaninglessly.”<br/><br/>“Well, that was because…”<br/><br/>“Since then, our gold income has also shrunk, but you are pretending to have a hard time. Your company commander may give it a pass, but I won’t. You know that our battalion commander can check out your location in real time, right?”<br/><br/>Sgt. First Class Kang bluntly criticized him without caring about Sungwoo at all, as if he was a thoughtless man from the beginning. However, Sgt. Kim discovered some important tips while talking with Sgt. Kang.<br/><br/>‘Checking my location in real-time? It seems the army is also working in an organized system at the moment. That’s why the soldiers trying to desert the army have been greatly reduced.’<br/><br/>For some reason, Sgt. Kim saw red, as if he could not stand it anymore.<br/><br/>“Sgt. First Class Kang, you are so mean to me! Do you know that Hyongsuk was killed in action during the operation a little while ago?”<br/><br/>Then, Sgt. Kim got enraged at Sgt. Kang and took out one of the dog tags hanging around his neck.<br/><br/>“I couldn’t even bring his body here! How can you be so mean to me when you don’t know anything about the situation?”<br/><br/>As soon as Sgt. Kim balked, Sgt. First Class Kang immediately grabbed him by the collar with his left hand. Sgt. Kim dropped the killed soldier’s military serial number chain on the floor.<br/><br/>“Hey, Sgt. Kim, are you crazy? Are you challenging me now?”<br/><br/>“Urgh!”<br/><br/>“Cut the bullshit and collect more gold for me, okay? When you do it, I can beat the boss monster. Why are you guys making a big fuss like this when you are only killing Goblins or Orcs? Don’t you know I’m killing all the scary big monsters?”<br/><br/>“I’m not pretending to be sick, Sgt. First Class Kang!”<br/><br/>“It’s because you’re incompetent that our soliders were killed by the monsters.”<br/><br/>At that moment someone grabbed Sgt. Kang’s thick forearm.<br/><br/>“Sgt. First Class Kang, let me speak to you directly, not through Sgt. Kim. Prepare to attack the boss monster on the runway as soon as possible.”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang’s eyebrows wriggled at Sungwoo’s sharp voice.<br/><br/>“Well, I need to discipline Sgt. Kim. He is slacking off…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo cut him off and said, “I heard you can not waste time here. Right?”<br/><br/>After all, Sgt. Kang let go of his grip around Sgt. Kim’s neck, but responded in annoyance.<br/><br/>“Sure, no problem. Packing military equipment is a piece of cake, so don’t worry. Why don’t you get ready quickly, boss. Let me smoke a cigarette outside for a moment.”<br/><br/>Having said that, Sgt. Kang went out of the building, and Sgt. Kim flopped down on the floor, gasping for breath. His uniform jacket was tattered when Sgt. Kang released his tight grip on the collar. Squad members ran to him.<br/><br/>“Sgt. Kim, are you okay?”<br/><br/>“Are you not hurt? That son of a bitch… ”<br/><br/>It seemed that Sgt. Kim was at least respected among his junior soldiers.<br/><br/>“Uh, I’m okay. Sorry, Sungwoo. I think I showed you something you didn’t have to see.”<br/><br/>“That’s fine. Are you okay?”<br/><br/>“I’m alright. It looks like Sgt. First Class Kang tried to macho up in front of you. In fact, he is a very competitive man, so I’ve felt that he has been very nervous since you came.”<br/><br/>“I see.”<br/><br/>“Well, I think I have to help you, Sungwoo. Since we are a volunteer force who decided to support you with Sgt. First Class Kang, we will finish the preparations quickly.”<br/><br/>Then, he brushed the dirt from his clothes and walked to the place where he put his weapons. His shoulders drooped.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The 10th Fighter Wing was located in Seryu-dong, next to Seryu Station in Suwon City.<br/><br/>Two military trucks stood blocking the entrance of a convenience store there.<br/><br/>Two military officers were sitting on plastic chairs inside the store.<br/><br/>“I want to report something, Battalion Commander. It’s on the community bulletin. It seems that the guy with the community ID ‘Yongdungpo Prosecutor’ is absorbing even the college student group in Hyehwa-dong and increasing his force. This morning another group declared the formation of a guild in Pusan. It’s called ‘Hwarang’.”<br/><br/>Lieutenant Colonel Park frowned at Captain Lee’s briefing.<br/><br/>“The reds are raising their ugly heads as if on cue. Did you say Hwarang? That’s bullshit! Anyway, sort out the briefing material because I have to meet the regiment commander later.”<br/><br/>“Yes, sir! But I wonder why there are no comments yet on the community bulletin from our soldiers. If you give me an order, I can post a comment.”<br/><br/>Lieutenant Colonel Park shook his head and said, “Company Commander, think carefully about the reason. Our military is reluctant to use the unknown communication, not just your own computer network.”<br/><br/>“Ah!”<br/><br/>Captain Lee uttered exclamations out of habit, but he was still full of curiosity.<br/><br/>Lieutenant Colonel Park continued, “The moment you reveal your affiliation with the military or the government, the enemy can find out your location, right? Isn’t it possible that the enemy can see your position? Information is vital. You can’t use the program when you don’t know who created it. The government and the military are taking a prudent approach because of that.”<br/><br/>Captain Lee could not hide his bitter expression. Now, he was seriously questioning whether it was right for him to trust his boss’s judgment because the community system was so influential that it was hard to rule it out just because its origin was unknown.<br/><br/>But there was nothing he could judge and no action he could take on his own. As a military officer, he had to obey and follow his boss’s orders.<br/><br/>At that moment, Captain Lee sensed Lieutenant Colonel Park’s sharp gaze at him, so he quickly suppressed the dissatisfaction on his face.<br/><br/>“I guess you clearly conveyed our soldiers my message, right? Once you defeat the boss monster, the next target is that guy, Sungwoo. Our regiment commander wants us to eliminate all the uncooperative forces.”<br/><br/>“Got it. Let me convey your message once more. Two squads and Sgt. First Class Kang will be deployed for the raid. They are Sgt. Kim’s Squad 1 and Corporal Choi’s Squad 3. Corporal Choi’s squad will infiltrate in advance and attack the guy at the last minute. I will also be on standby at the site.”<br/><br/>“Good. If possible, don’t kill him right away. I hope you can take back the 100,000 gold he snatched from us or more than that if you can. Of course, don’t overdo it, if possible.”<br/><br/>“Let me take good care of it.”<br/><br/>“Yes, let me trust you this time.”<br/><br/>At that moment, a soldier with a circular shield opened the door of the convenience store.<br/><br/>“Battalion Commander, they have arrived!”<br/><br/>Sunwoo and his party finally arrived.<br/><br/>“So, do they want to come this way?”<br/><br/>“No, they went into the 10th Fighter Wing right away.”<br/><br/>“He really sucks!” Lieutenant Colonel Park shouted.<br/><br/>Captain Lee stood up and said, “Okay, let me carry out your order.”<br/><br/>“Make sure you remove him properly. Otherwise, he will be an obstacle to our cause someday. Like our regiment commander said, we must get rid of him for our future.”<br/><br/>The company commander saluted, but his expression was rather confused. He could not believe Lieutenant Colonel Park’s order that he should get rid of Sungwoo, but he could only carry out his order.<br/><br/>“Sure, no problem. Sgt. First Class Kang will smash his head.”<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>A long runway unfolded before his eyes.<br/><br/>“Hey? How can the fighters take off on a runway like this?”<br/><br/>Sgt. First Class Kang covered his forehead with both hands as if he was frustrated.<br/><br/>The place, which must always be thoroughly managed for the take-off and landing of the fighters, was a mess.<br/><br/>The thick asphalt was cracked and scattered as if somebody scraped it with a plow.<br/><br/>“It looks like the boss monster was playing there and scribbling on the asphalt. I fought him a few days ago, and he was so mighty. Bitch!”<br/><br/>Although he had been assigned to Sungwoo as his deputy, Sgt. First Class Kang didn’t tell Sungwoo in detail about the boss monster. Sgt. Kang was intentionally limiting the information, so much so that it was questionable if he really wanted Sungwoo to defeat the boss monster.<br/><br/>It seemed that the military leadership didn’t mean it, but obviously Sgt. Kang was not telling all the information because of his jealousy of Sungwoo.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo could get enough information from Sgt. Kim.<br/><br/>The boss monster’s name is ‘Giant Troll’.<br/><br/>In fantasy, a creature called a troll is depicted as a giant with tremendous resilience.<br/><br/>The troll here wasn’t much different. Like the modifier, ‘giant,’ he’s five meters tall, and his skin was as hard as an iron plate. And even if his skin was torn off, it would regenerate in an instant, which was the biggest headache for Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Thump, Thump.<br/><br/>The boss monster’s rattling footsteps came from inside the aircraft hangar. Then, a thick arm popped out through a gap and grabbed the door of the hangar.<br/><br/>Bang! </div><h2 id="chapter66">Chapter 66</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            The boss monster ripped open the door of the hangar, revealing its heavy body.<br/><br/>Gruuuuu….<br/><br/>-The local boss monster ‘Giant Troll’ has appeared.<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not think of any other expression to describe him as a giant.<br/><br/>“What a crazy giant…”<br/><br/>The dark green monster dressed in brown leather stood tall, facing Sungwoo and his party.<br/><br/>His skin was covered with thick projections and looked tough at a glance. He wore an accessory made of skeletons and bloody flesh around his thick neck.<br/><br/>He was holding a giant stick in his right hand, which he seemed to have made by pulling up an entire tree.<br/><br/>“Dang it! I can’t believe it. I thought there would be only fighters in such a hanger. Who would have thought a huge beat with two feet would come out from such a place?”<br/><br/>“The monster is completely different from the typical monster we have dealt with until now.”<br/><br/>Hanho and Jisu did not hide their embarrassment, and Sgt. Kim’s squad members were also scared. Even Sungwoo could not help but grow tense.<br/><br/>‘Man, he’s twice as big as the largest skeleton, the Werebear skeleton. Given it’s a boss monster, he is probably incomparable to the previous monsters…’<br/><br/>After obtaining 4 Werebear skeletons, Sungwoo planned to outpower the boss monster, but he felt he had to give it up quickly.<br/><br/>Thump- thump-<br/><br/>The boss monster started to approach them.<br/><br/>“How about it, Sungwoo? Can you figure out his strength? It’s not too late. You can return the Sgt. 100,000 gold even now,” said Kang, chuckling at Sungwoo, but Sungwoo attacked without an answer.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Death Response’ begins in that area.<br/><br/>First, Sungwoo summoned zombies in front of the Giant Troll. Squishy mud appeared on the surface of the asphalt road on the runway, and zombies began to crawl out of it.<br/><br/>Wuuuuuuh!<br/><br/>Ten zombies ran wildly towards the Giant Troll, but they looked like small tolls before the giant standing five meters tall.<br/><br/>The Giant Troll didn’t even swing the stick, as if the zombies were ridiculous, then began to kill them by trampling with his feet as if they were worms.<br/><br/>Thump! Thump!<br/><br/>Sungwoo was actually looking for that very moment.<br/><br/>“Explosion.”<br/><br/>Pop!<br/><br/>A corpse exploded right under the Giant Troll’s feet, but it was different. The explosion, which always showed tremendous effects before, made him only stumble a bit.<br/><br/>‘This monster is not just big. His defense power is enormous. Moreover, it has good resilience, so the sustained damage caused by my curse is not going to work.’<br/><br/>In some respects, Sungwoo was lucky so far. Whenever he encountered Slimes, vampires, wizards, and other enemies, he could easily defeat them with his skills, but he couldn’t always be lucky.<br/><br/>‘He’s like my natural enemy.’<br/><br/>In fact, it was clear that the boss monster was so mighty that even Sungwoo’s main skills could not function properly.<br/><br/>“Oh my… you can’t even use your lethal skills?” Sgt. Kang asked sarcastically.<br/><br/>With his arms folded, he was now watching Sungwoo casually. It looked like he would even eat popcorn cheerfully, watching Sungwoo struggling.<br/><br/>“Sgt. First Class Kang, you said you served in a special force, so let me ask you something. How would you deal with such a giant monster?”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang scratched his cheek with an air of conceit.<br/><br/>“Heavens! You are asking for my advice! It looks like you have spaced out because of that monster. I’m sorry, but actually I don’t know how to respond because I was transferred out of the special forces because I couldn’t adapt myself there. But what I learned there was just do as you were instructed, such as shooting, exploding and beating. That’s it.”<br/><br/>“Well, it looks like a movie screenwriter is one cut above a special forces man like you.”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“Have you ever watched a movie called Star Wars or District 13?”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang apparently looked embarrassed, unable to figure out what Sungwoo was trying to point out.<br/><br/>“Well, I suddenly wondered if I could make such a movie scene come true here. Well, I can find out if I implement my plan now.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned one of the skeletons then began to take something out of his bag.<br/><br/>It was a bunch of colorful ropes. It was a very tough mountain rope called ‘climbing rope.’<br/><br/>“Yeah, that’s why you have to keep everything at hand. It was good for me to stop by the mountaineering supply store next to the bicycle supply store. Hanho, Jisu, please help me.”<br/><br/>“Oh, yes.”<br/><br/>“What are you going to do?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo tied the climbing rope to the spine of the Werebear skeleton. Then, he tied the other end to the spine of the other Werebear skeleton. They were now connected as a pair.<br/><br/>Thump- Thump-<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Giant Troll was approaching Sungwoo. With a smile on his face, the Giant Troll approached at a very relaxed pace.<br/><br/>While watching the giant monster and Sungwoo working on an unknown task alternately, Sgt. Kang gradually hardened his expression.<br/><br/>“Hey, that monster is getting closer to you now. What are you doing, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/>“According to the manual, this has great ‘tensile strength’, so much so that it can withstand 2 tons of force. Of course that monster might be stronger than that, so let me stack several like this…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo tied several climbing ropes to the back of the four Werebear skeletons.<br/><br/>At a glance, it seemed he wrapped them with more than 10 strands of ropes.<br/><br/>“I don’t know if it’s enough, but let’s go.”<br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo ordered, they began the unknown operation.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>The four Wearbears with the ropes on their back rushed forward. Whenever they moved, the ropes fluttered like a wave, and the bundle of rope rolled up on the floor began to disappear quickly.<br/><br/>Wuuuuuuh!<br/><br/>The Giant Troll also cried out, sensing the impending fight. Since his shouting was so loud, even his skull was seen rattling even from a distance.<br/><br/>“Ugh! That damned voice is really terrifying!”<br/><br/>At that moment, the four Werebear skeletons were split on both sides. Just before they came close to the Giant Troll, two of them ran to the left and the other two to the right.<br/><br/>The Giant Troll also stopped suddenly when they dispersed before his eyes.<br/><br/>But the dull-headed boss monster could not figure out why.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>The four Werebear skeletons began to circle around the Giant Troll.<br/><br/>Whenever they circled the giant, the climbing ropes slowly began to bind his legs.<br/><br/>At first, the monster didn’t bother much, but the long rope was shortened at a much faster rate than he thought, then coiled around his legs in an instant.<br/><br/>Guhaaaaah!<br/><br/>The power squeezing his legs was tremendous. Eventually, the tough climbing rope completely encircled him from his ankles to the pelvis, which made it impossible for him to move at all. He staggered for a moment, then fell to the side with a thump.<br/><br/>“Rush and attack him!”<br/><br/>At that very moment, all the skeletons moved at Sungwoo’s order. They were charging at the huge chunk of unprotected meat at a tremendous speed.<br/><br/>“Huh, huh huh…”<br/><br/>Watching the incredible spectacle unfolding before his eyes, Sgt. Kang was still sarcastically chuckling. Although he was quite impressed with Sungwoo’s extraordinary attack skills, he was troubled by other worries.<br/><br/>‘Man, I was going to attack this guy when he was weakened while confronting the Giant Troll. Damn it, I can’t carry out my plan in this situation.’<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo pushed his back, shouting, “Come on, go and get him! You said you were quite good at beating somebody at the special forces. I think you can catch the boss monster more easily than I think.”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang could not think straight. He had to find another chance to kill Sungwoo.<br/><br/>In fact, Sgt. Kang has seen this kind of scene in a movie.<br/><br/>To the best of his memory, two protagonists in the movie tied a huge insurmountable enemy with a rope, then struck his head with bricks, but this time the enemy facing Sgt. First Class Kang was different.<br/><br/>Wuuuuhh!<br/><br/>The Giant Troll kept shouting.<br/><br/>Could he beat the five-meter long Giant? No, it would be impossible.<br/><br/>Since such a huge monster was moving very slowly, they could not deal with him with a traditional attack.<br/><br/>The Giant Troll seemed to be much stronger than Sgt. Kang thought.<br/><br/>“Damn it. We don’t have any time to delay the attack.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo also heard the terrible sound of the rope being split. Obviously, the ten climbing ropes that could withstand two tons of force gradually became loose.<br/><br/>The splitting noise of the ropes sounded like the countdown of a bomb explosion in Sungwoo’s ears.<br/><br/>There was not much time. After all, the zombies and Werebear skeletons rushed toward the boss monster and tore apart his skin with their nails and claws.<br/><br/>Kuuuuh!<br/><br/>Swinging his hands wildly, the Giant Troll defended himself and counterattacked them. However, his counterattack was not intimidating because he, who fell to the ground, could not twist his body due to the ropes. </div><h2 id="chapter67">Chapter 67</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            The intense fighting between them looked like a herd of hyenas attacking a giant herbivore.<br/><br/>The runway was quickly covered with blood, but strangely enough, the Giant Troll’s wounds were being healed at a tremendous rate.<br/><br/>‘Yeah, he must be a troll. He has a regeneration power that even surpasses vampires…’<br/><br/>Wudddduk ―<br/><br/>When the Giant Troll fully inflated his muscles, the bundle of ropes tightened almost to the point of breaking.<br/><br/>‘We have no time.’<br/><br/>As things stood now, the boss monster would be freed from the tight ropes. Obviously, he would try to crush them all at once.<br/><br/>“Let’s start attacking!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/>“Sure!”<br/><br/>While rushing toward the monster, Sungwoo deactivated the summoning of one Werewolf Skeleton. At that moment, the skeleton fell to the ground immediately.<br/><br/>‘Weapon Production.’<br/><br/>Then, based on the skeleton’s body, Sungwoo activated the skill, ‘Bone Weapon Production.’<br/><br/>As soon as he did so, all kinds of bones disassembled in all directions, creating five spears.<br/><br/>Other skeletons picked up the weapons.<br/><br/>-‘Synergy effect’ is activated due to team play.<br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wild Hunter (Level 1)<br/><br/>-Category: Weapon Synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: 5 or more spears required.<br/><br/>-Effect: Penetrative power increases. (+30%)<br/><br/>Last night, Sungwoo studied the synergy effects in advance by holding all weapons alternately; those efforts now paid off nicely.<br/><br/>Without it, he wouldn’t have known that there was something like a “penetrative power” because he had never seen the synergy of spears before.<br/><br/>Besides, the Giant Troll’s defensive power was greatly reduced thanks to the effects of the four Werebears’ Wild Tyrant (Phase 1) that reduced the opponent’s defense (-10%) and increase of the ally’s defense (+10%).<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>The sharp poles of the five spears penetrated the Giant Troll’s skin like an awl.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuh!<br/><br/>The boss monster’s screams changed quite a bit. It wasn’t an angry cry anymore, but a painful groan from deep inside.<br/><br/>Now, Sungwoo climbed over his chest and faced his huge head. The monster no longer shook his head to avoid Sungwoo, and half of his eyes had already been turned inside out.<br/><br/>Given the monster’s regenerating power, Sungwoo was not sure when the monster would come to his senses again after healing.<br/><br/>‘He has been completely neutralized. I can smash him with one more strike.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo grabbed his warrior’s sword, the “Lost Sword of the Master,” with both hands, and stabbed the monster’s chin from the underside.<br/><br/>Sungwoo stabbed the monster’s brain, not his hard skull.<br/><br/>“I know you can’t regenerate the brain.”<br/><br/>Finally, the monster’s eyes were completely turned inside out.<br/><br/>-You have earned 220,000 gold by hunting the local boss monster ‘Giant Troll’.<br/><br/>-You have earned an increase in all your stats as a special reward for hunting the mainstream boss monster. (+2)<br/><br/>-You have obtained a ‘Special Item Box’ as a special reward for hunting the mainstream boss monster.<br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 11)<br/><br/>Sungwoo slowly pulled out the sword. Since he was the strongest monster in this area, it was natural that Sungwoo obtained such a huge reward.<br/><br/>-Time remaining until you prove your qualifications: 4,851 days<br/><br/>He decreased the duration by 98 days by killing the boss monster.<br/><br/>-Choose your Level Up card.<br/><br/>Stats (random)<br/><br/>Skill (random)<br/><br/>Items (random)<br/><br/>Other (random)<br/><br/>Skill: Bone weapon manufacturing (confirmed)<br/><br/>‘Bone weapon manufacturing is confirmed? If so, is my skill being upgraded now?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo chose item 5.<br/><br/>“No way! He’s already finished the fight?”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sgt. First Class Kang was standing awkwardly right beside the Giant Troll’s feet.<br/><br/>As if he was ready for the fight, his arms were tight.<br/><br/>However, the fighting was over even before he joined it. His fighting spirit was gone in an instant, and his face, full of pride and conceit, stiffened right away.<br/><br/>“It seems like my contract with the military is over with this fight. Let me take the corpse of this monster. I clearly told you I would only kill the monster and deal with its corpse.”<br/><br/>Although Sungwoo could not resurrect the monster as his subordinate, the troll’s blood and leather were valuable items.<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang just looked at him without replying then looked sideways at the building behind him. Corporal Choi’s squad was stationed there to carry out a surprise attack against Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Even Sgt. Kim’s squad was approaching behind him. If he decided to order them, the 20 players of the two squads would attack Sungwoo simultaneously.<br/><br/>But could they win?<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang agonized, ‘What should I do? If they mount a surprise attack, I can rush and break his neck.’<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo who was standing on the troll’s chest walked toward him.<br/><br/>“Sgt. First Class Kang?”<br/><br/>“Ah, yes.”<br/><br/>“It seems like you have a lot of thoughts on your mind at the moment. Right?”<br/><br/>“You’re right. I do,” Sgt. Kang replied, ready to attack him.<br/><br/>“It’s too late if you can’t think straight now.”<br/><br/>‘What the heck?’ Sgt. Kang pondered over how to understand what he just heard.<br/><br/>‘What the heck did he mean when he said it’s too late?’<br/><br/>At that moment, bones arose from the left hand of the Giant Troll and flew toward Sungwoo’s face. They turned into a helmet that covered Sungwoo’s neck and entire head. Sungwoo just displayed the bone armor manufacturing skill.<br/><br/>‘It’s too late.’<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang hit the ground suddenly and shouted, “Attack him!”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang was a Level 9 striker. Since he invested most of the Level Up cards in stats, the level of his physical strength reached 20, which was four times higher than his initial stats.<br/><br/>Sungwoo also had the skill “Brawl” that he acquired with a link card that he had selected during the 2nd card selection session. While the skill lasts, it strengthened his physical strength and stamina by 30 percent. It was no exaggeration that he killed the Orc by breaking its neck the other day.<br/><br/>But Sgt. Kang ignored his power and recklessly rushed to him, vowing, ‘I can strike him down with just one blow.’<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang broke through the Werebear Skeletons with one big jump.<br/><br/>Then, he threw his punch at Sungwoo’s head.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>In fact, what Sgt. Kang punched was not Sungwoo’ body but the shield he made with the troll’s forearm bones.<br/><br/>“What the heck?”<br/><br/>His powerful punch missed the target.<br/><br/>At that moment, something struck Sgt. Kang’s head hard. It was the heavy forefoot of the Werebear skeleton that hit his head, whose body was thrown into the air before falling down on the asphalt miserably.<br/><br/>“What a shield! Very useful,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Sungwoo put down the cracked bone shield. He reinforced his existing skill further by using the ‘Bone Weapon Manufacturing’ skill, and the bone shield was added to the list of weapons that he could manufacture.<br/><br/>The moment Sgt. Kang rushed to him, Sungwoo immediately made the shield by triggering his skill on the Giant Troll’s right hand.<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang twisted himself on the hard asphalt. No matter how much he reinforced his physical strength, he could not help but curl up because of the sharp pain.<br/><br/>But he was a soldier, and a special forces member who went through the toughest training the army had.<br/><br/>He stood up straight, rolled back and stepped back away from Sungwoo.<br/><br/>‘Damn it. I was too hasty. I should have moved together with the two squads. By the way, didn’t Corporal Choi’s squad move?”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang turned his head with some hope. This time he tried to order Sgt. Kim’s squad nearby.<br/><br/>“Sgt. Kim!”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kim and his squad members were not ready for the battle at all. Moreover, they seemed to have no intention of fighting at all.<br/><br/>“Sgt. Kim? Why won’t you reply?”<br/><br/>“Do you really need to hear my reply?” said Sgt. Kim with a sigh.<br/><br/>“What the hell did you say?”<br/><br/>“Just say it. You can just talk to me even if you don’t hear my reply, right? Just tell me what you want to say.”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang’s face turned white at his arrogant reply.<br/><br/>“You son of a bitch! What the heck are you doing now? Are you challenging me?”<br/><br/>“Sgt. Kang, we have decided to survive here. We don’t want to lose our lives in this worthless battle.”<br/><br/>Then, Sgt. Kim looked at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Ugh? Hahaha! You want to survive? You must be crazy to say that.”<br/><br/>“Well, we don’t want to sacrifice ourselves without knowing the purpose. What are we trying to defend now? I don’t feel we’re doing something worthwhile now.”<br/><br/>“Sgt. Kim is right!” One of his squad members chimed in.<br/><br/>“I can’t stand this anymore!” Another shouted.<br/><br/>Other members of his squad all agreed with Sgt. Kim. So many fellow soldiers had been killed while carrying out their superior officer’s ridiculous orders, so they could not stand it anymore.<br/><br/>“I’ve also persuaded Corporal Choi out of this operation.”<br/><br/>At that moment, Corporal Choi’s squad members were coming out of the building. All armed with crossbows and were synergistic; they were sort of a sniper force.<br/><br/>To their surprise, their company commander, Captain Lee, was being taken out, with his hands tied. Captain Lee looked at Sgt. Kim and sighed. </div><h2 id="chapter68">Chapter 68</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “Sgt. Kim, I understand your feelings. But should you have done this to me? We can’t survive without the support of the military. Look at what’s going on in this country!” Captain Lee shouted.<br/><br/>“Captain Lee, many of us were already killed. We’re going to stop these kinds of silly military operations and do our best to survive.”<br/><br/>“Do you think the regiment commander will forgive you? Don’t you know that if you get out of the military, you get a penalty, let alone synergy?”<br/><br/>‘Penalty?’<br/><br/>“Well, we couldn’t obey the order, but outsiders can set us free.”<br/><br/>“Outsiders?”<br/><br/>The company commander turned his head and looked at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Bullshit! All you have to do is just keep collecting gold and give it to me. Then, I will take care of everything, you dumbhead!”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang still seemed not to have lost the will to fight. He muttered alone, then took a small case out of his pocket.<br/><br/>“I really didn’t want to use this.”<br/><br/>“I warned you against it! Hey, Sgt. First Class Kang!”<br/><br/>Captain Lee was frightened by his actions. But Sgt. Kang pulled out an unknown syringe from the case and injected it in his arm. Something like intravenous fluids flowed into his arm.<br/><br/>“You shut up! You keep rambling without any action! Damn it! You should have kept your squad members under control.”<br/><br/>Nobody knew what was in the syringe, but Sgt. Kang began struggling in pain.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>Subsequently, they could see a vein protruding from his forearm. It was clear that his body was going through some sort of change.<br/><br/>“Hey, stop him right now! That’s the ‘transformation ampoule’! If that explodes…”<br/><br/>“Ahah! Hey, shut up!” Sgt. Kang shouted.<br/><br/>‘Transformation ampoule? It referred to the transformation of those who did not pick an occupation card. How can they control it?’<br/><br/>But even before Sungwoo came out to stop him, Sgt. Kang moved first. He jumped off the ground and rushed at Captain Lee. Then, he slashed Captain Lee’s neck in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>Suddenly, his body was plump with newly grown fur, and sharp claws grew from the tips of his long fingers.<br/><br/>Captain Lee’s throat was cut, blood gushed like a waterfall.<br/><br/>“Aaaah!”<br/><br/>“Damn it! Stand back!”<br/><br/>Corporal Choi’s squad members quickly stepped back, but Sgt. First Class Kang’s target was not them.<br/><br/>“You, son of a bitch! Kuaaaah!”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang turned right away and rushed to Sgt. Kim. Sgt. Kim picked up the sword immediately, but Sgt. Kang was faster than him.<br/><br/>But at that moment, someone pulled Sgt. Kim’s shoulder and jumped forward. She was Jisu.<br/><br/>She grabbed the handle of the sword and confronted Sgt. Kang head on.<br/><br/>Sgt. Kang’s foot flew towards her head. However, Jisu lowered her body to avoid his foot. Several strands of her hair were cut off by his toenails. That was all.<br/><br/>She jumped off the ground and cut him in the ribs.<br/><br/>Blood gushed from his ribs, sparks arose and began to burn Sgt. Kang’s military uniform.<br/><br/>When Sgt. Kang twisted, startled, she turned behind him and swung her sword from the right side.<br/><br/>This time she targeted his right thigh.<br/><br/>The moment she swung the sword, he staggered violently.<br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/>However, she couldn’t avoid his kick. His back kick hit her abdomen.<br/><br/>With her bone armor shattering, her body was thrown into the air and fell to the side of the Giant Troll.<br/><br/>“Ugh! Haah… Haah!”<br/><br/>She grabbed her belly and gasped for breath. Even though she was hit just once by Sgt. Kang, she felt like she had been hit by a much greater force.<br/><br/>Right at that moment, Sungwoo jumped down from the troll’s body.<br/><br/>“What a great attack! Now, I can beat you easily.”<br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo said that, the Werebear skeletons stepped forward.<br/><br/>“Urgh! Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>Sgt. First Class Kang made a fuss to put out the fire on his uniform. Even during that moment, his body was swelling. Orange fur covered his neck and back, and the shape of his skull changed. There was even a defined black pattern on his forehead.<br/><br/>“Weretiger?”<br/><br/>He transformed into a giant tiger.<br/><br/>“Oh, I can obtain another good skeleton.”<br/><br/>The four Werebears started hunting the tiger.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Lieutenant Colonel Park was sipping hot black coffee in front of the convenience store in front of the front gate of the 10th Fighter Wing.<br/><br/>“It doesn’t taste good.”<br/><br/>Since he used to enjoy coffee brewed with a high-quality coffee machine in his office, he frowned at the instant coffee he was sipping now. It seemed that his deputy who was killed on the first day brewed coffee very well.<br/><br/>“Battalion commander, our soldiers are coming back.”<br/><br/>“Oh…”<br/><br/>He stood up when a young officer reported to him. Like he said, a group of soldiers were entering the main gate, headed straight to the convenience store.<br/><br/>At the forefront was Sgt. Kim. The soldiers stopped at the convenience store, and only Sgt. Kim opened the door and entered.<br/><br/>He didn’t salute, but Lieutenant Colonel Park didn’t care about it and asked in a hurry, “Did you succeed?”<br/><br/>“We killed the boss monster.”<br/><br/>“Great. Wonderful. What about Sgt. First Class Kang? What about Captain Lee?”<br/><br/>Only then did Lieutenant Colonel Park notice that not Sgt. Kang and Captain Lee, but Sgt. Kim was reporting to him.<br/><br/>“Both were killed.”<br/><br/>“What the heck… What about that guy?” asked Sgt. Kang, referring to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>At that moment, a chime rang and a man in white bone armor appeared before them.<br/><br/>“Have a seat!”<br/><br/>He dragged a chair, then sat down before Lieutenant Colonel Park. Staring blankly at his face, Lieutenant Colonel Park slowly sat down in his chair.<br/><br/>“This time let me give you a suggestion.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“You said you had the regiment commander as your supervisor, right?”<br/><br/>Lieutenant Colonel Park nodded reluctantly with a stiff expression. “Yes, that’s right.”<br/><br/>“According to the group quest, you donate all the collected gold to that commander, right?”<br/><br/>“Well, I don’t have to ask how you came to know it…”<br/><br/>Full of anger, Lieutenant Colonel Park stared at Sgt. Kim at that moment. But Sgt Kim faced him without being disturbed.<br/><br/>“Is it you who ordered Sgt. Kang to kill me? Or the regiment commander? If you don’t tell me honestly, I’ll kill you here right away.”<br/><br/>“Well, it’s the regiment commander who gives the orders.”<br/><br/>“Then, synergy must have been given to that commander, right?”<br/><br/>Sgt. Kim once told Sungwoo that on the first day this happened, his unit members drove out the monsters, resulting in huge casualties of his members.<br/><br/>But what mattered more was what happened after that.<br/><br/>At first, everyone responded as one, but when they went through the harrowing battle with the monsters, it was difficult to maintain the discipline and hierarchy of his unit.<br/><br/>Right at that moment, a strange synergy came into play.<br/><br/>-‘Hidden Synergy’ is given as a reward for the bloody group fighting.<br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/>Loyal Thorny Road (hidden)<br/> -Category: Special Dynergy<br/><br/>-Condition: certain conditions are satisfied<br/><br/>-Effect: Your commander is given the title ‘Legatus.’ The commander can give you any orders. If you disobey, you are given a ‘penalty,’ which limits all your stats, and feels like an intolerable pain.<br/><br/>*’Group Quest’ is given at 6 am every day. When you clear the quest, you get the buff effect for a certain period of time.<br/><br/>*If you reject the order and leave the area, you will be converted to an ‘AWOL.’ Right after you’re given the penalty of a ‘remnant soldier,’ you will be hunted persistently by nearby monsters.<br/><br/>That was a really unfortunate event. It was like having a harder and more painful collar around one’s neck. Some soldiers deserted the unit after ignoring the message, but all of them were found dead in a place not far away from the unit. It was obvious that they were pursued by all kinds of monsters.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“Do you have anything else to say?”<br/><br/>“It’s all for the cause of our unit.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo snorted at that and said, “Are you kidding? You once said that the so-called cause was the restoration of our country, right? So, are you relying on that system to confront the system that overthrew the country?”<br/><br/>Lieutenant Colonel Park’s remarks were contradictory. When Sungwoo retorted, Lieutenant Colonel Park himself felt confused because he could not understand the reason.<br/><br/>He despised the system of the community bulletin, saying he could not trust it, but at the same time, he actively used the system of synergy to restrain people.<br/><br/>Obviously Lieutenant Colonel Park’s actions were contradictory. Maybe this was similar to the question that Captain Lee had before his death. Lieutenant Colonel Park quickly bit his lips tightly then kept emphasizing it to himself, ‘Yes, this is necessary for the country. Sacrifice and compromise are required for the cause. Absolutely, it’s for the country.’<br/><br/>When Lieutenant Colonel Park didn’t say anything, Sungwoo got up from the chair.<br/><br/>“Then, show me to your boss, the regiment commander. I would like to suggest one thing to him. I have to see the man who can accept my suggestion.”<br/><br/>He opened the convenience store door and went out. White beasts lined up in front of him.<br/><br/>What caught his eye, in particular, was the 3-meter-tall skeleton with huge fangs, the Weretiger Skeleton.<br/><br/>Just like it was in any cataclysmic period, the force of the past was bound to surrender to the force of the present. </div><h2 id="chapter69">Chapter 69</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The military unit was destroyed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A huge number of monster bodies were piled up on the disturbed ground. On one side of the barracks, there were corpses wrapped in ponchos. They had once been soldiers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that their bodies testified that they were sacrificed to defend the unit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think there are very few troops currently available inside the unit because a company-sized unit was dispatched to crack down on the monsters for the group quest.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sgt. Kim explained, leading Sungwoo into the unit’s base. The main gate of the base was tightly closed, but no soldiers were defending it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“In fact, it is pointless to organize the remaining soldiers into a unit because there are less than two hundred left.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Normally, a regiment had a force of more than 1,500 soldiers, but there were only 200 survivors at the moment, which testified how many soldiers were sacrificed in the process of fighting the monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sgt. Kim said that as soon as the game started, up to one hundred goblins raided the battalion barracks. Considering that there was only one goblin Sungwoo encountered, it was easy to imagine how big the goblins were.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Their raid was like a surprise attack on a major military base. I don’t know who’s doing this, but come to think of it, it seemed that they wanted to smash the military base as if they intended to ruin us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded, “That makes sense. They might have planned on it right after they incapaciated the weapons in the unit.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The survival game began with the human military being completely extinguished. The game was designed that way from the beginning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that because they survived this tremendously difficult extermination plan, they were given the odd synergy called “Thorny Path of Loyalty” as a special reward. This game had always been like that. Variables created variables.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Here it is.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sgt. Kim and Sungwoo arrived at the headquarters building of the base.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No one was guarding the guard post at the main gate, but there were some guards there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that all the troops were standing on guard at the headquarters because they could not guard the outside of the base properly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who is it?” A private first class soldier pulled out his sword and shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A corporal standing next to him lifted his crossbow and aimed at the party.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, you guys put down your weapons and stick to the wall!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Before introducing himself, Sungwoo had the skeletons step forward to show their strength. At first glance, the guards were no match for the large skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh! What the heck are they?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, battalion commander?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, aren’t you Sgt. Kim of the 1st Company?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The guards immediately recognized the soldiers in Sungwoo’s group.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sgt. Kim approached the guards and said, “Come on, put down your weapons, and stick to the wall as directed.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sgt. Kim persuaded the soldiers, all of them at the headquarters made the way for them helplessly. They had no choice but to get out of their way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they arrived on the third floor of the headquarters, 12 security guards were guarding the entrance to the regiment commander’s office.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo appeared with the giant skeletons, the guards looked at each other and immediately asked for help.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please spare our lives!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We won’t harm you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They abandoned their weapons and surrendered. Since they were the direct subordinates of the regiment commander, they had low morale and little fighting spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, even with this ragtag band of soldiers, they could control any rebellion because of the ‘penalty’ that the regiment commander could impose. In fact, the penalty system of the army was very disorganized in most cases.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sgt. Kim, tie all these soldiers together and put them in one place. Lieutenant Colonel Park, you go in first.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even in that situation, Lieutenant Colonel Park kept his mouth shut.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had him go into the regiment commander’s office.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please have tea.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as he entered the office, Sungwoo had the two Werewolf skeletons step into the office to show his power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, even in such a situation, the regiment commander treated Sungwoo to tea by ordering his deputy in an ostentatious show of his inflated pride.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t even look at the teacup and crossed his legs. He had no intention of sipping tea with the very guy who tried to kill him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I didn’t expect my soldiers to commit treason,” said the commander.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his eyes and looked at the crossbow on his desk. He momentarily wondered if the commander wanted to threaten him with that ridiculous weapon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Lieutenant Colonel Park, haven’t you noticed it? Huh? You must have felt something strange. Don’t you think this situation is so embarrassing and shameful?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sorry.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lieutenant Colonel Park was standing to the left of the regiment commander, with his head lowered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo opened his mouth, “How ridiculous you are!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“From my point of view it seems that you have a big problem if you want to find fault with the soldiers and blame them for betraying you when you actually drove all of them who wanted to survive into a deadly situation.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the commander snorted, locking his fingers together.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did I drive them into a deadly corner? Are you kidding? It was a military operation.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After he moistened his lips with tea, he continued, “It was because our initial response was quick that we survived. I immediately dispatched my soldiers into the monster cave within the base and got rid of all the monsters even though the fighting dragged on. I also found a new way to recover their broken morale.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, was the new way the synergy you obtained by chance? So, you controlled your soldiers by force if they didn’t follow your orders, then had them suffer burning pain, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, the commander was getting more and more upset.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As a result, I could establish a defensive position at the headquarters. Other bases?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Well, other regiments and the Marine Corps headquarters nearby also failed to defend their garrisons. This is a war. It is only natural to send the soldiers to the battlefield, even if they have to point their guns at friendly forces.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo shook his head, leaning his back against the sofa and said, “No. This has nothing to do with a war.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck are you talking about?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who are you fighting against? Do you think your opponent is at war with you, too?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The regiment commander was speechless.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s just a survival game. We’re like horses on the chessboard.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, let me get to the point. At first, you asked for my cooperation, then I was told that you ordered your soldiers to kill me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The commander calmly nodded and replied, “That’s true because you are going to be a big headache to me someday.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘How could he respond so brazenly in a situation like this?’ Sungwoo thought he was so shameless and brazen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you are brazen enough to say that to me, you still have the intention of killing me if I don’t follow your will, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, it’s because that’s the right way. Someone like you is a potential tumor cell in this country. Not only you, but all the guys who create private organizations, including the Yongdungpo Prosecutor, must be removed.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo found a tough stubbornness as well as his strong will in his stern gaze.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. As I mentioned earlier, if you liberate the soldiers wishing to be freed from the synergy and hand the gold back to me, I will leave this area after the mainstream ends. After that, you can take care of this town by yourself.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, he could not guarantee he would keep the promise, but he said it to get the gold from him smoothly. He could not take gold from corpses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Deep anger was clearly visible in the eyes of the regiment commander, but he helplessly nodded. He was aware that Sungwoo had the upper hand in the current negotiations. He had no other choice at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How much gold do you want?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“All of it. Give me all the gold you received after your soldiers were done with the group quest.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. Then, as you promised, you have to leave the areas of Hwaseong and Suwon. But can’t you leave the soldiers behind? I need them. I really need them to defend Hwaseong City.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo shook his head firmly, “No. I don’t want to negotiate with you unless you confirm that you deactivate that vicious synergy. If our negotiation breaks down, I might have to fight you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s announcement was a clear threat. At that moment, it seemed that the skeletons behind him were moving a bit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it. Alright. Come here and hold my hand.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They needed to make physical contact to exchange gold. The commander reached out to Sungwoo, but he shook his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No. Can you come this way?” </div><h2 id="chapter70">Chapter 70</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>It wasn’t just a matter of pride. Sungwoo was bothered not only by the crossbow on the commander’s desk, but also he had to be concerned about the possibility that the commander hid weapons under the desk.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The commander hesitated for a moment. Sungwoo was not sure whether he had bad intentions or he needed some time to control his pride, but he hesitated for a moment before standing up. Then, he slowly walked toward Sungwoo and reached out his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Opponent’s Gold: 45,688<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to Sgt. Kim, when the soldiers completed the ‘group quest’ assigned to them on a daily basis, the compensation was paid only to the regiment commander.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In addition, the middle-level officers collected the gold from the monster crackdown team obtained by beating the monsters, but a significant amount of that was donated to the regiment commander.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This commander has taken a huge amount of gold. How come it’s so small?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, the amount of gold that the commander possessed now was surprisingly small.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, is it true that Sungwoo was gaining an overwhelmingly large amount of gold?<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have received 45,688 gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s ask you one more thing. Where did you obtain the “Transformation Ampoule” that Sgt. First Class Kang had?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sgt. First Class Kang transformed into a Weretiger after injecting it into his arm. Given that Captain Lee was frightened to see that right before his death, the military officers including the commander seemed to know where it came from.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why should I tell you about that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, if you don’t tell me, I might change my mind and just stay in this area. In fact, I have not decided on any specific area to depart for.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo already received all the gold from him, so he had the nerve to tell him whatever he wanted to. Then, the commander put his hand into his pocket and sighed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how politely Sungwoo spoke to him, the commander had to take his warning seriously because of the two giant skeletons standing in front of him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know their identity either. They called themselves ‘door-to-door vendors.’ They offered to sell me items that I could not buy at the store, so I just bought a few of them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The commander began to reveal what he knew without any resistance. While he was talking, the commander looked at Sungwoo and the skeletons alternately, trying to check something. Obviously, he was nervous at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt something suspicious about his reply.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Door-to-door vendors? Where are they?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The commander shook his head, “I don’t know either. I also asked them about lots of things, but they didn’t answer. They were weird and sly. Do you want to even describe the way they were dressed?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can you think of anything specific enough to identify them, apart from their attire?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, they tried to persuade me to buy their stuff by showing me all kinds of things. But when I kept showing doubts, they told me that just relying on the coincidence of roulette was incompetent and stupid.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo frowned unwittingly because he had heard it somewhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The commander continued, “They said it was their catch phrase. They said they were striking a deal which was certainly not random. After hearing it, I decided to buy their items.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo remembered that it was the message written on the wall of the store inside the used car sales complex.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Then, are they the same guys who scrawled on the wall? Door-to-door vendors? What the heck are they doing?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stood up, trying to figure them out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me leave now. Don’t forget the synergy. I’m going to double check with Sgt. Kim about it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo bowed to the commander. As if he swallowed before he knew it, his syrinx vibrated up and down, He turned and walked toward the door.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the commander called him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, wait a minute.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a toilet in the commander’s office, where someone popped out, opening the door. Apparently, he was the commander’s deputy who left after bringing in tea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He fired a crossbow at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo blocked the crossbow. An arrow was shot into Sungwoo’s left thigh which was covered with armor made of bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I thought you would threaten my life. Although you pretended to be decent and stern, I knew your shallow eyes were trembling in a vulgar manner.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the commander failed to attack Sungwoo, his face stiffened. His deputy hurriedly began to load another arrow, and the commander reached for the crossbow placed on the desk. Lieutenant Colonel Park, standing next to him, pulled a small knife out of his pocket.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo acted faster. He lifted the repeating crossbow and fired in succession.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Urgh! Urgh! Urgh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuh”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The three collapsed immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 10,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 12,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two of them were killed on the spot. They were the commander’s deputy and Lieutenant Colonel Park.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo realized again that killing a person brought about a far greater reward than catching a monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought from the beginning that they weren’t worth being saved. However, when they tried to kill him like this, he had no other choice but to sacrifice them for the more worthwhile gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oops! Damn it!” The commander barely shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was still alive. He groaned and pulled something out of his uniform pocket.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a round object, but at first glance it looked like a grenade. Of course, it was a little different from the grenade.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t come close! This is a bomb!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Bomb?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, it’s a bomb. Do you think I have not prepared something like this for your attack? “Huh? The door-to-door sellers brought me lots of useful stuff. This is called ‘Abyssal Concentrate Capsule!’ I tested it on the Orcs. If it explodes here in this room, you and I will die immediately.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? Can you explode it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What did you say?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m curious about what kind of fragrance it will emit this time?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo slowly approached him. Abyssal Concentrate Capsule? Sungwoo seemed to be quite attracted to that word. He recalled the strong thrill that the Orc chief had once unleashed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The commander crawled back and shuddered when he saw Sungwoo approaching him without any fear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, don’t come! You are really going to be killed.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m alright. Just explode it, will you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it, you crazy guy!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The commander closed his eyes tightly and tried to throw the object called ‘Abyssal Concentrate Capsule.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cling!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the window was broken, and the Weartiger skeleton pushed his head inside. Then, he bit the commander’s arm holding the capsule.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His arm holding the capsule was torn off entirely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh! My arm! Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As expected, tigers are riding a tree very well.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Weretiger skeleton spat out the commander’s severed arm, picked out the capsule, and brought it to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Abyssal Concentrate Capsule<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Class: Unknown<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Player Manufactured Item<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: After removing the safety pin, explode the ‘Abyssal Saliva’ in the target area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: A death bomb made by concentrating the corpses of 50 Goblins and 30 Orcs.

If that’s the case, somebody has definitely made this. Which group is it? Do these guys also receive exclusive quests to sell goods?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was highly likely that those players with an incomprehensible behavior were given a weird exclusive quest, just like the Vampire Lord.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uhhhhh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you won’t use it, let me have the capsule. By the way, you are very close to the door-to-door sellers, right?” Sungwoo sarcastically asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Cough!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, you should not die yet.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Werewolf skeleton grabbed the commander’s by the neck and lifted him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanging up in the air, he was breathing roughly. Blood ran down from his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo searched all over his body while he was hanging. He collected a cell phone, a car key, and a suspicious key.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“A key?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What is the use for this key in this era? Sungwoo looked around and found a steel cabinet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He opened the cabinet door.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, this guy amassed all the gold here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He found an unexpected treasure trove.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The cabinet contained several items that the commander must have purchased from the “door-to-door vendors.” And he noticed two familiar items among them. They were the so-called ‘Transformation Ampoule.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Transformation Ampoule (Wolf)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Class: Unknown<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Player Manufactured Item<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Temporarily becomes a ‘Werewolf’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: An extract made by deeply boiling his own friend who became a beast. If you inject it into your muscle, you become a Werewolf, but don’t worry. You will recover in 20 minutes. (Manufacturer’s description.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The other one was ‘Transformation Ampoule (Bear )’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was not sure if it was true or just a joke to make the ampoule by boiling the beast man, but it was certain that the raw material of this ampoule was a beast man.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What kind of job can create something like this? And for what purpose are they making this?’ </div><h2 id="chapter71">Chapter 71</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Then, he found some ‘Abyssal Concentrate Capsules’ in the paper box inside the cabinet. There were a total of three in it.<br/><br/>He didn’t know how much the commander paid for these items, but it was certain that the commander invested in this kind of strange hobby by grilling his soldiers on the group quests.<br/><br/>“Why did you buy this stuff, uh?”<br/><br/>The regiment commander was silent. With his neck in the Weretiger’s mouth, he drooped like wet laundry.<br/><br/>-You have earned 6,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/>The commander died from excessive bleeding.<br/><br/>“This commander was only Level 3?”<br/><br/>The gold Sungwoo obtained by killing the commander was 6,000 gold. The commander obtained 1,000 gold per level. Considering that the gold amount he obtained by the current mainstream event doubled, the commander’s level was only 3, the lowest among them.<br/><br/>“Man, this guy didn’t know anything about what was going on in the outside world,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Maybe that’s why the commander bought strange stuff like the ‘Abyssal Concentrate Capsules.’ Since he himself didn’t participate in the fighting, he stayed at a low level all the time, and accordingly, he must have felt scared and nervous often.<br/><br/>It was clear that the commander played into the hands of the door-to-door sellers.<br/><br/>“He was an incompetent commander.”<br/><br/>The medals he obtained at the sacrifice of his soldiers were far from noble.<br/><br/>Sungwoo left the office which had turned into a sea of blood. Then, he confirmed that the window in the annex office was open. The miserable lieutenant of the commander seemed to have been in hiding after entering the bathroom through the window.<br/><br/>“Click, click…”<br/><br/>There were not many soldiers left behind in the base. Most of the surviving troops went outside to crack down on the monsters, so there were around 30 inside the base.<br/><br/>When they learned that their commander was dead, the soldiers were embarrassed.<br/><br/>“Now, you guys are free. The prison-like synergy that bound you until now has disappeared, so you can leave and find your families.”<br/><br/>Although they naturally dispersed, led by Sgt. Kim, many of them, hesitant to leave, looked very nervous and restless perhaps because they were bound here by the chain of command for too long. It wasn’t clear where they went, but it was clear that they would find their journey back home difficult.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Yongho and his party returned to the village.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, can I stay here?” Sgt. Kim asked.<br/><br/>“It doesn’t matter. Where is your house, Sgt. Kim?”<br/><br/>“It’s in Cheonan City. I can’t go home right away, and I can’t contact my family yet. It’s the same with some of my junior soldiers. We’re at a loss about what to do.”<br/><br/>Obviously, they wanted to go and see their families as soon as possible, but they could not leave the current area. It was too dangerous for them to look for their families who could not be reached.<br/><br/>“So, can we serve as the patrol guard for the village?”<br/><br/>The five soldiers who decided to stay with Sgt. Kim had combat experience, so their level was high enough. Among the players the five soldiers were highly reliable. So, Sungwoo decided to let Sgt. Kim and his deputy, Inho Kim, take care of defending the village.<br/><br/>Sungwoo needed to monitor the neighborhood at all times in order to prevent the recurrence of a Werebear raid.<br/><br/>Sungwoo could relax a bit after such a long time. He prepared to open the item box in the business director’s office of the museum.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Special Item Box<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: Event item<br/><br/>-Effect: 1 type of item is given at random upon opening.<br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled out a metal case as small as his palm from his pocket. This was a box that he could not obtain at the shop. He had acquired it after killing the boss monster in this area.<br/><br/>‘Is this also a random box?’<br/><br/>He unlocked the case and slowly opened it. Then, the light came out the box, creating a strange phenomenon. The light dyed the air, and an item dropped from the light.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Shadow King’s Robe<br/><br/>-Grade: Legendary<br/><br/>-Category: Coat<br/><br/>-Effect: Magic damage reduction (-10%). You can hide yourself when you’re in the shadow. (When attacking an opponent, you will reveal yourself, and you can be detected by detection skills.)<br/><br/>It was a dark green thick robe. It was long enough to cover the whole body and equipped with a hood. Come to think of it, it was also the first clothing item Sungwoo obtained.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, my mom developed a new recipe. Come down and try it. Uh? What is that?” asked Hanho.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was wearing a dark green robe and adjusting the hood. Watching him, Hanho touched the hood that he obtained right after he moved up to Level 2.<br/><br/>Hanho’s item, which Sungwoo described as something like a poncho, had an option that the probability of him hiding himself from a monster increased by 50%, but he didn’t see the kind of light Sungwoo had just seen.<br/><br/>“I have something similar to this, but what a difference! Wow, that looks so gorgeous,” said Hanho, feeling a bit regretful.<br/><br/>“Thanks. Enjoy the dish first. Let me come down a little later.”<br/><br/>Hanho was about to close the door when he suddenly turned around.<br/><br/>“By the way, Sungwoo, we’ve got only three days to go before this mainstream is over. What shall we do until then?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo answered without hesitation, “We have to hunt the monsters, of course.”<br/><br/>“Aha…”<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Three days passed.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Sungwoo cracked down on the monster villages and dungeons inside the town. His crackdown unit, organized in two teams achieved great results, levelling up to level 7 on average.<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party were a little higher than that. Hanho was level 9 and Jisu was level 10.<br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 12)<br/><br/>On the last day, when they destroyed the Kobold herd in the nearby church, Sungwoo finally reached level 12.<br/><br/>“When can I reach level 15 if I keep going on at this rate?”<br/><br/>The first condition for the “exclusive quest” of the discovery of the deadly scythe was level 15. It took three full days for Sungwoo to reach level 12, so it would be more difficult to achieve that higher level from now on.<br/><br/>-Choose your level up card.<br/><br/>Stats (random)<br/><br/>Skill (random)<br/><br/>Item (random)<br/><br/>Other (random)<br/><br/>Increased physical strength by 3 (confirmed)<br/><br/>Just like when he discovered it after getting out of the school, Sungwoo noticed the confirmed item that would increase his physical strength by 3. He naturally chose item number 5.<br/><br/>-Your physical strength increased. (+3)<br/><br/>When his physical strength reached 13 (+6), he could easily twist the legs of a steel chair with his bare hands.<br/><br/>Then, a vibration rang inside his pocket.<br/><br/>“Oh, I think I should mute the sound.”<br/><br/>The vibrations went on for some time, triggered by the secret contact community bulletin posts as well as a warning to those going to the Safety Zone.<br/><br/>[12] Let’s go to the Safety Zone carefully.<br/><br/>-Author: kor-157 │ Hit: 17,456<br/><br/><br/><br/>「Comments: 112」<br/><br/>There were currently 112 comments on this post and counting.<br/><br/>When the message spread that Sungwoo was right, and he saved people, those who posted comments were reevaluating the original posts related to him. They were even trying to take revenge on those who posted negative comments.<br/><br/>In addition, the ritual of the “pilgrimage to the holy land,” which was a popular term widely used on the internet, was also going on. It referred to someone posting a comment about any specific topic on the blog.<br/><br/>─ Kim Gyeong-chan123: As ID 157 said, let’s not trust people or judge them carelessly. It’s good that he realized it early. In that sense, I would like to take ‘the pilgrimage to the holy land.’<br/><br/>─ Gumi [email protected] Please save me: I will also take ‘the pilgrimage to the holy land.’ Please save them. Please help our mother and father come back alive.<br/><br/>─ Gambler Park: I would also like to take ‘the pilgrimage to the hold land’. Please help me pick the next item #1!<br/><br/>─ Local archer: Honestly, isn’t this man a real hero? I don’t know why they praise Yongdungpo Prosecutor, instead of this man, so much. In that respect, let me take ‘the pilgrimage to the holy land.’^^<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not understand how they could post such frivolous comments in this urgent situation.<br/><br/>‘It is clear that only strange people survived.’<br/><br/>Of course, those comments and posts about looking for their families were constantly coming up. However, most of the comments were the same, and they kept coming up for several days. Those who couldn’t find their families had to start a new life somewhere.<br/><br/>That was the same case with the survivors left behind in the village. They were assigned a new role for their new lives. </div><h2 id="chapter72">Chapter 72</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Sgt. Kim and Inho Kim’s security patrol stood guard on the roof of the museum. They had a siren loudspeaker ready so they could send out a warning signal whenever monsters appeared.<br/><br/>On the rooftop they were watching the survivors moving around the museum building.<br/><br/>“Ah, if you separate it from there, you can’t use that leather. Just cut out this end and then…”<br/><br/>Those who chose jobs such as tanners or blacksmiths set up workbenches on one side of the square.<br/><br/>They were in the thick of dismantling the corpses of the monsters hunted by the crackdown team into fur and leather, but since they were inexperienced, they discussed the best solution.<br/><br/>“I think you have peeled it off pretty well this time.”<br/><br/>“Let me take a look. Oh, it’s the best. You can make armor with this. I hear they haven’t found the store yet, but I hope this armor will be helpful to the monster crackdown team.”<br/><br/>The leather they pulled out was reinforced with special effects such as physical and magic defense.<br/><br/>Someday, they were going to peel off the skin of the “Giant Troll”, but they were not skilled enough to do it now. So, after extracting only the blood from the troll’s body, they hid it in the hangar of the squadron.<br/><br/>On the one hand, Hanho’s mother, Eunhee, worked with those in food-related occupational groups to study how to dismantle and cook meat by its parts.<br/><br/>“When we cook this, I think the bad fat smell of the meat will be gone, but if you don’t pay attention, you can’t keep the buff effect in the food.”<br/><br/>“Right. In the end, it seems that food is delicious only when you make it with plenty of affection. Shall we roast it now?”<br/><br/>It was also one of the cooks’ routines to provide food with a good buff effect to those going out on a monster crackdown mission.<br/><br/>Thanks to the full support of monster leather armor and food with buff effect, the monster crackdown unit could keep going on a stable hunts.<br/><br/>“Kyongsu, we’re done giving the briefing by the 2nd team. We’re going to go hunting in the direction of Paldalmun Gate in the early morning tomorrow.”<br/><br/>The crackdown team, whose members were covered with blood, returned to the headquarters and reported to Kyongsu. Sitting at the front desk, he gave them recovery potions.<br/><br/>“Thank you. Oh, we have found a new dungeon. It’s near the shopping street at the intersection, and it’s like a spider dungeon. I think we can take control of it without Sungwoo’s help. I’ll explain later.”<br/><br/>“Okay. Fortunately, no one was injured today. Have a good rest.”<br/><br/>Searching for special areas such as a dungeons or a shop was also one of the essential tasks of the crackdown team. Since someone destroyed the nearest store, they could not buy items, no matter how much money they had.<br/><br/>Sungwoo left the job of locating them to Taesung and his friends who were very familiar with the places here. Besides, they also had motorcycles.<br/><br/>“Captain, I couldn’t even find a store icon in the north. Tomorrow, let me search around the alleyways instead of the main street.”<br/><br/>“Sure. Be careful when you sneak into the alley.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s allies were prepared for attacks like this. It seemed that they restored stability to the environment. Of course, they were much more stable and secure before the game started, but obviously, they felt more relieved and secure now compared with the situation several days ago when they could not sleep from fear.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was on edge.<br/><br/>‘There is no chance that this game will allow this so easily.’<br/><br/>The 7th day was already approaching after the mainstream started.<br/><br/>After checking the time, Sungwoo waited for the end of the first mainstream. The minute hand approached midnight.<br/><br/>And a little later there appeared a message before his eyes.<br/><br/>-As of now, the mainstream ‘CHAPTER 1: Long and Dark Night Ever’ has ended.<br/><br/>* Gold acquisition double event has ended.<br/><br/>* Restrictions on area movement have been lifted.<br/><br/>The game was finally over.<br/><br/>And a new announcement came up.<br/><br/>[Mainstream start guide]<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is the beginning again.”<br/><br/>“What the hell is it this time?”<br/><br/>Everyone gossiped, looking at the message.<br/><br/>Sungwoo focused on two phrases in the long message.<br/><br/>First, ‘Raid Boss.’<br/><br/>Second, ‘Angel and Devil.’<br/><br/>‘These two are the key phrases of this mainstream…’<br/><br/>At that moment, Hanho called him., “Sungwo, can you check the app!”<br/><br/>“Why?”<br/><br/>“The rankings just opened! Regional rankings!”<br/><br/>Ranking?<br/><br/>Come to think of it, there was a category called ranking in the .<br/><br/>However, until now he could not get access to it because of the sign ‘count underway.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately ran the application.<br/><br/>━ Player Guidebook<br/><br/>[1. Public Notice (NEW)]<br/><br/>[2. Player ranking (count completed)]<br/><br/>[3. Free Bulletin]<br/><br/>[4. Auction house]<br/><br/>[5. Demon camp only (no permission)]<br/><br/>[6. Angel camp only (no permission)]<br/><br/>[7. Private broadcasting station (in preparation)]<br/><br/>Number 2, counting completed, was open.<br/><br/>[KOR Server Ranking (Page 1)]<br/><br/>Han Gangseok (LV. 15)<br/><br/>Youngdungpo Prosecutor (LV. 13)<br/><br/>kor-157 (LV. 12)<br/><br/>DOCTOR-000 (LV. 12)<br/><br/>DOCTOR-002 (LV. 12)<br/><br/>The first page revealed those who were in the top five level then 15 people were revealed in the next three pages.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was ranked third on the Korean server. In addition, Youngdungpo Prosecutor, a familiar nickname, was ranked second.<br/><br/>‘The top guy’s level is 15? How did he get it?’<br/><br/>No matter how much Sunwoo thought about, Level 15 was something he could not achieve.<br/><br/>It took a full three days for Sungwoo to move from level 11 to level 12.<br/><br/>On one hand, he could not help but pay attention to those in the 4th and 5th places who had matching nicknames. Maybe they found it very shocking to have two top rankers in the same group.<br/><br/>‘Doctor?’<br/><br/>When Sungwoo was pondering over it, Hanho began to make a big fuss again.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo! Look at the community bulletin!”<br/><br/>“What the heck is that? Don’t overreact.”<br/><br/>“The guy in the 2nd place, Youngdungpo Prosecutor, says he is going to come here…”<br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/>“He posted a comment in the community bulletin, saying he wants to see you.”<br/><br/>Youngdungpo Prosecutor, the top person of the Korean server, wanted to see Sungwoo? He wanted to come right now when the area restrictions were lifted?<br/><br/>“It seems like that guy is trying to attack us.”<br/><br/>When somebody decided to act, there is a reason for it.<br/><br/>In this era, when civilization has collapsed, there was no altruistic reason.<br/><br/>The reason why the Youngdungpo Prosecutor was coming to see Sungwoo was because he wanted something from Sungwoo.<br/><br/>‘The vampires were trying to get rid of the obstruction…’<br/><br/>The soldiers asked Sungwoo to join the army.<br/><br/>“Man, it seems we are getting into trouble again.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo already began to feel a headache. What did he want? How would he respond if Sungwoo rejected his offer?<br/><br/>He immediately confirmed the comment posted by Youngdungpo Prosecutor.<br/><br/>[38] kor- ID 157, I’m requesting an official meeting with you.<br/><br/>-Author: Youngdungpo Prosecutor │ Hit: 397,456<br/><br/>ID kor-157, I’m requesting an official meeting with you on behalf of the ‘Liberation’ Guild.<br/><br/>The Liberation Guild was the first and best survivor community in Korea with 500 players.

If you join, I, the guild master, Youngdungpo Prosecutor, would like to visit and explain the vision of our guild in person. Please accept the meeting.<br/><br/>「Comment: 92」<br/><br/>The comments began with anticipation of the meeting between the two and ended with praise. It was a turbulent time, so Sungwoo could feel people were hoping for a hero. </div><h2 id="chapter73">Chapter 73</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “There is another reason.”<br/><br/>Here the question arises. Why was this guy Youngdungpo Prosecutor anxious to see Sungwoo so urgently? As soon as area restrictions had been lifted, he wanted to see Sungwoo. For what?<br/><br/>Sungwoo seemed to figure out the reason, though.<br/><br/>‘It may be because they frequently mention me on the community bulletin.’<br/><br/>It was Sungwoo who got rid of the group of evil vampires twice, and those who witnessed his brilliant activities began to spread word about it through the community bulletin. Just like rumors, their comments about him were inflated.<br/><br/>One of them read as follows, <br/><br/>“Really? Did you see those kinds of comments?”<br/><br/>“Yes. According to the comment, the prime minister’s job is to be taken by the Youngdungpo Prosecutor. There are quite a few people who think the world of you, Sungwoo. Of course, if you look at the comments below, those supporting Youngdungpo Prosecutor are crazier.”<br/><br/>“These guys are really freaks.”<br/><br/>Hanho was proceeding with the ‘Reading Comments’ content at the moment.<br/><br/>Next to him, Jisu didn’t hide her surprise at the comments that kept popping up.<br/><br/>“Well, if they praise you without caring about how precious gold is, they seem to be really passionate about you, Sungwoo. You can even expect gifts from them.”<br/><br/>Of course, Hanho was cracking a joke, but Sungwoo’s activities were accepted as something like the “realization of justice” in the current hellish world.<br/><br/>In other words, Sungwoo’s influence was growing, although he didn’t mean for it to. Youngdungpo Prosecutor might have been wary of his growing influence.<br/><br/>‘This is not the time I can afford to get their attention like this,’ Sungwoo thought to himself.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was wary of their intense interest. Being a celebrity certainly had advantages.<br/><br/>Nobody could ignore somebody’s favor and the influence that came when he received people’s attention.<br/><br/>‘Well, the political stage might be in preparation. Surely, it will.’<br/><br/>Even in this broken world, isn’t public opinion being formed because of a single functioning community? Public opinion was necessarily connected to politics.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, why don’t you reply? They are strongly demanding in their comments that you respond to Youngdungpo Prosecutor’s request.”<br/><br/>It was hard for Sungwoo to decide. The presence of public opinion also meant that it could be manipulated to some extent. This was confirmed by the surge of the comments by those crazy followers of Youngdungpo Prosecutor in the community called ‘Youngdungpo Believers.’<br/><br/>It seemed that Sugnwoo’s flat ignorance of their demands would bring about a negative response.<br/><br/>‘Okay, I think I have to see him just once because I can also get some hidden information from him.’<br/><br/>For example, because he met soldiers, he could get access to the prophetic stone, and he could respond after seeing the future in advance.<br/><br/>As a result, the most important thing for Sungwoo right now was to attain level 15 to find the exact location of the deadly sickle. If he couldn’t find it before the new year, he would be destined to serve as Lich’s servant.<br/><br/>‘If I see Youngdungpo Prosecutor, I may get new information and raise my level.’<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo, whose ID was kor-157, left a comment on the community bulletin.<br/><br/>─ kor-157: Okay, I’ll wait for you.<br/><br/>˪ Hamin Lee: Oh! Cool! He doesn’t even change his nickname;;<br/><br/>˪ Glasses Warrior: Cool. Cheering for you!<br/><br/>˪ Reporter Joontae Park: Two heroes meet in the current disaster. I expected it, but I was surprised because your meeting came earlier than I expected. It seems that an ordinary citizen like me can’t outwit our heroes. I hope your meeting will be of help to mankind.<br/><br/>˪ Yasuo 1: lol.<br/><br/>˪ Youngdungpo Prosecutor: Thank you. Since I know where you are, I’ll see you shortly.<br/><br/>How could he know Sungwoo’s location without Sungwoo telling him? Youngdungpo Prosecutor might have gathered all kinds of information about Sungwoo through the community, but he didn’t ask Sungwoo about such a sensitive matter even indirectly.<br/><br/>‘This guy openly brags about his ability to collect intelligence. He is full of confidence.’<br/><br/>Obviously, the Youngdungpo Prosecutor didn’t take this issue as a simple business relationship.<br/><br/>Wooooong!<br/><br/>At that moment, Taesung’s motorcycle stopped at the front door with a loud engine sound outside. He hurried into the museum with some of his friends.<br/><br/>Among them was Yujin, the girl who became a vampire. After the death of the Vampire Lord, she gradually diluted her blood, then returned to her original job, “wizard.”<br/><br/>Taesung’s expression looked pretty urgent.<br/><br/>“I was ambushed!”<br/><br/>“Ambushed?” Sungwoo frowned.<br/><br/>“Yeah! Strange guys suddenly attacked us and kidnapped Minjoon!”<br/><br/>Catching his breath, Taesung explained that about ten guys riding motorcycles appeared suddenly and tried to negotiate.<br/><br/>“They suddenly approached us, asking us if we saw something like a golden deer. When we said no, they recklessly attacked us all of a sudden.”<br/><br/>Taesung and his friends chose to run because they were numerically inferior. They barely managed to escape.<br/><br/>“But I think they might come this way soon.”<br/><br/>Since they had taken Minjoon hostage, they would definitely come this way.<br/><br/>“Guide me to the place.”<br/><br/>As the area restrictions were lifted, those who survived in other regions began to come to Sungwoo’s camp, but he didn’t want a group of strangers to approach the village where he was staying now.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>It wasn’t difficult for Sungwoo to spot the biker hooligans. When Sungwoo walked along the south street for a few minutes, he found a group of strangers stopping at the crossroads.<br/><br/>“Oh, you are the same guy who escaped a little while ago, right?” One of them asked.<br/><br/>“Yeah, that’s right. So, did you bring brothers and sisters to confront us?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was there with Jisoo, Hanho, and Taeseong.<br/><br/>It was natural that the hooligans regarded Sungwoo’s party as an easy target.<br/><br/>At a glance, they looked like a biker gang, given that they were wearing leather jackets, goggles and hoods. It seemed they were in their teens like Taeseung.<br/><br/>“Hey, did you come here to welcome us, thinking we were going to find you?”<br/><br/>A guy holding a mace among them stepped forward. He was a muscular man in his 40s, with purple hair that didn’t suit his age.<br/><br/>He glanced at Sungwoo for a moment, then began to examine Jisu.<br/><br/>His gaze was pretty seductive.<br/><br/>“Huh? Pretty sister? Would you like to take a drive with me?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Indeed, the way he spoke to Jisu was typical of a third-rate biker.<br/><br/>It was so disgusting to hear him babbling on.<br/><br/>“Brother, we might lose the golden deer if we don’t take action. Good Heavens! You get carried away by pretty women!”<br/><br/>The muscular man tapped his head for a moment when other gang members shouted at him.<br/><br/>“Damn it, I was distracted for a moment. By the way, did you see the golden deer by any chance?”<br/><br/>“Golden deer?”<br/><br/>“Yes, it’s literally a golden deer. Don’t ever plan to hide it like a woodcutter. Just tell us where it escaped.”<br/><br/>“This is my first time hearing about it. Where are you from?”<br/><br/>Lifting the mace, the guy scratched his head and said, “Oh, you don’t understand me? If you are not the golden deer, I think I have to ask you out, pretty sister?”<br/><br/>Then, the man raised his right hand and wriggled like a pervert.<br/><br/>Watching him, Jisu spoje with a sigh, when Sungwoo was about to respond.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, let me deal with him.”<br/><br/>“Sure.”<br/><br/>When Jisu stepped forward, the man laughed, revealing his gums.<br/><br/>“Oh, what the heck is this? Are you interested in me? Do you like a big man like me?”<br/><br/>But when Jisu pulled out her sword, he frowned violently.<br/><br/>“Shit, don’t you stop? If I crush your head, I can’t take delight in caressing you.”<br/><br/>“Well, you are going to see your hands served first before touching me.”<br/><br/>“You bitch! Don’t move there.”<br/><br/>The guy spat then strode toward her with a mace but she was rotating the sword in her right hand in a circle.<br/><br/>The man swung his mace first. However, Jisu avoided it by twisting smoothly. His mace struck a truck parked right next to her.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>There were sparks shooting out of the truck body.<br/><br/>‘Sparks?’<br/><br/>It was her skill. Anybody who merely touched it would fall from an electric shock.<br/><br/>“Hey, can you be kind enough to get hit just once? Then, I can carry you on my back without any wounds. So, please get hit when I swing the mace softly, will you?”<br/><br/>Booung!<br/><br/>The man struck with the mace again, but she stepped back to avoid the attack and immediately bounced off to the front. Then, she swung her sword so quickly that he couldn’t even respond.<br/><br/>The blade of her sword looked as if it cut through his wrist with sparks flying along the trajectory of the blade.<br/><br/>The next moment the man screamed in pain.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>His wrists were floating in the air. He looked at his severed wrists and collapsed.<br/><br/>Jisu approached him and said, “Poor uncle, sorry. It looks like you are not going to drive again for the rest of your life. You should get on the back of another uncle’s bike.” </div><h2 id="chapter74">Chapter 74</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            When they watched one of his gang members beaten helplessly like that, the gang members began to move. One of them pulled out a long wand and fired something at Jisu.<br/><br/>Poooooh!<br/><br/>It was a circular flame, often called a ‘Fireball’.<br/><br/>However, Jisu swung the sword to blow out the flames. They scattered in the air.<br/><br/>“Attack her!”<br/><br/>Two of them picked up daggers, while the others were about to shoot crossbows at her back.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>Right at that moment, Hanho threw daggers at them quickly, which hit their necks accurately.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Jisu knocked two daggers out of the air. She circled around them once then swung the sword twice. The next moment, an arm of one and a foot of the other were severed.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhh!”<br/><br/>“Uahhhhh!”<br/><br/>As soon as the four of them collapsed, the remaining gang members had to change their fighting tactics.<br/><br/>“Oh, don’t approach! I’m going to cut this guy, son of a bitch!”<br/><br/>“Minjoon!”<br/><br/>Actually one of the gang members put the knife to Minjoon’s neck. Sungwoo and his party had no choice but to stop.<br/><br/>“Damn it! Where did you come from, you wretched thugs?” the guy holding Minjoon shouted.<br/><br/>Obviously, the gang members already lost their will to fight because threatening Minjoon, their hostage, with a knife meant they regarded him as their last means of survival.<br/><br/>Wearing the newly acquired item, “Shadow King’s Robes,” Sungwoo looked around. A freight truck parked on the road, backlit in the sun, was casting a long shadow.<br/><br/>Sungwoo walked into the shadow.<br/><br/>“….Uh?”<br/><br/>As soon as he walked into the long shadow, he disappeared.<br/><br/>“Where did he disappear?”<br/><br/>“What, what the heck? Is he trying to trick us?”<br/><br/>“Watch out!”<br/><br/>They began to look everywhere in confusion. However, they couldn’t find him anywhere.<br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pi! Pik!<br/><br/>At that moment, something flew out from the shadow at random. They were arrows.<br/><br/>Since they didn’t expect such an attack, the gang members collapsed helplessly, and those who escaped death lowered themselves and hid behind the motorcycles.<br/><br/>Fortunately, they forgot to hold Minjoon, who quickly hurried toward Sungwoo’s party.<br/><br/>“Damn it! You lost him!”<br/><br/>“Man, do you think that’s important now?”<br/><br/>In no time Sungwoo, with his dark green robe fluttering, jumped out of the shadow, holding a black sword.<br/><br/>-You earned 8,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s opponent was a player with level 8. Although his level was far from low, he could not deal with Sungwoo’s attack, who bolted out of the shadow suddenly.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhh!”<br/><br/>“Let’s get out of this place! We’ll come back to take revenge!”<br/><br/>The surviving bikers hurriedly got on their motorcycles, but Sungwoo put his sword in the asphalt and lifted the repeating crossbow that he attached to his waist.<br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/>When the arrow hit the rider’s back, the motorcycle, which he just started, lost balance and slipped on the asphalt.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>-You have earned 7,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/>Sungwoo missed the other three. They ran away like crazy toward the south without looking back.<br/><br/>According to Minjoon, the gangsters seemed to have come from Osan City. They were allegedly constantly wandering in search of the ‘golden deer.’<br/><br/>“What the heck is the golden deer?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know what it is, but don’t you think it’s very precious when you hear that word? It looks like you will get lots of gold if you catch it,” said Taesung casually.<br/><br/>In Sungwoo’s mind, the image of gold was clearly linked to money.<br/><br/>That’s why the biker gang, who apparently knew the value of the golden deer, came up to this area to find it.<br/><br/>“Let’s go back.”<br/><br/>After taking the bodies of the bikers and useful things from their motorcycles, Sungwoo and his party moved back to the village.<br/><br/>Then, they saw the “golden deer”, to their surprise.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, look at that in the alley over there.”<br/><br/>Jisu whispered to Sungwoo, who then turned his head. There was the ‘golden deer,’ with a curvy and slender figure shining gold.<br/><br/>[Hidden Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: Catch the golden deer that brings good luck!<br/><br/>-Type: Target acquisition<br/><br/>-Goal: Hunt the golden deer<br/><br/>-Reward: Hidden Stage Admission Ticket (1/2)<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>“Quest?”<br/><br/>The same message appeared to everyone in Sungwoo’s party who saw the golden deer.<br/><br/>At that moment, the golden deer turned and disappeared into the alley.<br/><br/>“We should catch her, right?”<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, it looks like we’d be a fool if we don’t catch her.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately released the beast skeletons.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>The skeletons dispersed in all directions. The golden deer was not an object that humans could catch by running with both feet. They could catch her with an arrow, but Sungwoo thought differently.<br/><br/>The Weretiger skeleton did not move along the two-dimensional path. He immediately climbed the outer wall of the building and disappeared beyond the roof.<br/><br/>“The golden deer went this way!”<br/><br/>They chased the golden deer. Since the skeletons ran ahead of them, they didn’t have to drive her from behind.<br/><br/>The moment they went around the third alley, they saw her golden tail.<br/><br/>The golden deer stopped in the middle of an alley and stared straight ahead. Obviously, the deer was wary and on alert. What she was looking at was not Sungwoo, nor the skeletons.<br/><br/>“Werewolf in front of us!”<br/><br/>A Werewolf was looking toward them with his head lowered.<br/><br/>Sungwoo defeated Werewolves so many times, but he knew he should not let down his guard carelessly because he could be outdone at any moment.<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party felt something strange.<br/><br/>“What the hell is that Werewolf waiting for?”<br/><br/>“Yeah, very weird.”<br/><br/>Originally, a Werewolf is very violent in nature, so he was supposed to rush to his target recklessly, but the Werewolf was not so inclined. He lowered himself, pricked his ears, and watched his surroundings. The golden deer went around in circles, trapped in the middle.<br/><br/>‘Catch her now!’ Sungwoo signaled to the Weretiger.<br/><br/>Sungwoo had no intention of losing the golden deer because of that Werewolf.<br/><br/>As soon as the Weretiger skeleton fell from the roof, he bit the golden deer’s neck. The golden deer drooped at the Weretiger’s attack.<br/><br/>-You have succeeded in the Hidden Quest .<br/><br/>* Reward is given to you. (Hidden Stage Admission Ticket 1/2)<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was gazing at the Werewolf in front of them. He started to step back little by little at the Weretiger’s appearance.<br/><br/>‘What the heck? Should I catch him?’<br/><br/>While Sungwoo was agonizing for a moment, the Werewolf turned his head, climbed the hill beside them, and disappeared.<br/><br/>“That Werewolf was a little weird, right? Have you ever seen a beast man like a Werewolf running away like that? Did anybody beat and release him?”<br/><br/>The Werewolf was definitely strange, but he stopped thinking about it and confirmed the rewards obtained from catching the golden deer. It was a card-sized gold ticket.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Hidden Stage Admission Ticket (1/2)<br/><br/>-Grade: Event<br/><br/>-Category: Other<br/><br/>-Effect: Effective only when you have two cards.<br/><br/>It seemed that it was impossible for Sungwoo to enter the ‘hidden stage’ with just one card.<br/><br/>If so, he had to hunt another golden deer like this.<br/><br/>His phone vibrated, which was a notification of the new comments in the community bulletin.<br/><br/>“Already?”<br/><br/>“Why? What is it?”<br/><br/>“He will arrive soon.”<br/><br/>“Who is it?”<br/><br/>“Who else should come here?”<br/><br/>The Youngdungpo Prosecutor left a comment that he would arrive in five minutes.<br/><br/>How could he arrive at Suwon City from Youngdungpo district so quickly? All the streets were probably blocked by abandoned vehicles, so it was almost impossible for him to arrive so quickly.<br/><br/>But Sungwoo immediately found it out right after he arrived at the village.<br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/>Two firefighter helicopters appeared in the square.<br/><br/>“Is he on the helicopter?”<br/><br/>“Wow, this guy is appearing before us gorgeously!”<br/><br/>The strong winds of the rotor swept the area along with a tremendous noise. The helicopters began to hover, then four ropes lowered to the ground for landing.<br/><br/>Holding the ropes tightly, people wearing heavy armor began to descend at once.<br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/>Given that they were jumping down wearing such heavy armor, they were obviously tough guys.<br/><br/>They dispersed in all directions to secure the helicopter’s landing area and guard the surroundings.<br/><br/>The other helicopter slowly landed in the center of the tight security.<br/><br/>Its rotors slowed down and the engine stopped. Finally, a yellow shield around the helicopter was revealed and slowly began to disappear. Obviously, it was a magic skill.<br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, the thick door opened, and a very tall man got off. He seemed to be in his early 30s.<br/><br/>‘What a tall guy!’<br/><br/>He seemed to be at least 190 cm tall, but he seemed much bigger because he was wearing white full-body armor, commonly referred to as “full-plate armor.” However, because he had a very good proportionate build, he looked like a model rather than just a big man.<br/><br/>On his back was a big sword, about 170 cm tall. However, the sword was so long that it looked like he was carrying a cross.<br/><br/>Twenty members of the guild he organized began to line up behind him. They, too, wore full-plate armor. They looked like medieval European knights.<br/><br/>“It’s nice to meet you. I am the Youngdungpo Prosecutor. Oh, no, my name is Junghoon Choi.”<br/><br/>“Nice to see you. I’m Sungwoo Yu.”<br/><br/>The moment the two shook their hands, one guild member stepped to the side and took out something from his neck.<br/><br/>Click!<br/><br/>Sungwoo made a puzzled expression, but Junghoon, the Youngdungpo Prosecutor, smiled at him casually.<br/><br/>“Because this meeting could be a historical moment.”<br/><br/>Among those struggling to survive among the crowd there suddenly appeared a man who was talking about the future. </div><h2 id="chapter75">Chapter 75</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Youngdungpo Prosecutor, Junghoon Choi…<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This guy is different,’ Sungwoo thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo glanced at him, he immediately felt this guy was unusual.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was not because he had a big build, or because he was handsome, or because he had an item wrapped around his body that Sungwoo felt that way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘There is something more to him.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo led him into the museum. The survivors of the village were gathered in the lobby of the museum because they wanted to see this ‘Youngdungpo Prosecutor’ named who ranked 2 in the community.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow. he is handsome!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He’s really tall. What the heck is that armor and weapon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, Junghoon’s appearance itself was brilliant enough to claim his reputation in the community.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was a tall and handsome man with white full plate armor and an enormous sword. He looked like the common image of a prince riding a white horse.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he was accompanied by a group of majestic knights, the crowd burst out into exclamations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That person really looks extraordinary.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I now know why they call him a hero.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if his arrival were his triumphant procession, the survivors showed admiration for Junghoon, but Sungwoo felt somewhat strange when he saw Junghoo behaving pompously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I felt something unusual about this man, but the survivors are overreacting now.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, it’s not an exact comparison, but the way they looked at him eagerly reminded him of the way the vampires looked at the Vampire Lord.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Does this guy something like a skill?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>A skill that influences people’s emotions? It was possible he had one. Sungwoo felt his possession of such a skill might not be groundless, but there was no way for him to check it right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Maybe I’m too conscious of him now.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suppressing an uncomfortable sentiment, he led Junghoon to the office of the business director.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come this way.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon had his deputies on standby in the hallway. Then just two of them sat face to face on the sofa in the office.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon opened his mouth first, “The people here look stable. You can’t find such expressions easily anymore.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He also showed a relaxed smile while saying so.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although he was famous in the community and responsible for the largest group of survivors to date, he didn’t have an air of arrogance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think it was good I came to see you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? Isn’t the Youngdungpo district much more stable, is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled out two cans of beverages from the small refrigerator.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, haha. Thanks for the soda.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon opened the soda cheerfully. After taking a sip, he looked at Sungwoo again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His smile slowly disappeared from his face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As you may know, the survivors in the Seoul area are gathering around the Youngdungpo area.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>To put it accurately, some groups of survivors were joining those in Youngdungpo with Youngdungpo Prosecutor Junghoon as their leader.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He then invited Sungwoo to join the guild that he organized. One of the reasons he visited here today was to persuade Sungwoo to join the guild.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Though countless people died, the number of people in my place are by no means small as the survivors continue to gather there,” Jungoon said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How many are in your area?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Around 30,000 people flocked to Youngdungpo Station originally. I think there will be over 40,000 soon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>30,000? To be honest, Sungwoo was surprised because there were a little less than 300 survivors in his village.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? That’s a huge number.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, a lot. It’s overcrowded over there…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>For the first time, Jungoon made a gloomy expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo asked, “If there are many survivors, aren’t they helpful to you? I thought that’s why you promoted the Safety Zone and proclaimed a guild.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Prosecutor Yeongdeungpo was the first to post his comments on the community bulletin. Since then he has attracted people by promoting the Safety Zone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s a misunderstanding on your part. Believe it or not, I just wanted to save more lives.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A bitterness was on Junghoon’s face. Did he really save people out of pure goodwill?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“And I would like to say that these 30,000 players are helpful, of course. But out of these 30,000 people, how many of them do you think have adapted to this world?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo seemed to know what he meant. In fact, of the hundreds of players in town, only a few could do their job well enough. They numbered about a quarter at most.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The remaining three-quarters played the role of assistants, or they were being supported by others in the group.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If they numbered 30,000, the size of the population that needed to be supported was different.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just because they have survived doesn’t mean that all of them have adapted to the new world because the person who succeeded in adapting might have saved several others around him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“In that sense, we need more elites like you Sungwoo to save many more… I have been watching you for a long time because you were mentioned often in the community. However, you were not on the priority list of people for my guild recruitment.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You have changed your mind because of the players’ ranking, right?” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, he contacted Sungwoo through the community bulletin right after the ranking of players was released.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes. The ranking proves that you haven’t been talked about a lot because you’re lucky.”Junghoon said, lowering his head while fiddling with the soda can. He continued, “Sungwoo, there are many strong colleagues around me. But I don’t have one who I can trust, or who can take initiative. Most of them brought their own groups to entrust their safety with me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Actually, I am anxious. It hasn’t been a while since the world has changed like this, but these survivors look up at me as if I’m a hero, and there are so many people who want to rely on me…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon then raised his head and looked at him, “I don’t think I’m such a strong guy. Haha…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was trying to mock himself when he came here to persuade Sungwoo to join his guild.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo asked, “Why are you saying that? I don’t think you can say something like that to someone like me you’ve just seen for the first time.” Sungwoo subtly rebuked him,<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon raised his head again and said, “You’re right. Yes. To put it bluntly, I’m now appealing to your emotions.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Appealing to me?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Because you are not likely to join my guild based on my level or forces. My impression of you is that you seem to be reluctant to get stuck to anybody. It seems you are straightforward and individualistic.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungoo was not sure what part of him made Junghoon feel like that, but he was definitely individualistic. So, he didn’t confirm or deny what Junghoon pointed out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, let me appeal to your emotions a little more. I lost my family a few days ago. Then, when I pulled myself together, I got even upset beyond my doubts about this game.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His eyes became even sharper.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Even though I’m simply following the game rules now, I want to change them in the future. I want to break the rules. I’d like to figure out why this is happening, and get even with them if I can.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s why I need someone I can trust. I need someone who is as strong as me, and who can look critically at my opinion instead of those who try to rely on me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo made eye contact with Junghoon, then asked, “Do you think I am such a person?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Actually, I don’t know yet whether you are such a person. All I can know is your level.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon was very straightforward.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s why I’ve come to see what kind of person you are.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He stared at Sungwoo sharply.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nodding at him, Sungwoo leaned on the sofa and said, “So, what you want to say is you want me to join your guild, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, that’s correct. But if that was the only reason, I wouldn’t have come here in a hurry like this.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a serious expression, he pulled something out of his little pocket. It was a red stone with a faint glow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately realized what it was. ‘It is Prophecy Stone.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He frowned his eyebrows unwittingly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is a prophecy stone… Do you really know what this is?” he asked, checking even Sungwoo’s slightest change in expression. Sungwoo’s expression, which was something like a suspicious glance, seemed to have stiffened at that moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had the “Prophecy Stone (Season 2”) he obtained from soldiers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Is it right for me to share that information with him? No, I don’t have to. Let me be prudent.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo shook his head, then said, “No, I haven’t seen it before. It’s very unusual.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Junghoon’s eyes were still discerning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He nodded slowly and said, “Well, yes, it’s unusual. That’s why I am getting impatient. Now, put your hand on it and touch it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo slowly reached out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have touched ‘Prophecy Stone (Korean Server Bad Ending 2)’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just like the Prophecy Stone he had seen before, a video began to play before his eyes. </div><h2 id="chapter76">Chapter 76</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Gu Gu Gu ….<br/><br/><br/><br/>The video was showing an overview of Yeouido in the center of Seoul.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Among the forests of buildings in Yeouido there arose a huge tree, taller than the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The branches of the giant tree were high and wide enough to wander through the clouds. It was so wide that it almost covered the entire island like a ceiling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Is this a world tree?’ Sungwoo wondered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Buildings around the tree began to shake. Their vibrations swirled the Han River and destroyed the downtown area north of the Han River because of the roots of the tree. The roots shook the ground when they extended below the surface of the earth in all directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kugguguuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The roots began to break through the ground, forming a wide field of vines around the tree. It looked like a pile of hair.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That wasn’t the end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh no!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>An enormous number of stems extending from the roots grabbed and trapped people everywhere. Then, they rammed the stems into every hole of their bodies and sucked their body fluids.<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>The destruction was not confined to the Yeouido area. The world tree grew bigger and bigger and its roots covered the entire Korean Peninsula.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The video playing before Sungwoo’s eyes ended.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-This is the future that you will see when you can’t stop ‘the fallen.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>* The fallen will plant the seeds of the “world tree” in certain areas and change the nature of the world tree through human sacrifices.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The Fallen?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo has never heard of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did you see the video to the end?” Junghoon asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, we need to join hands to stop the arrival of this kind of world. That’s why I appeal to your emotions and reach out before I could find out who you are.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon spoke in an even more determined voice.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>“That means you are now trying to assemble a team including me to attack it, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, we need power, and a lot of power at that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What he said was literally a boss raid.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded and said, “I agree we have to join hands.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had to admit it. Even if he could block the Lich of “Season 2”, it would bring about a total destruction if he neglected the world tree. He could not leave this job to someone else.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. I’m very relieved you said that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon stood from his seat. This tall guy with an overwhelming build looked down at Sungwoo and said, “Sungwoo, this is what I think. In a situation where we don’t have any government, no one should be held responsible for this situation. It’s best for you and me to survive, after all.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, those who have a sense of responsibility should come out voluntarily. Responsibility is… doing something that no one wants to do.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He held out his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As for this work, no one wants to do it. But I will. Will you join me, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at his hand. He couldn’t take it carelessly. So, he decided to give it some more thought .<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, there is one thing I want to make sure of.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please go ahead,” he said, withdrawing his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I am not going to join your guild.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Junghoon remained calm when Sungwoo declined his offer to join the guild.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo continued, “I can temporarily cooperate with you. As for the raid on the boss, okay, let’s fight together. But you have to distribute the results of the raid to me fairly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What Sungwoo emphasized was this, namely fair distribution.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This guy only talked about the great cause of the fight, but he didn’t mention anything about the distribution.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought that’s the most important thing in any contract. He might look like a snob, but he had to secure it in order to survive within the rules of this game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If it’s not fair, I can’t fight for my life.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon nodded. He sat down on the couch again. Then, he slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, let’s do it this way. Based on the number of groups participating in the raid, let’s distribute the results at a reasonable proportion. Let me post a message about my promise on the community bulletin.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s eyebrows twitched at his new offer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Community? Nope, this is dangerous.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The community was Junghoon’s jurisdiction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, besides, please add the clause that all the conditions you offered to me now were suggested by the Liberation Guild, so that the groups participating in the raid can’t blame me just in case.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The community itself could be a contract, but Sungwoo wanted to block the heated pros and cons or manipulation of opinion on the community bulletin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay, that sounds good.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon reached out and Sungwoo held his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, three days from now–”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment there rang a siren.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Siren noises?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a loudspeaker held by the guards on the roof. In other words, it was a siren that there was a raid.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Honk! Honk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then loud honking rang outside the window.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The raid operation will begin in three days. What’s going on out?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo approached the window and raised the blinds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woooong! Honking!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of motorbikes surrounded the museum on rolling wheels and honking, making a big fuss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were the remnants of the gang of bikers who came up from Osan, who Sungwoo and his party lost the other day.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It seems like they have brought me an item through quick service. Of course, I haven’t ordered it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It looks like we have met the first opponent of our alliance.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo! They’re outside…” Hanho shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I know. I saw them, too.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo went out the door. When Junghoon followed him, the group of knights on standby in the hallway turned to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The Crusader Team!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes! We’re ready anytime.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They then began to follow Junghoon as the rattling sound filled the hallway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, if I may ask you, is your job a necromancer? I heard you control the undead. I think it will be helpful for us to know each other’s jobs before the battle.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, you’re right.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“My job is a ‘Crusader Commander.’ By appointing crusaders, I can organize a group of knights and get even greater synergy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately realized that at first glance, Junghoon’s occupation was a five-star job. The two did not mention what they drew as the linkage card.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two walked side by side and went out of the museum. Then, four motorcycles approached them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Brother! That son of a bitch beat us!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the bikers who Sungwoo lost at the crossroad pointed at him. Then, the man in sunglasses, who seemed to be the leader of the gang, got off his motorcycle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He slightly lowered his sunglasses with his index finger and alternately looked at Sungwoo and Junghoon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, that guy in that green cloak over there? Not the man in armor next to him?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes. That man in the cloak.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The gang leader could ignore Sungwoo, but he must have noticed that Junghoon was wearing full plate armor with a very high level. However, the leader did not show any signs of getting cold feet. Did he have anybody to support him?<br/><br/><br/><br/>He came up to Sungwoo and said, “I’m sorry for making a fuss like this. But my men here who went on a business trip said some of my brothers were beaten to death in a remote place, so as their big brother, I could not help but come here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, he pulled out a chained mace from the rear seat of his motorcycle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Booung! Booung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>He began to turn it in a threatening manner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, my beloved golden deer ran out of my house. Have you seen her? If you like to beat around the bush, I’ll beat you up terribly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, 40 bikers aimed at him with bows and crossbows from all sides. Some of them were wizards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Junghoo came up and said, “Sungwoo, I’m really sorry for coming here and asking for your help. Can we deal with them to pay back my debt?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Of course.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was also curious about how strong Youngdungpo Prosecutor Junghoo’s Crusader Team was.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon pulled out a long sword from his back. Then, a team of 20 Crusaders lined up on either side. Their movement itself was very threatening.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the bikers began to fire the arrows urgently. However, the next moment after Junghoon lifted the sword vertically, a golden shield was created around him and the Crusader Team.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tu-tu-tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusader Team bounced forward all at once and blocked all the incoming arrows with their bodies. Arrows fell down under their feet helplessly, and the magic evaporated from the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then Junghoon pointed the sword forward. However, the sword looked a bit unique.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Crossbow?’ </div><h2 id="chapter77">Chapter 77</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            The hilt was slightly curved and looked like the handle of a rifle, and the wide crossguard was equipped with a bow. It was literally a huge sword and crossbow.<br/><br/>Junghoon loaded an arrow and pointed the blade to the front.<br/><br/>Tu-woong!<br/><br/>When he drew the bow, a ray of light spread through the groove of its blade. It was not a real arrow, but a magic arrow. However, its physical destructive power was enormous.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>After piercing through the two members of the gang and a motorcycle, it broke down the outer wall of the building behind his back.<br/><br/>“What the heck was that?”<br/><br/>“Something just passed us…”<br/><br/>While the biker gang members were embarrassed, the Crusaders Team lowered the blades of the swords they erected and ran forward.<br/><br/>“Charge!”<br/><br/>“Cut them all!”<br/><br/>The knights in heavy armor charged toward them all at once. They struck the motorcycles with their bodies and wielded their long swords violently.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Although these gang members were quite notorious in the Osan area, they were no match for the “Crusader Team,” the central axis of the first guild in South Korea.<br/><br/>Their motorcycles were cut entirely with their riders, and blood was gushing from their limbs here and there.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>“Damn it! I can’t attack them!”<br/><br/>The bikers, mostly armed with long-range weapons, were very vulnerable in close combat. Moreover, the shields around the Crusader team’s bodies repelled almost all the attacks.<br/><br/>The biker gang members who were holding their heads high collapsed in a few seconds. It looked as if a herd of zebras was confronting a herd of buffalos.<br/><br/>‘Awesome. I can feel that they are wrapping their bodies with high-quality synergy.’<br/><br/>Obviously Jung-hoon, the Crusader Commander who could appoint a Crusader, had a job optimized for team play and synergy. Of course, Sungwoo also had the same optimized job in a different sense.<br/><br/>It seemed that the biker gang would perish once and for all this time. Camera shutters popped up behind his back.<br/><br/>Click! Click!<br/><br/>A guild member with a camera on his neck stepped back and clicked the shutter of a camera.<br/><br/>At that moment, there was a loud explosion.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>With two explosions, black liquid splashed in all directions. Then, black smoke went up. Some of the Crusader Team fell down to the floor.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuh! Argh!”<br/><br/>“What the heck is that smoke! Don’t breathe in that smoke!”<br/><br/>The Crusaders who inhaled the unidentified smoke began to stumble. The protective shields wrapped around their bodies flickered.<br/><br/>“Commander! It’s magic we have never seen before! Avoid it!”<br/><br/>Camera flash stopped popping up.<br/><br/>“I thought it was a great shield! But it was shallow. Hey, let me deal with you! Come on!”<br/><br/>The biker gang leader shouted, hiding behind an abandoned truck.<br/><br/>He was hiding there to avoid Junghoon’s crossbow attack, but he was holding something in both hands.<br/><br/>‘That’s the Abyss Concentrate Capsule!’ Sungwoo muttered.<br/><br/>It was that very unknown bomb manufactured by the door-to-door vendors that the regiment commander had threatened to explode in front of Sungwoo recently.<br/><br/>Even Sungwoo hadn’t seen its power yet, but he confirmed that it was a horrible weapon that could destroy everything at once. The Crusader Team members could barely withstand the bomb, but other players would have been killed on the spot.<br/><br/>“What the hell…”<br/><br/>The Crusader Team retreated, staggering, and Junghoon looked clearly embarrassed.<br/><br/>“Junghoon, I saw you guys fighting well. Nice job!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo, who was standing behind him, passed him and stepped forward.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo. What are you doing?”<br/><br/>“I think I can show you something.”<br/><br/>The deadly poison did not work on Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Uh? Is he crazy? Didn’t you see this? Hey?”<br/><br/>The gang leader shouted loudly at Sungwoo. But Sungwoo didn’t stop moving toward him.<br/><br/>The gang leader eventually threw the “Abyss Concentrate Capsule” in his right hand.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The terrible bomb exploded right in front of Sungwoo, whose body was immediately swallowed up in black smoke.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>A moment of silence ensued. Only the sound of the wind passed over the road.<br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo appeared amid the dark smoke that was gradually fading.<br/><br/>“Oh, my God.”<br/><br/>“How could he survive when he was attacked by the deadly bomb?”<br/><br/>But Sungwoo began to walk out without any wounds. He was smiling.<br/><br/>“Yeah, this was what I had expected. Abyss.”<br/><br/>A gust of wind arose, then black smoke scattered into the air. Then, as if the curtain was peeling off, white demons, who suddenly appeared all of a sudden, were standing tall behind him.<br/><br/>Monsters of overwhelming size, covered with bone armor, lined up behind him, whose splendour was quite different from that of the Crusader Team a little while ago.<br/><br/>Their presence was so overwhelming that even the Crusader Team had no choice but to admire their fantastic might.<br/><br/>“That’s what they call…” Junghoon muttered.<br/><br/>This time the Necromancer, a monster-like hero that Junghoon heard about through the grapevines, stepped forward.<br/><br/>‘Yeah, he is definitely different!’<br/><br/>Junghoon felt it the first time he encountered Sungwoo because there was no change in his expression even when Sungwoo saw his passive skill, “Aura of War Hero.”<br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/>-Name: Aura of War Hero<br/><br/>-Grade: Skilled<br/><br/>-Category: Passive<br/><br/>-Consumption: None<br/><br/>*When you are ‘fully armed’, the aura wrapped around your body will deceive those around you, so you can have them like and respect you. The lower the opponent’s level, the greater the influence of the skill. (Appropriate target: less than Level 10). Also, the more the opponent’s psychology is in ‘anxiety’ status, the more the opponent can be affected by the skill, regardless of his level.<br/><br/>‘Sungwoo is not much affected by this skill simply because of his high level, but this guy is very prudent.’<br/><br/>Since Sungwoo’s level was 10 or higher, it was clear that he was less affected by the skill. However, given that he wasn’t intimated at all, he was psychologically stable.<br/><br/>At first glance, psychological stability was nothing special, but in this hellish world, his psychological stability was great in that he could calmly watch Junghoon and his men appearing in a helicopter.<br/><br/>‘Yeah, I now know his calmness comes from his confidence…’<br/><br/>Watching the skeleton army appearing in the black smoke, Junghoon nodded.<br/><br/>‘I have to bring him into our guild by all means.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo truly met Junghoon’s expectations.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Human skeletons of enormous size scattered in all directions, starting to slaughter the terrified prey like a trained hound.<br/><br/>“Argh! Go away!”<br/><br/>“Turn on the engine! Hurry up! Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>Their morale was already broken when they were outpowered by the Crusader Team. Now, faced with the attack of the monster skeletons, they could not fight.<br/><br/>Unlike the Crusaders, who attacked relatively predictably, the skeletons charged at them violently like ferocious beasts.<br/><br/>Kwaduk! Kwaduk!<br/><br/>They were ripped apart by the skeletons’ toenails and cut by their teeth.<br/><br/>Blood gushed, and their torn flesh scattered in all directions.<br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/>Sungwoo stood behind them and fired a repeating crossbow. It wasn’t comparable to the powerful shot of the long sword crossbow that Junghoon used, but he could easily suppress them by firing the arrows in quick succession. It was really the best attack in terms of the rear support.<br/><br/>“Get on quickly!”<br/><br/>Wuuuung!<br/><br/>The remnants of the biker gang eventually chose to escape. A motorcycle with two on it started to drive down the street, but Sungwoo aimed at their back with the crossbow.<br/><br/>Pik! Pik!<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>The man on the back of the motorcycle drooped, hit by the arrow. However, the motorcycle quickly moved out of range.<br/><br/>Sungwoo put down the crossbow.<br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo shouted, the motorcycle was smashed, its debris scattering in all directions. Sungwoo triggered a Corpse Explosion on the dead man on the back of the motorcycle.<br/><br/>“Well, I felt a little uncomfortable about applying magic on a human body…”<br/><br/>It was difficult to try something for the first time, but after that, you get used to it.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>Explosions broke out everywhere, and the motorcycles went out of balance and collapsed.<br/><br/>The skeletons blocked and cordoned off the roads on both sides, so the bikers could not escape.<br/><br/>It was when the biker remnants were suppressed when somebody shouted.<br/><br/>“Don’t move!”<br/><br/>Suddenly, five bikers were taking a group of women as hostage, aiming their arrows and crossbows at them. They were the cooks from the meat demolition workshop outside of the village.<br/><br/>“Uh? Mom!” Hanho shouted.<br/><br/>Hanho’s mother, Eunhee, was among them. At the time of the bikers’ attack, she was hiding in the corner because she could not escape into the building, but in the end she was caught by them.<br/><br/>“These guys are at the hostage game again?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo sighed as if he was sick and tired of the gangsters’ typical tactics. The current situation was serious. As it turned out, they were holding the women hostages in the area where the rooftop security guards could not see clearly. If Jisu was among the hostages, she might be able to solve the situation. </div><h2 id="chapter78">Chapter 78</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Junghoon said, “Sungwoo, I can cast a long-range protective shield on one of the hostages. If the timing is right, I think we can suppress the bikers without sacrifice.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, he was agonizing over it with a serious expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo shook his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There is a safer way than attacking them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wait a minute.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Jisu among the women hostages was already looking for the right time to attack. She kept rolling her eyes. The moment she noticed something, she pulled her left foot back and withdrew the sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Boowoong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A man’s wrist was severed in an instant. That wasn’t the end. There was a blinding flash and the neck of the man located 3 meters from her was slit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon the wound opened and blood gushed from it. She used a new skill she had learned a while ago called ‘cutting attack.’ It was a sword skill that she could use by consuming mana.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu twisted her body then swung her sword to the other side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Boowoong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, there was a blinding flash again. The two bows were cut in an instant with the arrows spinning in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment the gangsters, embarrassed, were trying to pull the daggers from their waists, Jisu moved quickly from side to side and swung her sword twice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The blade of her sword cut through their necks, but the last guy raised his crossbow and aimed at her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You wretched bitch! Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the next moment, he fell down because Hanho put a dagger in the back of his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The remaining gangsters were ended like that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Click! Click!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the shutter sound, which had been silent for a while, came back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You guys are much better than I thought. So awesome!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon muttered like that, looking at Sungwoo and his party. He was serious. And his gaze was fixed on Jisu, the female warrior wearing a red sweatshirt.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That woman is incredibly sharp, fast and accurate. And your colleagues are also awesome….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he said that, Sungwoo was not beside him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Where are you, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was seen already searching the corpse of the biker gang leader.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ve found it…” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then he found a golden ticket in his inner pocket. It was a ‘Hidden Stage Admission Ticket’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The gangsters went as far as Suwon, chasing the “golden deer.” Of course, it may be because the quest was triggered as soon as they saw the deer, but Sungwoo thought they were desperately chasing the deer because they had already obtained one ticket.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s reasonable suspicion was correct because the gang leader had one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Hidden Stage Admission Ticket (2/2)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Rating: Event<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Other<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: You must have two cards to enjoy the effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Sungwoo collected both tickets.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon approached him and showed interest. Although he was the founder of the first Korean server guild and No. 2 in the players’ ranking, he couldn’t know everything.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He wasn’t aware of the unidentified bomb that almost destroyed his Crusader Team a little while ago, and the flashing ticket held by Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I don’t know either what this is…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Hidden Stage’ is automatically created. Get ready to enter! (Limited to only one owner)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Entrance?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was an unexpected phenomenon. Sungwoo felt a brilliant light flashing behind him. The next moment, an unknown portal swallowed his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Where are you, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon reached out into the portal where his body was being sucked into, but he was pushed back by a certain force.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You do not have permission to enter the portal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon withdrew his hand and stood blankly in the place where Sungwoo disappeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon stared into the air then slowly frowned. He was feeling somewhat unpleasant without any reason.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Authority? What was he holding? Where did he disappear? Golden portal?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He couldn’t figure out why he felt bad. Suddenly, a cheap light colored his face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Click!<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was a cameraman. Junghoon looked back at him and said, “Don’t take a picture of me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was very embarrassed by Junhoon’s expressionless face, which he had never seen before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You can take it when I tell you to do so.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, got it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thanks for your hard work all the time. The pictures you are taking will be a hope for people in the collapsed world. Photos are different from articles in print.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was again smiling at him brightly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes! I will take the pictures with a sense of mission!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Jisu came to Junghoon’s side. She, too, was looking at the place where Sungwoo disappeared because she also never expected it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, do you know where Mr. Sungwoo disappeared?”Junghoon asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She nodded slowly, “I think I know.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Where is he now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She looked up at him and made him nervous a bit. She seemed to agonize about if it was okay to tell him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You can tell me, of course.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I don’t know if it’s okay because I haven’t heard what you talked about with him.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon could feel that she totally trusted Sungwoo, but she had some doubt about himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I and Sungwoo decided to join hands.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She was still wary of him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But he nodded as if he understood her feelings, and said, “That’s why the current situation is very embarrassing for me. I just wonder what happened to him, but I can’t judge how I should respond right now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he mentioned Sungwoo’s safety, there was a change in her expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He continued, “Think about it carefully. We don’t know if he is in danger. We can’t just wait like a puppet here for him to come back, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon spoke as if he was sincerely worried, and Jisu blushed, listening to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Puppet…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>She felt hurt to hear that word. She initially decided to help Sungwoo for survival on the campus and came as far as here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But at some point she became dependent on Sungwoo’s judgment. Like a puppet, as Junghoon just said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And for some reason, she felt Junghoon was sincere now because she didn’t know she was being influenced by his skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After agonizing a bit, she nodded. She thought it was true that for whatever reason Sungwoo decided to cooperate with Junghoon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo first met the soldiers, he temporarily cooperated with them, and his decision paid off for him and his party at the end of the day. Sungwoo would not unconditionally reject anybody who was stronger than him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know anything except that he went to the place called ‘Hidden Stage’.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hidden Stage? Well, I can’t figure out what it is.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon thought hard about it again, but there was nothing he could figure out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t have any other information. I didn’t expect this would happen to him. Like you said, I just trust Sungwoo,” Jisu added.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you for telling me that. Like you said, I think he’s a reliable man.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After she was done talking, Jisu turned right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, can I ask your name?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“My name is Jisu Yun.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, you were really awesome a little while ago. During that short span you fought them calmly and accurately…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He stopped praising her after noticing her cold expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He cleared his throat and said, “So, if you don’t mind, can I talk with you until Sungwoo comes back? I would like to speak with you about my guild.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, he openly tried to scout her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I hate that,” she openly rejected his offer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He stared blankly as she walked away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then he muttered to himself, scratching his cheek.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, it’s not easy to scout the people here. Hahaha.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t Sungwoo’s first experience getting sucked into a portal. In the past, he had the experience of being sucked into the basement of a building by stepping on a trap after entering the ‘Supermart Dungeon.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time again he fell from the air. After landing on the floor, he stood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have entered the ‘Golden Valley’ of the Hidden Stage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Information about Hidden Stage]<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) A special reward is given upon clearing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) In case of failure, you will be automatically expelled to the original location.<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Upon death, your body is automatically expelled to its original position.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Defeat the stage boss in 30 minutes!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this? Is it really like a bonus stage?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, how can this be called a valley?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was an old alley that didn’t match the name of a valley at all. It was a very old one that could hardly be found these days with a gray brick wall to the left and a red brick wall to the right.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the front was a utility pole with lots of leaflets and a pile of garbage piled up under it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kekeke!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something crawled out behind it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Goblin?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was the first time he’d encountered a goblin after a very long time, but it was golden.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kekeke! Keke!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was not just one. Goblins, dyed gold, crawled out one by one at the entrance of the alley, totalling five.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Orun!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Go and show them that they can look great even when their skin is peeled off.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Orun stepped forward, thinking, ‘What would he give to me as a reward for catching the golden goblins?’ </div><h2 id="chapter79">Chapter 79</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>When Sungwoo thought about it, there was nothing better than a desk in beating a goblin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he lifted a heavy desk and swung down, he felt it was as hilarious as whacking a mole.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What the hell am I thinking about now?’ he muttered to himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Orun withdrew his Japanese sword. The bodies of the golden goblins were piled up under the utility pole.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This guy’s stronger than normal goblins, but they are not difficult to deal with at all.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Would this goblin be the head goblin? Whatever it was, it was clear that the goblin was no match for Sungwoo. And it wasn’t gold that he could obtain by hunting the golden goblin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have obtained 1 point by hunting the golden goblin. (Cumulative: 5)<br/><br/><br/><br/>He obtained a ‘point’ of unknown purpose. Sungwoo guessed it might be something that he could only use in this dungeon. And soon an information message appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-When clearing the dungeon, you can select items according to the accumulated points.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s like a balloon-popping game.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a game in which the product was changed according to the score one obtained in one game. Then, the way to benefit from this game was simple.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The more I smash, the better.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, Sungwoo heard a very good noise. Goblins opened the old green door in the alley and poured out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately fired a repeating crossbow. Because the alley was very narrow, the golden goblins collapsed helplessly without escaping.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kieh! Kieeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time the blue gate on the other side opened up, and a huge number of goblins came out in droves. Several of them climbed the brick wall and jumped down into the alley.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This dungeon seemed to house lots of goblins to protect itself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If that’s the case, you’re mistaken. Explode!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Golden debris bounced back and forth, and the goblins climbing the gate were thrust away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was natural that both brick walls collapsed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have accumulated 1 point by hunting a golden goblin. (Cumulative: 32)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have accumulated 1 point by hunting a golden goblin. (Cumulative: 33)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have accumulated 1 point by hunting a golden goblin. (Cumulative: 34)<br/><br/><br/><br/>During that short moment, Sungwoo beat 34 goblins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kiehhhhhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>But that wasn’t the end. The door of the detached house inside the collapsed wall opened and more golden goblins appeared. Furthermore, the goblin ripped off the old metal screen and threw himself into the yard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It looks like this house is their hideout.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kiehhhhhhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo pushed two Werebear skeletons forward. Those two alone filled the alley.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the golden goblins didn’t get scared even when they saw the overwhelming size of the Werebear skeletons and rushed forward like fanatics. These guys were different from goblins in the real world. They just looked lifeless, just like monsters in the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Werebear skeletons trampled and killed golden goblins. Although they attacked the skeletons’ knees with daggers, they didn’t inflict any damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Throw them inside!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At his order the skeletons picked up the bodies of the goblins and threw them into the houses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cling!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The corpses of the goblins broke through the windows of the house. It wasn’t just one. They threw a dozen corpses into each house.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Was the inside of the house the goblin’s hideout? However, Sungwoo didn’t have to enter it because he could destroy them all at once if they were holed up inside.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Kugugugu….<br/><br/><br/><br/>The goblins screamed endlessly inside the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have accumulated 1 point by hunting a golden goblin. (Cumulative: 82)<br/><br/><br/><br/>– You have accumulated 1 point by hunting a golden goblin. (Cumulative: 83)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo raised the arm of the Weretiger skeleton to defend against the debris falling from the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have successfully cleared the first stage! (Rank: A+)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have accumulated 100 points. (Cumulative: 184)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, an arrow icon appeared on the floor of the alley. It seemed to be a sign that Sungwoo should move on to the next stage. So, he advanced toward the inside of the alley according to the sign.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The alley grew wider, and soon an empty lot appeared between the houses and a local supermarket. As if it had been neglected for a long time, weeds were abundant, and there was a small pepper field on one side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were dozens of Golden Orcs with their chests bare. Gathered around the vacant lot, they were eating from iron bars and lifting weights, and some of them were wrestling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Also, in the corner of the vacant lot was a truck serving as a table with its cargo compartment open. On top of it were burners, soju bottles, and soda cans.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were even grilled dogs and cats and hamsters stuck on iron bars like grilled skewers. Given that they had leashes around their necks, it was easy to find out where the goblins caught them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuh! Kuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Golden Orcs, who were absorbed in various workouts, were boasting their shiny builds, soaked with sweat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt disgusted to see them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But one of them noticed Sungwoo and shouted. Other Orcs stopped exercising and began to gather and approach him. It was pretty threatening for these Orcs with strong builds to approach him in droves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Strangely enough, they were dispersing to the surroundings of the lot, while emptying the center of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The Golden Orcs have proposed a ‘Glorious Duel’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) The duel is played one-on-one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Mercenaries and subordinate spirits cannot participate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Only one weapon can be used.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Duel all of a sudden? I’ve not agreed!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that Sungwoo had no say in this duel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Orcs began to cheer artificially in wild excitement like the crowds in a fighting game background.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, an Orc from the back of the Orcs and sitting on a huge waste tire, slowly raised his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gruuuuuuu…<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was much bigger than other Orcs, almost 2 meters and 60 cm tall, and the muscles of its back were so developed that its neck could hardly be seen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Champion “Billy the Gold Hand” has appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Billy now approached Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Do I have to fight that monster? Man, he’s got those baby ears…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With his neck hardly seen and baby ears, Billy was often regarded as a monster that nobody should deal with.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although Sungwoo was No. 3 in the Korean server rankings, he didn’t have a job specialized in direct combat. Not only were his stats low, but most of his skills were focused on controlling his subordinate spirits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Decide which weapon you will use in the duel. (15 seconds remaining.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Weapon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had two useful weapons at the moment. One was the “Ownerless Sword,” and the oher was the “Repeating Crossbow.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He slightly turned his head and checked Billy’s weapon. Billy picked up an ax and a dumbbell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Dang it. This guy picked the shields!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was put on the spot. He could not maximize the use of the repeating crossbow when Billy had shield weapons like that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Decide which weapon you will use in the duel. (8 seconds left.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo reluctantly decided on one of the two weapons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The Glorious Duel begins. Fight until one side dies!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as the duel began, Billy rushed at him with a great roar. The Golden Orcs filling the stands around them screamed with excitement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a smile, Billy jumped straight toward Sungwoo. He raised the shield with his left hand while raising his right hand above his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the other hand, Sungwoo was only holding a small ball in his right hand. The next moment, Sungwoo threw the ball under Billy’s feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, this small thing is also a weapon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kwaaaaaang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The weapon that Sungwoo chose was the “Abyssal Concentrate Capsule” he obtained from the regiment commander’s cabinet. Black smoke popped out from the inside of the small ball and quickly swallowed Billy’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, Billy screamed, running out of the black smoke. He threw both his ax and shield and rubbed his face, dry-heaving.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo walked slowly towards Billy. Then he picked up the round shield Billy lost.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, that’s why the choice of weapon is important.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo mumbled then began to strike the giant monster’s head with the round shield, who was shuddering on the floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have won!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Billy’s body dropped.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have accumulated 50 points by defeating Champion Billy. (Cumulative: 234)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game ended before the Orcs got excited enough.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Golden Orcs raised their hands in the air and stopped with their mouths wide open.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a scene that they had never expected or understood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that they thought something was wrong. They shouted and screamed in anger here and there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, like the backup of a martial arts fight jumped on the ring after the game was over, the enraged Golden Orcs began to rush toward Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this? Did they plan it like this from the beginning?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the lineup of Sungwoo’s backup also moved. So the fighting between Sungwoo and the Golden Orcs began in the empty lot. </div><h2 id="chapter80">Chapter 80</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sungwoo slowly slipped back and lifted the repeating crossbow and fired at the bare-chested orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have accumulated 2 points by hunting a Golden Orc. (Cumulative: 252)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have accumulated 2 points by hunting a Golden Orc. (Cumulative: 254)<br/><br/><br/><br/>A little later the stadium was calm and quiet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have successfully cleared the second stage! (Rank: A+)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have accumulated 200 points. (Cumulative: 488)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Again, an arrow icon appeared on the floor. This time there appeared a slightly wider road that would allow a car to pass.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two-story detached houses were lined up on both streets. When Sungwoo went along the road, an arrow was pointing to two places.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A red arrow was pointing to the right and a blue arrow to the left. It was literally a crossroads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do I have to go to only one place?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo raised his head and looked at the end of the arrow. The red arrow was pointing to a small elementary school, and the blue arrow was pointing to a building that looked like an abandoned house.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-R: Very difficult<br/><br/><br/><br/>-L: Very easy<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the difference in the level of difficulty was extreme.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After agonizing a bit, Sungwoo moved to the right.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Being difficult means a big reward.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He could not skip the very rare opportunity called the ‘Hidden Stage.’ It was worth the challenge even at the risk of his life. He had to reach Level 15 as soon as possible, and the boss raid was just around the corner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, just because he wanted to protect himself right now, it didn’t mean his chances of survival would increase. Rather, it would only increase the likelihood of him not avoiding the death to come.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo entered the two-story elementary school building, whose level of difficulty was very high. In the small lobby where the history of the school was displayed, he noticed the traces of the children hastily evacuating. Their slippers and school bags were strewn everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kureuk― Kureuk―<br/><br/><br/><br/>On one side of the stairs was the body of a Golden Orc. And there was something familiar on top of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is it Slime?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A lump of golden liquid. It was definitely golden Slime. Sungwoo burst into laughter before he knew it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, I think I’ve chosen the right way.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Slime was a very easy game for Sungwoo and skeletons because Slime’s acidity couldn’t melt the bones of skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that Sungwoo would be recorded as the worst guest who had ever visited the Hidden Stage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He went straight toward the end of the Hidden Stage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, after Sungwoo disappeared into the golden portal, Junghoon boarded the helicopter and looked only in that direction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was embarrassed at the moment because Sungwoo disappeared when he was not done talking. On the one hand, the place called ‘Hidden Stage’ bothered him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What kind of place is that? Is it a place that offers a huge reward?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon has never heard of any information about the Hidden Stage from anybody else. Such information was not even posted on the community bulletin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, not all of the information was released because the game just started.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a Crusader in gray armor approached Junghoon. He was a man in his thirties wearing glasses attached to his face with a skein of thread.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, lieutenant.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His name was Minhum Jung. He was Junghoon’s aide-de-camp and the Crusader Team’s deputy commander. He had been with Junghoon from the beginning and had been playing a pivotal role in the guild with his experiences as a smart analyst.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“All of the injured members have been recovered. They couldn’t be cured with regular potions, so I used an antidote.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it. It looked like a curse series. What kind of item do you think it is?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum sighed at his question, which suggested it was something negative.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum recorded and sorted all the items that he obtained from the store, but he had never seen the bomb emitting black smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I honestly don’t know. Breath of the abyss? It looks like a black wizard series, but I’ve never seen an item that spread such a powerful curse even at the best shop. I think it’s an item we might be able to obtain from a store that is much superior to the existing one or some other routes.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon’s group, starting from south of the Han River, had become the largest among the entire Korean servers. This meant they had a large amount of intelligence about everything, but they didn’t know much about the southern part of Gyeonggi Province because they were not able to contact people like door-to-door vendors due to their movement restrictions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But that terrifying bomb didn’t work well against Sungwoo. Why?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon still could not forget that scene. The moment his elite Crusader Team was momentarily disabled, Sungwoo moved forward proudly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Anyway, it was a great success for Sungwoo. In my opinion, there was a buff working on it. When he used that, his pupils got bigger and he smiled unwittingly. It’s a kind of arousal response. When I checked it, there was even an increase in stats.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum’s job was a 3-star “Scout,” so he could know the opponent’s level and job through his exclusive passive skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In addition, he was able to see the opponent’s detailed stats by consuming a lot of mana, but the moment Sungwoo emerged from the black smoke, his stats slightly increased.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander, why did you decide to hand out the boss raid rewards to that guy?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I couldn’t help it. Without such rewards, he said he would not participate in the raid, but losing him would be a huge loss for us. Haven’t we all witnessed his fighting prowess?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum suddenly felt tired, so he opened his mouth, rubbing his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander, our ultimate enemy may not be a monster. Don’t you know it? At the end of the day, we may end up fighting people, not monsters.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon shook his head slowly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Not right now. We need people right now. Someone like a necromancer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hmm…Then, please leave the details related to the contract to me. The contract can mean different things, depending on the people involved. Let me subtly propose a suggestion that promotes our best interests. You know how important it is to get raid rewards, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon nodded after agonizing a bit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Just go ahead. Instead, you should not make Sungwoo turn against us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Of course not. He won’t notice that I’m pulling the wool over his eyes.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Nodding at him, Junghoon gazed at the direction where Sungwoo disappeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Necromancer…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that time, Sungwoo was facing the final phase of the Hidden Stage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And again this time he stood at a crossroad. Immediately after climbing the corridor and stairs on the second floor, he found the arrow pointing to the left and right.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘On the right is a box…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the end of the corridor on the right was a small box.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘There is a box on the left, too.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>And there was also a box at the end of the left hallway. The difference was that the box was large enough to be 3 meters wide and 2 meters high.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how much he compared the two, it seemed that the left box was a more risky choice, yet one with a greater reward.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the skeletons walking ahead and surrounding him, he walked toward the large box. In fantasy games, a trap was usually installed near such a treasure chest, but nothing happened until he got closer to the box.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I feel nervous. Very strange that nothing has happened like this.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He stopped about 5 meters away from the box. Then, he lifted the repeating crossbow and fired arrows at the edge of the box.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the lid of the box flung open suddenly, revealing vicious teeth like a crocodile’s.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was no treasure in it. It was a Mimic, a human-eating ghost disguised as a box to eat humans.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quack! Quack! Quack!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Mimic began to approach him threateningly, gnashing his large teeth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I can’t get to that monster.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It had a huge mouth with a considerable jaw strength.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If bitten by a Mimic, it seemed that even a skeleton would be crushed immediately. Moreover, since its whole body was a wooden box, there was no chance that arrows or javelins would be effective.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If that’s the case…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Death Response’ begins in the area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned ten zombies, then had them charge towards Mimic with full force.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But these weak zombies couldn’t stop the Mimic. Soon, it opened his huge mouth and swallowed up two zombies at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quack! Quack! Quack!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a bloody scream, the bodies of the zombies began to shatter and disintegrate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But that’s exactly what Sungwoo intended. He took a step back and hid behind the Werebear skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, if you eat anything like that, you’re in big trouble…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kwaaaaang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A series of explosions occurred inside the Mimic’s body, shattering it to pieces into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a Corpse Explosion attack based on the corpse of a zombie.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have accumulated 200 by hunting the super-large Mimic. (Cumulative: 1,084)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have successfully cleared Step 4! (Rank: A+)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have accumulated 350 points. (Cumulative: 1,434)<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Sungwoo achieved the final stage. Then, a golden icon in the shape of a gift emerged from the classroom at the end of the hallway. At first glance, he felt it was time to exchange all the points that he accumulated so far.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You entered the Room of Reward. </div><h2 id="chapter81">Chapter 81</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Rattle- Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/>Upon entering the classroom, the six lockers at the back opened by themselves, and there were different items in them.<br/><br/>But Sungwoo couldn’t take all of them. A purple chain icon appeared at the entrance of each locker. It was a ‘seal’ sign that he had already seen several times.<br/><br/>Sungwoo approached the lockers and looked at the items one by one.<br/><br/>-C-class equipment reinforcement stone (200 points)<br/><br/>-Class C physical strength ampoule (400 points)<br/><br/>-Class C physical strength ampoule (400 points)<br/><br/>-Class C EXP card (300 points)<br/><br/>-Panacea (500 points)<br/><br/>-Parchment of Oath (500 points)<br/><br/>He could understand most of the items without any explanation. There was nothing unusual.<br/><br/>‘But, all these are items I can’t get at a general store. Items that increase stats and EXP?’<br/><br/>If it were a mass production game, those items could be purchased with cash.<br/><br/>‘But what the heck is this?’<br/><br/>However, the last item, called the ‘Parchment of Oath” was hard for him to understand by looking at its name only. Fortunately, as he approached, its information appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Parchment of Oath<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: Consumption<br/><br/>-Effect: You can make an ‘oath’ with other players. You can put forward one condition to each other, but if you don’t fulfill the condition, you will face death.<br/><br/>“Oh, this seems to be useful.”<br/><br/>The total points that Sungwoo collected until now numbered 1,434.<br/><br/>‘It doesn’t fit perfectly.’<br/><br/>He chose as many of the necessary items as he could.<br/><br/>-You have acquired a ‘C Class equipment reinforcement stone’.<br/><br/>-You have acquired a ‘C class physical strength ampoule’.<br/><br/>-You have obtained a ‘C-Class EXP card’.<br/><br/>-You have acquired ‘Parchment of Oath’.<br/><br/>Thus, he used a total of 1,400 points. Unfortunately, he could not use the remaining 34 points.<br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 13)<br/><br/>-By clearing the ‘Hidden Stage’, all your stats increase as a special reward. (+1)<br/><br/>-150,000 gold will be awarded for your clearing the ‘Hidden Stage’.<br/><br/>Leveling up and increase in stats, plus up to 150,000 gold… If Sungwoo had hunted in the field, it would have been much harder and longer for him to acquire them.<br/><br/>-Choose your level up card.<br/><br/>Stats (random)<br/><br/>Skill (random)<br/><br/>Items (random)<br/><br/>Other (random)<br/><br/>Agility level increased by 3 (confirmed)<br/><br/>After thinking hard about the options, Sungwoo chose number 5, agility as the level up card.<br/><br/>When he reached level 10, he could increase his subordinate spirits by 5 at a time, which satisfied him even now.<br/><br/>Of course he thought he needed to increase his subordinate spirits in preparation for the upcoming battle, but right now, when he didn’t feel they were insufficient, it was the right time to increase them drastically. He knew that just like when he faced the muscle orc “Billy,” he might have to face the moment when he had to fight his opponent alone someday.<br/><br/>-You are supposed to leave the Hidden Stage in 15 seconds.<br/><br/>Sungwoo waited to leave. When 15 seconds passed, the golden portal opened and wrapped around his body then sent him back to the place where he had left, namely, on the road in front of the museum.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>“He’s come back!”<br/><br/>Around him were standing the members of the armored Crusader Team.<br/><br/>“You are finally back! Hey, inform the commander about his return!”<br/><br/>It seemed that at Junghoon’s order, they were guarding the place where Sungwoo disappeared. Apparently Junghoon paid special attention to Sungwoo’s safety.<br/><br/>Soon, Junghoon and the Crusaders Team approached him from the helicopter landing in the square. Jisoo and others appeared from the museum,<br/><br/>“I was embarrassed because you suddenly disappeared.”<br/><br/>“I didn’t expect it, either. I’m sorry to have taken away your precious time.”<br/><br/>“Oh, never mind. It’s worth my investment,” said Junghoon, smiling nicely.<br/><br/>Then he continued, “I’m going to tell you what I couldn’t because of the fuss a little while ago.”<br/><br/>“Yes, go ahead.”<br/><br/>“As for our upcoming raid on Yeouido Boss, can you cooperate?”<br/><br/>Junghoon reached out, but Sungwoo still didn’t hold his hand readily.<br/><br/>“All you have to do is keep the contract.”<br/><br/>“Of course.”<br/><br/>Only after he reassured it, Sungwoo held his hand.<br/><br/>Click! Click!<br/><br/>Then the camera flash popped up again. When Sungwoo frowned, Junghoon said, “You may feel bad because I haven’t told you in advance, but I’m going to post these pictures on the community bulletin.”<br/><br/>“Community bulletin? Are these photos posted in the community bulletin?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought that they could post only articles and comments, not pictures like this.<br/><br/>“The job that man chose is a ‘photographer’. He has the skills and items to upload photos on the community bulletin.”<br/><br/>It seemed that there were all kinds of job categories in the community under Junghoon’s control. But Sungwoo was not willing to accept his request readily.<br/><br/>“Why do you want to post such pictures?”<br/><br/>“Well, you may think this looks pompous, but I think it will be a hope for the people. I’m ashamed to say this, but aren’t we called heroes? Wouldn’t they think differently if the photos of us joining hands were uploaded to the community bulletin?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded, but he was not yet persuaded, given his expression.<br/><br/>“I think you mean well, but I don’t want to see the pictures of my face posted on the community bulletin. I feel uncomfortable about the fact that my face and identity is exposed there in this horrible world where people kill each other to survive.”<br/><br/>Junghoon felt that he could not persuade Sungwoo easily the way he wanted to.<br/><br/>“Then I’ll give you 5,000 gold for each picture of your face.”<br/><br/>At last, Junghoon came up with a deal that involved compensation.<br/><br/>This was actually what Sungwoo wanted deep down.<br/><br/>Disclosure of his personal information could be dangerous, but Sungwoo thought he could make good use of it because it would reinforce his image as a hero.<br/><br/>Besides, if he could obtain such a huge amount of gold, it would be a profitable deal, he thought.<br/><br/>‘But 5,000 gold is not sufficient. I can get more.’<br/><br/>Five thousand gold was a huge amount to him a little while ago, but he could obtain that much easily now.<br/><br/>“Well, I want more. How about 10,000 gold?”<br/><br/>Junghoon flinched a moment at his offer, but he calculated the gains and losses in his head for a moment, then nodded. “Okay, deal.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo added, “And the amount of gold applies only now, and in the future it may be adjusted to reflect the amount of gold released.”<br/><br/>“Sure,” Junghoon said.<br/><br/>The two groups pulled off the deal on the boss raid team. And the picture of Junghoon and Sungwoo shaking hands was like a temporary contract because the entire Korean server would know it through the community bulletin.<br/><br/>“As for the contract you mentioned before, namely the fair distribution of the raid rewards, I think we have to discuss it later because we have to form a team accurately first.”<br/><br/>“No problem.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Junghoo had calculations on their own when they glossed over the contract with verbal commitment like that.<br/><br/>So, their business deal was done.<br/><br/>Junghoon suggested they should act together immediately, but Sungwoo said he would join three days later. Junghoon did not ask again and promised to send him a helicopter in three days.<br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/>The Crusader Team boarded the two fine helicopters at once. The rotors were starting to spin faster and faster.<br/><br/>“I am very glad to see you today. When I met you today, I no longer feel like I’m fighting alone. Well, I’ll see you in three days.”<br/><br/>“Yes. Take care.”<br/><br/>The helicopters took off and disappeared into the northern sky. Sungwoo didn’t notice it, but Junghoon left behind two ice boxes before he left.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, these are all potions,” said Hanho.<br/><br/>Two ice boxes were filled with all kinds of potions. When he checked the item information, it was clear that they were normal potions.<br/><br/>“When you met him, did you think Junghoon was a really good person?”<br/><br/>“Well, we’ll wait and see.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t deny what Hanho said. Junghoo might be a really good person, or Sungwwoo might have been deceived by him.<br/><br/>“What should we do from now on, Sungwoo? You don’t want to do it again?”<br/><br/>“Of course, we have to hunt.”<br/><br/>It was time to collect more gold before he joins Junghoon in his boss raid.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Hanho shouted while checking the community bulletin.<br/><br/>“There is a tremendous response to your meeting with the Youngdungpo Prosecutor on the community bulletin right now. It triggered the most comments except for the first comment in the history of the community. 488 comments!” Hanho made a big fuss over it.<br/><br/>Hours after the Crusader Team left, there was a comment with a couple of pictures, the first of its kind in the community bulletin.<br/><br/>Of course, the pictures showed the Crusader Team’s visit to Suwon and the two group leaders shaking hands.<br/><br/>Hanhoo began to read one of the comments.<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter82">Chapter 82</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            In the meantime, Sungwoo discovered some new information. When the biker gang who came up from Osan attacked Sungwoo and his party, Hanho’s father, Jungho opened a Safety Zone. When he maintained it for some time, he leveled up.<br/><br/>“It looks like we can level up even if we are not hunting.”<br/><br/>In fact, Sungwoo could confirm it a few days ago when the cooks making food for Sungwoo’s party levelled up.<br/><br/>However, in the case of Jungho’s job, ‘Pioneer’, he had to consume gold in order to use his skills. So, he thought one level would be enough because he needed to open up the Safety Zone only in contingencies.<br/><br/>However, Jungho chose the skill item from the level up cards, which turned out to be ‘Installation of Defense Position’ card.<br/><br/>“Well, let me see. It says I can install a guard post that gives a barrier and an attack buff near the Safety Zone. Wow, I think I chose a perfect card, don’t you think?” asked Jungho.<br/><br/>“Dad, you’re only level 2. You’re a beginner in this field,” said Hanho.<br/><br/>“What? Hanho, since you chose a Thief card, you don’t deserve to be in town. Just go somewhere in the mountains and eat herbs to survive!”<br/><br/>“Gosh, such a thief only appears in a traditional fairy tale. You don’t know this, but a thief in fantasy games is regarded as the best job!”<br/><br/>“What a lie!” Jisu next to Jungho said.<br/><br/>“What did you say, sissy Jisu? You’re so mean.”<br/><br/>“Oh, did you hear me?”<br/><br/>Anyway, Sungwoo asked Jungho to keep installing a Safety Zone whenever he could find time to see Hanho’s father.<br/><br/>“And when you level up, just draw a skill card unconditionally. I think you can draw a good card with your level as it is now.”<br/><br/>“Sure. I thought you would recognize my skills. How can my only son Hanho tell me I’m a beginner?”<br/><br/>The skill mechanism of his ‘Pioneer Skil’ would allow Jungho to install various facilities within the Safety Zone.<br/><br/>It was possible that one day, a shop or a blacksmith could be installed in the Safety Zone.<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought that’s a good possibility.<br/><br/>And, in fact, that was what he needed the most right now.<br/><br/>[Player Profile]<br/><br/>-Name: Sungwoo Yu<br/><br/>-Level: 13<br/><br/>-Job: Necromancer, Black Wizard<br/><br/>-Ability: Physical Strength (14+6), Agility (11), Stamina (8)<br/><br/>-Gold reserve: 1,061,299<br/><br/>-Attribute: Chaos<br/><br/>The gold in Sungwoo’s possession exceeded 1 million. In addition to the gold that he collected steadily, he earned considerable gold by killing a number of bikers yesterday, and he also earned 150,000 gold at once by clearing the Hidden Stage.<br/><br/>Besides, he sold a few photos to Junghoon and earned a considerable income of 60,000 gold.<br/><br/>In other words, he was in a situation where he could not spend this enormous amount of money properly because Taesung, who was in charge of the shop search mission, returned empty-handed every time.<br/><br/>“Captain, I found a store in Hyangnam, but someone smashed it. Who the hell did this?” asked Taesung.<br/><br/>This was a serious problem. The use of gold was not only directly connected to the reduction in power, but also had a great influence on people’s lives. In other words, gold was nothing but survival itself.<br/><br/>There was no guarantee that Jungho could pick skills such as installation of a shop, so there was no other way than finding an outside shop for now.<br/><br/>“Kyongsu, the next time you find a good store, please dispatch a crackdown team on standby there to defend it,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/>“Got it. Taesung, if you find a store, send me a secret text message right away,” said Kyongsu.<br/><br/>“Will do, brother.”<br/><br/>It was true that the unidentified group was dangerous, but Sungwoo did not express his feelings.<br/><br/>‘Even if I told them, the situation would be more or less the same anyway.’<br/><br/>So, all he had to do was to hunt and raise his level and collect more gold. He would use gold when he found a store because he didn’t have to worry about losing gold.<br/><br/>“Oh, let me use the bait we developed yesterday. Hanho, ask your mother to prepare it.”<br/><br/>In addition, they developed a more efficient, new hunting method.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Stinky Wolf Cooking<br/><br/>-Class: Unknown<br/><br/>-Category: Player’s Manufacture Item<br/><br/>-Effect: Whoever eats it will throw it up. It will attract nearby monsters.<br/><br/>-Description: Please take note! Never go indoors! Gas! Gas! (Manufacturer’s skill)<br/><br/>It was an item that the cooks created when they failed to cook something edible while researching food that gave out buffs.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the kobolts began to appear from the sewer after smelling the savory taste. It may be disgusting to humans, but it smelled delicious to monsters.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo’s party decided to use it. Instead of hunting monsters hiding in buildings or down the drains, they decided to set up a trap to lure them by using this stinking food.<br/><br/>And that operation was pretty effective. Not only goblins and Orcs around but also Direwoves wandering around quite a large area were often caught by the trap.<br/><br/>“Well, I feel like I’m going fishing with this.”<br/><br/>“I was feeling the same way.”<br/><br/>So, they could save time searching for monsters by hunting a large number of monsters easily for the past two days.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there was no good news about their levelling up.<br/><br/>‘There are only two more levels left until I reach Level 15.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo again confirmed the ‘C-Class EXP Card’ he obtained from the Hidden Stage.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: C-level EXP coupon<br/><br/>-Grade: Hidden<br/><br/>-Category:cConsumption<br/><br/>-Effect: A large amount of EXP can be obtained when used. It glows green when it reaches the level-up experience value through this card.<br/><br/>The card was not giving any light at the moment. It meant that even if Sungwoo used it, he could not expect to level up.<br/><br/>At that moment Hanho, who was looking out the window, tapped Sungwoo’s arm.<br/><br/>Something suddenly appeared before their eyes.<br/><br/>Kekeke!<br/><br/>“Damn it! Goblin again? What a stupid goblin that hardly offers gold or EXP!”<br/><br/>Hanho then cursed profusely. After setting up a trap, he was hiding in a nearby building, but he hunted a goblin three times in a row.<br/><br/>Crackle, crackle!<br/><br/>“Oh, you’re an exception. Cute boy. By the way, your bones seem to be turning yellow more and more?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t even have to go out, so he stuck the repeating crossbow out of the window.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, wait a minute.” Jisu shouted, feeling something strange.<br/><br/>“Something is coming up toward us!”<br/><br/>As she levelled up, it seemed that she sharpened her senses more and more. It was also a characteristic of her job as ‘Delicate Sense’ with which she was engaged in a super short-range battle. Accordingly, she was learning how to read people’s movements around her.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Sungwoo also felt some movement on the roof of the building.<br/><br/>“Werewolf!”<br/><br/>“Oh, it seems like we’re going to have a good game finally.”<br/><br/>“No, it’s a little different.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo felt something strange after checking the Werewolf’s movement. Unlike a savage beast, the Werewolf was moving rather carefully.<br/><br/>‘Is that the same Werewolf that I had seen in that alley?’<br/><br/>He felt like it was the calm Werewolf that he encountered while chasing the golden deer.<br/><br/>Back then, the moment he made eye contact with that Werewolf, he suddenly felt uneasy because its eyes were obviously human eyes.That’s why Sungwoo didn’t go to the trouble of chasing it. Sungwoo’s instinct warned him that he might be in a great unknown danger if he blindlessly chased the Werewolf.<br/><br/>“There are a total of three Werewolves.”<br/><br/>But right now that same Werewolf was mixed among the three. At first glance, they all looked similar, but before they had turned into Werewolves, they were essentially human beings who looked different from each other in their build and faces.<br/><br/>“Man, there is one more on the roof.”<br/><br/>Kieeeeh! Kieh!<br/><br/>When the Werewolves appeared, the goblins began to run away, startled, but it was too late.<br/><br/>Two Werewolves rushed and slaughtered the running goblins in no time.<br/><br/>But the third one walked steadily among them. Obviously, this Werewolf was higher in rank.<br/><br/>“Let’s surround them. Something is weird, so we have to be more careful than usual.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo mobilized his subordinate skeletons. As the Werewolves were beasts with good senses, the skeletons had to be more accurate than ever.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Sungwoo had them surround the Werewolves at a tremendous speed rather than secretly approaching them. The human skeletons dispersed in all directions, blocking the ways where the Werewolves could escape.<br/><br/>Gruuuuuuuh!<br/><br/>The Werewolves found the skeletons and lowered their posture before they moved back to back, which could be never found in uncivilized beasts at all, as Sungwoo expected.<br/><br/>He then raised the repeating crossbow at them.<br/><br/>At that moment, one of them shouted, “Don’t shoot!”<br/><br/>“Uh? Did they say something?” Hanho shouted at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo did not put down the crossbow, shouting back, “Explain to me clearly why I shouldn’t shoot.”<br/><br/>Just because the Werewolves knew how to speak human language didn’t mean they were Sungwoo’s ally. Even humans were killing each other, so it’s only natural that he should be wary of the Werewolf.<br/><br/>Sungwoo continued, “And if you talk nonsense, I’ll peel your skin off right away. You are seeing your old fellows without any skin, right?”<br/><br/>Rather, the Werewolves that knew how to speak were more dangerous. One of them, who seemed to be higher in rank than other Werewolves, stepped forward.<br/><br/>“I know you want to ask us something. You might wonder how we came to our senses, right? Now, let’s talk about it slowly, gentlemanly.”<br/><br/>The Werewolf tried to negotiate with Sungwoo over it. Obviously, Sungwoo was curious about it, too.<br/><br/>“You’re mistaken. The fact that you’re like a human is a black mark against you.”<br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuuh!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo shot an arrow into his chest. The next moment the Weretiger jumped from the roof of the building behind his back.<br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/>The Weretiger was holding the head of one Werewolf in one hand and a crossbow in the other. The Werewolf in question was caught by the Weretiger while trying to ambush Sungwoo from behind.<br/><br/>“Hey, don’t try to rack your brain like a human. Just be faithful to your animal instinct! If you don’t listen to me, I’m going to strike you hard,” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuh…”<br/><br/>“Okay, tell me. How did you guys come back to your senses?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was really curious about it. </div><h2 id="chapter83">Chapter 83</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Werewolves were a very strong race, so they were not killed just because they were hit with a few arrows.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuh…”<br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/>The Werewolf pulled out the arrow stuck in his chest. Blood spilled over his fur, but the wound would soon recover, but it didn’t mean he could break through the skeletons’ siege. Since he was surrounded by so many skeletons, there was no way he could escape no matter how hard he tried.<br/><br/>“It looks like the arrow wasn’t stuck in his mouth, but why couldn’t he speak?”<br/><br/>At that moment, the Werewolf immediately opened his mouth, “It is a quest…”<br/><br/>“Quest?”<br/><br/>“Right. When we become quest beasts and lose our reason, we are given a quest. I don’t have the power to discern what it is, but I instinctively follow it,” the Werewolf replied.<br/><br/>The player acts as the “horse” of this game, and the quest imposes its purpose on that player.<br/><br/>What the Werewolf meant was that even a similar system was being applied to those who could not become players and the human beasts.<br/><br/>“What the heck is it?”<br/><br/>“Simple. All I have to do is eat humans. I need to eat a total of ten humans.”<br/><br/>The Werewolf’s message was clear and menacing.<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded and said, “After that, you come back to your senses.”<br/><br/>“Right.”<br/><br/>There was a reason why the human beasts ran around like crazy when they found humans. The instinct forced by the system prodded them to eat humans by all means.<br/><br/>“Are there any more Werewolves like you?”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo asked, he blew a nostril and said, “Of course there are. Almost all the humans were killed, but there are still lots of stupid players everywhere.”<br/><br/>“That’s not what I’m asking you. I’m asking you if there are more like you in this area.”<br/><br/>The Werewolf couldn’t open his mouth, which meant he admitted it.<br/><br/>“Yes, there are more.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“Let me ask you one more question. Were you responsible for breaking the stores?”<br/><br/>Those who destroyed the stores left a message without any exception. And there was a reasonable suspicion that the message seemed to have been written in something like claws.<br/><br/>But the Werewolf shook his head and said, “We’re not responsible for that.”<br/><br/>“How can I believe you?”<br/><br/>Another Werewolf standing behind Sungwoo stepped out and shouted angrily, “We are not real! There are other guys here!”<br/><br/>“You, shut up!”<br/><br/>“Uncle, but…”<br/><br/>“I told you to shut up!”<br/><br/>The Werewolf, called uncle by another Werewolf, pressed down his shoulder hard.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo raised his eyebrows at that. Other Werewolves?<br/><br/>“Other guys? I need to know who they are,” Sungwoo demanded.<br/><br/>The uncle Werewolf looked somewhat embarrassed, but soon opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“Hah… We just get by to survive. After we have restored our reason, we hardly hunt humans, but there are some of us who have extreme hostility towards humans. They unite and attack the players. Breaking the stores would weaken the players, of course.”<br/><br/>“Is it something like an anti-human coalition of human beasts?”<br/><br/>The uncle shook his head and said, “There are not just human beasts. Even mad scientists whose identities are a mystery joined. In fact, they are the main pillars of the coalition, and the human beasts joined them later.”<br/><br/>Human beasts and mad scientists who hate human players? Sungwoo smelled a rat.<br/><br/>‘Are they the door-to-door sellers?’<br/><br/>They made weird items, which included several items related to ‘Human Beast Transformation Ampoule,’ in particular.<br/><br/>When Sungwoo was lost in thought for a moment, the Werewolf’s attitude began to change. The Werewolf, called uncle, pulled out the arrow stuck in his body and stood, squaring his shoulders.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, a few more Werewolves approached nearer to you.”<br/><br/>Apparently, this group of human beasts had a fairly systematic hunting method.<br/><br/>They placed snipers in the rear and rooftop of the building. Besides, their reinforcements appeared as soon as they were in danger. Obviously, there must have been reinforcements that Sungwoo didn’t notice.<br/><br/>The wounded Werewolf’s eyes were tense. As if he decided something, however, the uncle Werewolf began to stare at Sungwoo, while holding and opening his fingers.<br/><br/>There was a murderous intent in his eyes now.<br/><br/>“I’m sorry, but I thought about it carefully. We’ve known for a long time that you’re spying on this area. So, we thought we would clash with you someday.”<br/><br/>“Don’t make a mistake. I recommend you to think a little more whether you have come to a wise conclusion.”<br/><br/>The Werewolf made a strange expression. Sungwoo didn’t know much about a wolf’s expression, but obviously it looked lonely.<br/><br/>“I planned to kill you soon. I just had to pull the sword faster than I thought. I wanted to have a conversation with you, but I didn’t have the nerve to do so because of our miserable situation at the moment. Players can’t like this kind of situation we are in now. And we also want to survive… Seriously,” the Werewolf said.<br/><br/>“I understand, but I don’t think I can grant your wish.”<br/><br/>At that moment, the wind blew and the arrows were flying.<br/><br/>A pile of bones arose from the bag next to Sungwoo then merged at once. It was the Werewolf’s bone shield.<br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/>Arrows stuck in the shield. After the village was formed and the daily necessities were emptied from the backpack, it was filled with bones so that weapons could be manufactured at any time.<br/><br/>“Hey, I told you that you clearly made a mistake. It looks like you didn’t monitor me carefully, though you said you were keeping an eye on me,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Cling! Cling!<br/><br/>Jisu swung her sword to block the incoming arrows, and Hanho threw himself behind the Werebear skeleton.<br/><br/>Sungwoo ruthlessly fired arrows from the repeating crossbow in his right hand, while lifting the shield with his left hand.<br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/>“Argh! Hide behind me!”<br/><br/>The uncle Werewolf turned around and blocked the arrows. Then he hugged two other Werewolves to protect them. Sungwoo felt sorry for his tearful sacrifice, but he couldn’t afford to show compassion now.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuah!<br/><br/>Human beasts began to come out from all directions in no time.<br/><br/>“They are coming in droves!” Hanho shouted.<br/><br/>Four Werewolves jumped down from the rooftop, and two Werebears ran from the back alley. Then, three human beasts, totally strange to Sungwoo, climbed the wall to rush to him.<br/><br/>They were ‘Wererats.’ They were relatively small, standing 1 meter and 70 cm tall.<br/><br/>“Smash all those skeletons!”<br/><br/>There were twelve human beasts. Obviously, they were very powerful opponents. Given that they were given a quest, it’s highly likely that they would be given a synergy effect, too.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo and his party were clearly different from them in terms of EXP, command organization and armament.<br/><br/>‘It’s time to throw spears.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo has fought numerous battles so far. Faced with large-scale battles and overwhelming boss monsters, he always turned the battles in his favor.<br/><br/>No matter how superhuman the human beasts were, they could not cope with the skeleton forces that moved like machines as long as they had human emotions.<br/><br/>A pile of bones sprang up from the backpacks that the skeletons were carrying on their back. Then, the bones turned into long spears. The skeletons picked up the spears and charged towards the human beasts.<br/><br/>Then, the skeletons threw the spears at them with terrifying force. The human beasts could put up with the wounds caused by the arrows, but it was hard for them to deal with the powerful spears that they were throwing.<br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/>One of the spears stuck right in the neck of the Werebear charging at them. He staggered to the other side and eventually fell to the floor.<br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/>The same was true of other human beasts. They recklessly tried to attack the skeletons, but they fell down, hit by the spears. Since they were so strong, they were not killed immediately, but the spears dealt a severe blow, so much so that they were totally incapaciated.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>Bloody fighting was going on everywhere, but it was the human beasts who were groaning in terrible pain.<br/><br/>“Argh…Ahhhhh…”<br/><br/>And their groaning gradually faded.<br/><br/>“I clearly told you that you made a mistake,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Cough…cough!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo approached the Weirwolf who looked like a hedgehog. Arrows were stuck all over his back, including his neck. </div><h2 id="chapter84">Chapter 84</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Although the uncle Werewolf hugged the other two Werewolves to protect them, he couldn’t avoid the arrows fired from the repeating crossbow, which rained down on the two.<br/><br/>“Well, I kept making the mistake even before I drew the card… Damn it, that’s my biggest mistake.”<br/><br/>“Don’t resent me.”<br/><br/>“I don’t resent you, but it’s unfair… I’ve made the choice for all of us to survive, but I failed completely. Good luck…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled out the Ownerless Sword, then cut the Werewolves that were still breathing.<br/><br/>-Days left until you prove your qualifications: 4,836 days<br/><br/>Only five days were reduced per animal. It looked like even killing a powerful monster didn’t give him any weight, compared to ordinary ones.<br/><br/>Looking around, Sungwoo discovered that the fighting was over. In fact, the Werewolves mounted a meaningless attack from the beginning without checking their opponent’s strength.<br/><br/>“Oh, I feel somewhat uncomfortable. You know what? They hugged each other to protect themselves. I flinched at that moment.”<br/><br/>“Well, they’re all the same anyway. The bikers we killed yesterday must have had their own families.”<br/><br/>“You’re right. They’re all the same.”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo and Hanho were chatting like that, Jisu was still looking somewhere, holding his sword.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, it’s not over yet.”<br/><br/>A relatively small Werewolf stood at the corner of the alley, looking at them blankly. He made eye contact with Sungwoo. And the next moment, he ran away into the alley.<br/><br/>“If you miss him, we’re in trouble.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was unclear what would happen if even a single Werewolf was allowed to escape when he didn’t know yet how many human beasts were still alive in the area. Since Sungwoo had to head to Youngdungpo in no time, he had to get rid of any remaining Werewolves.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party began to chase the small Werewolf. He ran back and forth between the alleys as if he tried to give them the slip, but soon, he came out into the street.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, if you go this way, you will arrive at Suwon Station!”<br/><br/>Like Hanho said, when Sungwoo got out of the alley and entered the street, he noticed the building of Suwon Station in front of him.<br/><br/>The Werewolf started sprinting toward Suwon Station. Then, he went across an abandoned road, and ran right into Suwon Station.<br/><br/>“Where is that guy running?”<br/><br/>He tried to go down the stairs to the basement of Exit 5 Gate but quickly turned around.<br/><br/>Right at that moment he screamed, “Argh!”<br/><br/>Something stuck in his body, making him slow down.<br/><br/>Eventually, he flopped down on the floor.<br/><br/>“Wait a minute. I see something strange out there.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo stopped and hid behind the car. His party also dispersed in all directions and hid behind the cars abandoned on the street.<br/><br/>“Help me! Aaaaah!”<br/><br/>The Werewolf shouted, scratching his leg with his hand hard. A sticky white substance was stuck to his leg.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuk! It’s a dog sausage! Thanks for the food!”<br/><br/>“Hey, don’t touch it! It’s a gift for our Queen!”<br/><br/>A group of Kobolds appeared on the stairs of Exit 5 Gate. Then, they stabbed something like a long stick in the Werewolf’s thigh.<br/><br/>“Argh! Uhhhhhhhh…” The Werewolf’s body started to stiffen. It looked like he had not been killed but paralyzed by a poisoned needle.<br/><br/>As expected, the Kobolds dragged the Werewolf away, using some hybrid language that Sungwoo could never understand.<br/><br/>“Dang it. They were only Kobolds. How come they could attack the Werewolf?” Hanho asked.<br/><br/>The Kobolds were clearly a weak race. However, by using all kinds of wicked tricks, they hunted a race stronger than themselves. The same was true of the Kobolds he had met at the supermarket some time ago.<br/><br/>Sungwoo raised his head and looked up at the Suwon Station building. As usual with a station located downtown, it was a “private capital station” with several department store buildings connected to the station.<br/><br/>“Huh? What is that?”<br/><br/>There was a familiar icon appearing under the sign ‘Suwon Station’ at the top of the building. It was a green coin icon showing a store.<br/><br/>“It’s a store. But that’s…”<br/><br/>But right above it was another icon. It was a red cave-shaped icon.<br/><br/>“It’s a dungeon. There is a dungeon in the building.”<br/><br/>In fact, the entire Suwon Station was a dungeon.<br/><br/>And there was a shop inside the building which they had been looking for so earnestly.<br/><br/>“Let’s go there.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party stood in front of Exit 5 Gate, the nearest entrance to the station.<br/><br/>“Ah, wait a minute.”<br/><br/>The stairs going down to the basement were different from the usual stairs. Since no interior lights were on, darkness became thicker inside, and the underground passages underneath it looked infinitely deep.<br/><br/>Hanho rubbed his arms as if he had goosebumps.<br/><br/>He said, “Sungwoo, I gave you a warning yesterday, but should we really go down? I’m opposed.”<br/><br/>Instead of answering, Sungwoo went down the stairs.<br/><br/>“Look, you can’t go any further, right?” said Hanho.<br/><br/>But Sungwoo had no reason to go back because it was a golden chance to obtain EXP and a store.<br/><br/>-You have entered the large-scale dungeon ‘Tarantula Queen’s Bedroom.’<br/><br/>*Caution! It is a ‘cannibal dungeon’ that took the lives of 124 players. The reward for clearing the dungeon increases. (+50%)<br/><br/>“Damn it! Spider? How come the whole Suwon Station is the bedroom? If that’s the case, how big is the spider?”<br/><br/>With Hanho shuddering from his ominous imagination, they entered the deep and wide dungeon.<br/><br/>In fact, Sungwoo used to commute to and from Suwon Station in the past. He had to pass through the underground passage to commute to school everyday.<br/><br/>“Is it the same Suwon Station we used to know?”<br/><br/>However, it was only an underground cave filled with filthy water and an absence of humans. They lit a light and went further into the dark passage.<br/><br/>“Oh, it’s so humid here.”<br/><br/>Since the drainage system broke down, water was filling it from deep underground. It seemed that it would completely flood the cave in the near future.<br/><br/>Drip, drip.<br/><br/>Somewhere the sound of dripping water was heard. A heap of moss was already growing on the walls, and tough spider webs blocked the passage. On such occasions, Jisu took out her sword and burnt them.<br/><br/>They arrived at the first basement of the station.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, look over there!”<br/><br/>Hanho grabbed his arm then pointed the light toward the ceiling.<br/><br/>“Humans?”<br/><br/>Like Hanho said, there was a man hanging near the ceiling. It wasn’t one or two.<br/><br/>Ten people were clinging to the ceiling, trapped in spider webs. All kinds of flying insects were stuck to them that looked like a huge wad of dough.<br/><br/>But when the light shone on then, those stuck in the spider webs started to wriggle, as if waking up from sleep.<br/><br/>They were alive.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this? They’re moving. Are they zombies?”<br/><br/>One of them opened his eyes.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuh… help me…”<br/><br/>When he barely spoke with all his might, something crawled out of his mouth. It was a spider.<br/><br/>Sungwoo noticed that the man’s neck was wriggling abnormally. Soon the strange object passed through his chest and down his belly. It was an ominous sign.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuh…”<br/><br/>That man trembled and began to vomit spiders. The next moment, his stomach swelled and blood poured out.<br/><br/>Chiric! Chiric! Chiric!<br/><br/>“Oh my God! What the heck is that?”<br/><br/>Hundreds of spiders began to crawl out of his torn stomach. The man’s eyes rolled back into his head then his head fell down.<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party immediately stepped back. Soon, even those who were hanging around him began to struggle in pain. It was obvious what would happen to them. Sungwoo could not let this go on unchecked.<br/><br/>“Explode!” He shouted.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo shouted, the man’s whole body exploded. The flames instantly blew away the young spiders and burned all the spider webs around him.<br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>Sungwoo triggered the Corpse Explosion on the bodies of the dead one by one.<br/><br/>Then, all the baby spiders that were roaming inside them were burned and barbecued.<br/><br/>-You have earned 1,300 gold by removing the giant spider egg nest.<br/><br/>-You have earned 1,300 gold by removing the giant spider egg nest.<br/><br/>“How could they lay eggs in a living person’s body! Crazy…”<br/><br/>“Let’s pay attention to what we hear while we are moving.”<br/><br/>They left behind the terrible scene and went further.<br/><br/>Suwon Station was connected to a department store building. They walked up the escalator that stopped running.<br/><br/>When they arrived on the third floor, they heard lots of voices from somewhere.<br/><br/>“Explosion? I was surprised! Boom!”<br/><br/>“They are down there!” </div><h2 id="chapter85">Chapter 85</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Explosion? Isn’t it too dangerous?” Hanho asked, wiping the cold sweat off his forehead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If Sungwoo had used it wrong, even his party would have crashed into the pit, and the building itself could have collapsed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I’m using the explosion card at the risk of our lives.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no! Please tell me you have made sure of our safety first before using it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alright, let me do it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party carefully passed by the unbroken floor and moved to the final gateway of the dungeon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are we heading in the direction of the theater?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Tarantula Queen’s bedroom was the largest 3D hall of the movie house. A new message appeared before them in front of the theater.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! This is the boss room of the ‘Cannibal Dungeon’ that killed 124 players. Some rewards will be issued even if you stop attacking here. Would you like to enter anyway?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I feel a bit uncomfortable entering a narrow theater like this,” said Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, this must be a really difficult place, given this kind of message. Sungwoo, are you going to push ahead whatever the results may be?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time, even Sungwoo did not move quickly, for a warning message like this indicated that the spider queen was a very formidable opponent. Besides, they were supposed to face a greater threat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I have to face stronger monsters in the future.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>If he gave up here and turned back, there was no chance that he would get anywhere because he would have to face a greater risk anyway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I thought you would…” Hanho moaned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To get the best out of this operation Sungwoo took some time to realign his forces. And he repositioned all the skeletons in the vacant resting place. Then he had them loaded with the ‘Fellblade’ skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, let’s go inside the theater.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After refreshing their determination strongly, they entered the theater.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Spider webs were all over the place when they stepped in. Because sticky skeins were hanging all over the place, they could hardly move around. Jisu was always ready to swing the sword to burn the spider webs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Be careful, everybody! You should not stick to the wall.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Standing at the highest point in the theater, they shone the light toward the large screen on the stage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The pure white spider webs shimmered, reflecting the light.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come on! Users!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Somewhere a voice rang. It came from the stage under the screen. There was a Kobold standing there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a baseball cap on, he was putting on a short velvet jacket like a coat, with a stick taller than himself in one hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Boss monster “Kobold Shaman” has appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? That son of a bitch is speaking human language clearly, isn’t he?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Hanho spoke with surprise, the Kobold Shaman shouted with a proud expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, it’s because I ate 19 human brains!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You can’t go back once you’re inside the theater. It’s useless to regret your decision now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t know how Kobolds learned the language, but it was fluent in speaking and clumsy in writing the language.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo felt something moving near the upper ceiling of the screen. When he slowly lifted the flashlight toward it there was a huge spider hanging on to the ceiling..<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kurrrrrrr-<br/><br/><br/><br/>A giant spider, more than ten meters long, who curled up in the ceiling, raised her head toward Sungwoo’s party. Her eight eyes glared. Thick hairs grew out of her eight long legs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Under her belly was a swarm of baby spiders crouching together. When the light shone on them, they made a disgusting noise and hurriedly tried to get inside her belly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Boss monster ‘Giant Tarantula Queen’ has appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crazy… But two bosses here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There was a reason why we saw the warning message repeatedly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Tarantula Queen slowly began to spread her long legs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the Kobold Shaman laughed evilly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Khahahahaha! How about it? Aren’t you scared?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What kind of brain did he eat?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s attack them, as we planned,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party had no intention of letting them mount a first strike.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisoo and Hanho dispersed to both sides, while Sungwoo walked ahead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu stabbed the sword right into the wall and lit the spider’s webs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fire in such a small space as this would cause damage to Sungwoo’s party, but the flames would be more lethal to spiders using spider webs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their operation this time was intended for a short-term fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The flames were climbing up the wall and spreading to the ceiling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo triggered the Fellblade right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in the affected area!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Black smoke began to fill the theater.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Aaaah! What the heck is this? You mean humans!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Startled, the Kobold Shaman stuck to the screen, but something flew over his head and exploded. There arose black smoke, too.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was none other than the ‘Abyssal Concentrate Capsule’. A deadly poisonous substance engulfed the two boss monsters, and the baby spiders under the spider queen fell helplessly .<br/><br/><br/><br/>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>After falling on the floor, the baby spiders trembled a bit, then quickly stopped moving, and the Tarantula Queen wriggled and shouted viousuly, moving her fangs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuehhhhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked up at the queen spider. A familiar Werewolf hung near her head. He looked like a mummy as if the spider sucked out all his body fluids.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Around the queen spider hung the offerings dedicated to her. There were a huge number of bodies and bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, it’s good?” The spider queen shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, it meant that it was the best space for the necromancer to move around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ‘Cannibal Dungeon’ swallowed the wrong prey this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>As always, the Crusader Team went ahead with the hunting, as planned. They usually sent a scout team first to understand the location and characteristics of the prey as well as its skill pattern.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thanks for your great work, everybody. This time again, it was a perfect battle.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They just carried out another large-scale operation at the Kuro Railroad Facility of the Korea Railroad Corporation. They succeeded in hunting the “cannibal bat,” which terrified survivors in the region. When it spread its wings, they measured 10 meters in size. Such a huge bat, now stuck on Junghoon’s sword, was displayed on the railroad.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s all thanks to your good coaching, Commander.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s right. Our operation was effective because we ambushed both sides of the facility first and pierced the wings of the bat.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We will keep following your orders, Commander.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The loyalty of the Crusader Team was enormous, and they were Junghoon’s main force.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I’m not No.1 in the players’ ranking, but I think I’m stronger than him,’ Junghoon mumbled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although he had to share EXP with a large number of Crusader Team members due to the nature of the party hunt, he continued a large-scale hunt with overwhelming power, which could not be compared with other players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Furthermore, he had one major skill unique to his job, “Crusader Commander.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You receive part of the EXP of the Crusaders under your command.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You receive part of the EXP of the Crusaders under your command.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, 10 percent of the EXP earned by one Crusader member was offered to Junghoon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, the Crusader Team grew together with their leader, while Junghun could also sweep more EXP than anyone else.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘By the way, Kangsok Han. Who the hell are you?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He couldn’t help but care about Kangsok. Since Junghoon was treated as an unrivaled hero in the Korean server community, he could not understand that he was not ranked No 1, but at the same time he was scared about Kangsok.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘How can he level up so fast?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The symbolism of the No 1 player in ranking was tremendous, because even among the community people there was a tremendous expectation for this unidentified man who was ranked higher than the Youngdungpo Prosecutor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander, I think I can leave in about 10 minutes.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay. Thank you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After they were done preparing to transport the hunted game to Youngdungpo Station by tying them to the train, the Crusader Team were checking the hunting equipment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander! Look at this!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the team members came to see Junghoon. With a cell phone in one hand, he hurried to see him as if he was on an urgent mission.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Look at this ranking…That necromancer!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon took his mobile phone and confirmed it. And his face gradually began to distort.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How come he can…?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>[KOR Server Ranking (Page 1)]<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Kansok Han (LV. 16)<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) kor-157 (LV. 14)<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Youngdungpo Prosecutor (LV. 13)<br/><br/><br/><br/>4) DOCTOR-000 (LV. 13)<br/><br/><br/><br/>5) Yun Choi (LV. 12)<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a change in the ranking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The necromancer began to surpass the hero of Youngdungpo. </div><h2 id="chapter86">Chapter 86</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Explosion? Isn’t it too dangerous?” Hanho asked, wiping the cold sweat off his forehead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If Sungwoo had used it wrong, even his party would have crashed into the pit, and the building itself could have collapsed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I’m using the explosion card at the risk of our lives.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no! Please tell me you have made sure of our safety first before using it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alright, let me do it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party carefully passed by the unbroken floor and moved to the final gateway of the dungeon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are we heading in the direction of the theater?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Tarantula Queen’s bedroom was the largest 3D hall of the movie house. A new message appeared before them in front of the theater.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! This is the boss room of the ‘Cannibal Dungeon’ that killed 124 players. Some rewards will be issued even if you stop attacking here. Would you like to enter anyway?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I feel a bit uncomfortable entering a narrow theater like this,” said Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, this must be a really difficult place, given this kind of message. Sungwoo, are you going to push ahead whatever the results may be?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time, even Sungwoo did not move quickly, for a warning message like this indicated that the spider queen was a very formidable opponent. Besides, they were supposed to face a greater threat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I have to face stronger monsters in the future.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>If he gave up here and turned back, there was no chance that he would get anywhere because he would have to face a greater risk anyway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I thought you would…” Hanho moaned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To get the best out of this operation Sungwoo took some time to realign his forces. And he repositioned all the skeletons in the vacant resting place. Then he had them loaded with the ‘Fellblade’ skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, let’s go inside the theater.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After refreshing their determination strongly, they entered the theater.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Spider webs were all over the place when they stepped in.

                             <br/><br/>“Use all the available means to crush them immediately!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s tactics paid off.<br/><br/>As soon as Jisu burned the spider’s webs, Sungwoo triggered the Fellblade to spread the curse of death. Sungwoo also used the Abyss Concentrate Capsule.<br/><br/>“Argh! Kuuuuuuaaaahhh!”<br/><br/>The Kobold Shaman died with all sorts of spot damage and the weakening of his physical strength by the ‘Crystal of Chaos’. When he almost collapsed from the critical attack, Hanho snuck up on him and slit his neck with a knife.<br/><br/>“Finally! I confirmed the effect of this hood! Did you see it? I am the thief! Hahaha!”<br/><br/>While Hanho rejoiced in finding his job identity, the Tarantula Queen bounced off the wall from the impact of the Corpse Explosion.<br/><br/>Kuuueh! Kuuueh!<br/><br/>The giant queen spider was struggling on the stage with her body turned upside down.<br/><br/>Sungwoo stabbed fifteen javelins into her belly.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuueh!<br/><br/>Nonetheless, she did not die. She seemed to have been overwhelmingly strong given her huge size.<br/><br/>After turning over once, the spider stared at Sungwoo then moved her eight legs to climb on to the seats of the theater. While she was pushing her huge body up, all the seats were ruthlessly crushed all at once.<br/><br/>“Let me use the axe this time.”<br/><br/>At Sungwoo’s order, the bones came out of the skeletons’ backpacks and turned into huge battle axes.<br/><br/>-‘Synergy effect’ is triggered due to team play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Barbarian Warrior (Stage 2)<br/><br/>-Category: Weapon Synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: Load at least 10 axes<br/><br/>-Effect: Attack power increase (15%), attack speed increase (+15%) for 20 seconds with the start of battle<br/><br/>* Wait time 10 minutes<br/><br/>The skeletons grabbed the axes and rushed head-on toward the Tarantula Queen.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>They then dispersed in all directions and began to aim at the cracks in her hard chitin shells caused by the Corpse Explosion.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>In addition, since her defense power was reduced by 10% due to the synergy of  Sungwoo triggered, the skeletons broke through her shell and crushed her flesh.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuehhh!<br/><br/>Freightened, she stretched out her forelimbs and struck down a Werewolf.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>She survived their first attack because she was equipped with bone armor, but she was completely crushed by the impact of their continuous strikes.<br/><br/>-The deceased now becomes a subordinate spirit under your authority.<br/><br/>At that moment, a Werewolf hanging on the spider webs on the ceiling began to wriggle.<br/><br/>All of his skin had been peeled away by the giant queen spider, so he had only bones. He tore off the loose webs and fell towards the head of the Tarantula Queen.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The Werewolf landed on her head, lifted his nails and scratched the queen’s two eyes.<br/><br/>Kuuuuh! Kuuuuuh!<br/><br/>Covered with wounds all over her body, the giant spider desperately struggled.<br/><br/>“Take this!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo threw the ‘Ownerless Sword’ at Orun then threw himself into the shadows created by the flames.<br/><br/>The “Shadow King’s Robe” hid his body. Sungwoo popped out of the shadow again, and fired arrows from the repeating crossbow in a place that the spider had never expected, drawing her attention.<br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/>When Sungwoo was drawing her attention, the Werebear skeleton grabbed Orun by the neck and lifted him up.<br/><br/>“Throw him now!”<br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo gave the order, the skeleton threw Orun quickly as if he was throwing a shot put. Orun flew straight toward the head of the Tarantula Queen like a shell.<br/><br/>Poo-wook!<br/><br/>The Ownerless Sword penetrated her huge head.<br/><br/>Keeeeeh… Thud!<br/><br/>-Days left until you prove your qualifications: 4,636 days<br/><br/>Finally, Sungwoo and his party got rid of the Kobolds and the giant spiders.<br/><br/>It was a perfect victory he achieved by mobilizing all the means available as he originally planned.<br/><br/>-You have earned 30,000 gold by hunting the boss monster “Giant Tarantula Queen” (50% additional applied)<br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 14)<br/><br/>Since it was the largest dungeon battle ever, he received more rewards than expected.<br/><br/>‘I’m finally Level 14. I’ve leveled up even without using my EXP card.’<br/><br/>It was not Sungwoo alone who levelled up.<br/><br/>-The ‘Goblin Skeleton’ has leveled up by absorbing the magic power of the ‘Giant Tarantula Queen’.<br/><br/>* Attack power is greatly increased.<br/><br/>* The attribute of ‘Commander’ has been increased.<br/><br/>Orun’s level was upgraded to Level 4 after absorbing the boss monster, and he took over the role of organizing a company.<br/><br/>Of course, he needed dozens of undead to organize such a company.<br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo selected the ‘skill’ item from the level up cards.<br/><br/>-You can increase the number of your subordinate spirits by up to (+2).<br/><br/>As a result, Sungwoo had a total of seventeen undead under his command.<br/><br/>“I think we can find Death’s Scythe after the raid,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Sungwoo felt that his first awakening was around the corner.<br/><br/>Right after the battle, the players’ rankings were updated and the Crusader Team was shocked to see the new ranking chart. The new ranking was shocking enough to shake the entire Korean server.<br/><br/>Although Sungwoo and Junghoon were heroes who met recently and the photos of them shaking hands was uploaded in the community bulletin, their hierarchy was now clear.<br/><br/>Along with his overwhelming build, Junghoon, the Youngdungpo Prosecutor, leader of the giant guild and No 2 in the current ranking chart, seemed to have hired Sungwoo Yu, the Necromancer and No 3.<br/><br/>But now that their rankings were reversed, the shock was enough to cause severe repercussions.<br/><br/>Some of those who didn’t like the way the Youngdungpo Prosecutor acted until now supported Sungwoo’s advancement in ranking and posted sarcastic comments about Junghoon, while the supporters of Junghoon responded by posting comments supporting their leader. This kind of conflict and acrimony between the two factions in the community grew daily.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I don’t see it here. We should be able to notice a flashing icon in this dark place, but I don’t see one.”<br/><br/>“You bet. There is nothing on the 4th floor. I think I have to go down one more floor.”<br/><br/>Without knowing the growing conflict in the community, Sungwoo and his party were looking for a store after clearing the dungeon in a more relaxed mood. They had seen the dungeon icon as well as the store icon before entering Suwon Station.<br/><br/>“I found it! It was in the Burger King store!”<br/><br/>There was a store icon in the hamburger franchise store located on the third floor of the department store.<br/><br/>Three unmanned kiosks gleamed, and, as expected, retro-style 8-bit music was playing.<br/><br/>“Wow! Finally I can use the crumpled money I saved until now…”<br/><br/>Although Sungwoo’s party participated in the joint hunting, their contributions were different, so the amount of gold each of them earned was different.<br/><br/>While Jisu and Hanho gained around 300,000 gold, Sungwoo already earned more than 1,600,000 gold.<br/><br/>“Wow, you’ve got a huge savings account! You can even get its interest if it is real.”<br/><br/>-Welcome to the C-Class store!<br/><br/>The store was one grade higher than the D-class store in the used car sales complex. This store also seemed to operate in a different way.<br/><br/>The school’s store was a roulette, and the used car dealership’s store was like a lottery.<br/><br/>The store this time was like a slot machine.<br/><br/>Three pictures were rotating on the screen, and there was something like a lever in the right corner.<br/><br/>-For the lucky jackpot!<br/><br/>* C-class stores only sell ‘diamonds’.<br/><br/>This time, even the unit price looked different.<br/><br/>“What the heck? Wasn’t platinum 100,000 gold at the D-class store? Why is it only 10,000 gold here?”<br/><br/>“It looks like something is different here.”<br/><br/>Like Hanho said, the platinum was a tenth of the price compared with the previous store, but the reason for that was clear.<br/><br/>-Slot machine usage rules (!)<br/><br/>In other words, it was offered at a much cheaper price because there was a ‘blank.’<br/><br/>So, if they played slots with insufficient funds, they could not even break even.<br/><br/>‘I’m rather at an advantage here,’ Sungwoo thought.<br/><br/>For a man like Sungwoo who had a huge amount of gold, it was a different story.<br/><br/>Although nobody knew what the odds were, the chances to challenge the game were huge.<br/><br/>At the same time, he could increase the chances of winning with the tokens obtained by drawing a ‘blank.’<br/><br/>“Let me grab the first one. Sungwoo, you always play slots first. It looks like it’s more lucky when you start first,” said Hanho. </div><h2 id="chapter88">Chapter 88</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            There were a total of 3 kiosks, and each of them held one and began to gamble for survival.<br/><br/>-Holding 2 tickets (unlimited level)<br/><br/>‘Let me save this.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo played slots after setting it to diamond grade.<br/><br/>Tidididididididi-<br/><br/>The three rows of pictures began to spin like crazy. Since he could not know what timing would increase the chances of winning at slots, Sungwoo recklessly lowered the lever.<br/><br/>Clank―<br/><br/>The slots started to slow down and stopped with cheap sound effects.<br/><br/>-Blank!<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>“It’s a blank…”<br/><br/>Sunwoo, Hanho and Jisu drew a blank at the same time.<br/><br/>“Do we have a chance of winning at slots at all? Don’t we look like a pushover?”<br/><br/>“Hey, Hanho, don’t you know we became a pushover from the first time when all this happened?”<br/><br/>“I admit it. Whew…”<br/><br/>The three played slots again.<br/><br/>Clank!<br/><br/>-Blank!<br/><br/>Wouldn’t luck come along this time? They played slots two more times, but all of them drew a blank.<br/><br/>They already spent 400,000 gold. Although they gathered a huge amount of tokens thanks to drawing blanks, even Sungwoo got nervous at this point.<br/><br/>‘We can increase the odds of winning by collecting tokens. By then, we can obtain anything.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought this was how those addicted to gambling felt, but this was part of their survival game. Sungwoo once again invested 100,000 gold.<br/><br/>Clank!<br/><br/>-Blank!<br/><br/>As expected, it was a blank again.<br/><br/>-Bonus Chance! (Don’t be disappointed that you had a blank five times in a row! You can get one or more lower-grade items unconditionally.)<br/><br/>There was a bonus for five consecutive blanks. It seemed a trick to have the clients to spend more money by alleviating their shock of successive failures. Although the bonus was guaranteed, it didn’t seem to be an attractive merit because the bonus was only a ‘low-level item’.<br/><br/>So, what they got was a ‘potion set’. It wasn’t that valuable, given that Junghoo left behind a box of potions when he met Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Tidididididididi<br/><br/>For the sixth time, Sungwoo aimed at the odds of winning 600,000 gold.<br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/>The slots slowed down and a picture of a necklace in the first row appeared. Then another necklace in the second row and another one in the third came up.<br/><br/>– Congratulations! You have won a rare item!<br/><br/>“Well, it’s a third-class product at best.”<br/><br/>He didn’t know whether he should take it as a gain. He accepted the item falling from the air.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Spartan Warrior’s Necklace<br/><br/>-Grade: Rare<br/><br/>-Category: Necklace<br/><br/>-Effect: Stamina increases (+2)<br/><br/>“Not bad.”<br/><br/>However, Sungwo could not be satisfied with it. Feeling he was lacking a lot, he played slots again.<br/><br/>However, what he got next was No. 3 which was a blank, a “potion set” and a “charger (medium)”. He felt the return on his investment of 1 million gold was rather shabby.<br/><br/>‘I’ve collected only eight tokens.’<br/><br/>When he looked at Hanho and Jisu on the side, they also looked very miserable.<br/><br/>‘Let’s keep doing it until we collect ten tokens.’<br/><br/>Strangely enough, he drew a blank twice in a row.<br/><br/>-Blank!<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh! First place!”<br/><br/>It was Hanho who hit the jackpot first. Hanho raised his hands in tears.<br/><br/>“It’s the second time I won the first place in my life!”<br/><br/>“Really? What was the first one?”<br/><br/>“Oh, I got first place in the chopsticks-throwing game.”<br/><br/>“What the heck?”<br/><br/>Hanho did not answer, then received a piece of parchment that fell from the air.<br/><br/>“1st place? I won first place, too. By the way, what is it?”<br/><br/>Picking up the parchment paper, Hanho’s face gradually stiffened.<br/><br/>“Hey, what is it?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Goddess of Luck’s Prank (Magic Scroll)<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: Consumption<br/><br/>-Effect: When using it, you can show a random skill. (Failure probability 50%, lower skill probability 40%, advanced skill probability 7%, superior skill probability 2%, desired skill selection 1%)<br/><br/>“Ah…”<br/><br/>It was something weird for a legendary item.<br/><br/>Sungwoo left behind Hanho who was dejected by the 1st place item, and used all 10 tokens to maximize the picture of the first prize. He thought this was actually his last chance.<br/><br/>Clank!<br/><br/>He lowered the lever and the pictures started to stop.<br/><br/>Tididididididididi-<br/><br/>Something like a ring appeared in the first row. And the same picture appeared one after another. However, he couldn’t figure out what kind of item he would receive by looking at the painting alone.<br/><br/>– Congratulations! You won the first prize!<br/><br/>“Great!”<br/><br/>He hit the jackpot finally.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Shadow King’s Ring<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: Ring<br/><br/>-Effect: Increases Agility (+3), Increases Stamina (+2), When you attack the opponent in a shadow, a ‘Shadow Alter Ego’ is summoned to help you attack. (The alter ego takes 50% damage.)<br/><br/>The moment Sungwoo thought he broke even by investing 1 million gold, another message appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/>[Special Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: Heir to the Shadow King<br/><br/>-Type: Collection<br/><br/>-Goal: Collect all the Shadow King’s relics<br/><br/>-Reward: Shadow King’s Crown<br/><br/>“Quest?”<br/><br/>Come to think of it, the robe he was wearing now was also the robe of the Shadow King.<br/><br/>It seemed that he was given the quest by having two items with the same modifier.<br/><br/>‘I think I have to collect set items.’<br/><br/>Unless there was a way for him to obtain the set items at the store, it seemed that he could get them only with the extreme probability.<br/><br/>Jisu played slots well this time. Using 130,000 gold, she obtained a hero-grade item called ‘Wind Spirit’s Bracelet’. It would increase her agility level by 4 when she wore it.<br/><br/>After returning to the village, they dispatched a monster crackdown team to protect the store located in Suwon Station.<br/><br/>Kyongsu said he would come up with a plan to effectively protect the store by systematically organizing the mission of the crackdown team.<br/><br/>“Since you are leaving tomorrow, I need to think more clearly about the deployment of the crackdown team because we shouldn’t have any problem even when we are alone.”<br/><br/>“Okay, then. I’m leaving for the operation tomorrow. Let me trust you, Kyongsu, while I’m away.”<br/><br/>The planned boss raid in Youido was supposed to begin tomorrow.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Sungwoo packed his bag in preparation for the raid. His preparation sounded like a light job, but filling the bags of the seventeen human beast skeletons with potions and bones took quite a bit of time.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo! Sungwoo!”<br/><br/>Hangho rushed in, calling his name. His urgent call meant something unusual happened to the community.<br/><br/>“Look at this! Number 7!”<br/><br/>━ Player Guidebook<br/><br/>[1.

However, there was nothing particular in the broadcast. It was off the air soon. It was literally a trial broadcast.<br/><br/>‘Are they going to film their boss raid process?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo could understand their photographer would take pictures of the raid, but what was the motivation behind Junghoo getting the boss raid broadcasted live?<br/><br/>‘I can dismiss his intention as bad thoughtlessly, but he definitely intends to lead public opinion.’<br/><br/>Furthermore, there was a big commotion within the community after Sungwoo advanced to No. 2 in the players’ rankings. Because of this, there was a heated war of nerves between those who opposed the Youngdungpo Prosecutor and those following him.<br/><br/>‘Junghoon can’t help but be conscious of this unusual movement in the community.’<br/><br/>In Sungwoo’s opinion, Junghoon was not a bad man, but his ambition could always lead him to make a wrong choice.<br/><br/>‘You have no other choice but to keep me at bay,’ Sungwoo thought.<br/><br/>Although Sungwoo didn’t have the same ambition as Junghoon, he unwittingly came to stand in the way of the latter’s ambition. Maybe that’s why Junghoo was now trying to hold him in check.<br/><br/>‘For example, he might be trying his best to hand me as small of a reward as possible.’<br/><br/>That was why Sungwoo kept the ‘Vow of Oath’ item in the Hidden Stage. It was an item that would prove invaluable someday.<br/><br/>The next day, a helicopter arrived from Youngdungpo.<br/><br/>Doodoodooo!<br/><br/>A man wearing glasses got off the helicopter.<br/><br/>“Hello. My name is Minhum Sung, the deputy of the Crusader Team. I’ve flown here to escort you. Please get aboard the helicopter.”<br/><br/>Junghoon did not come in person this time, so he sent his deputy commander, an indication that he was still paying special attention to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo got aboard the helicopter, guided by Minhum, everyone on the helicopter looked into the air.<br/><br/>[Group Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: What do the hero and a star have in common?<br/><br/>-Type: Competition<br/><br/>-Goal: Raid Boss ‘Single Kill’<br/><br/>-Reward: Special item<br/><br/>Multiple groups are gathering for this raid.

                            “Uh? Do you see this?” Minhum asked.<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded at him.<br/><br/>Again, someone who had been watching this place upgraded the level of difficulty in the boss raid.<br/><br/>‘As things stand now, I have no choice but to compete with the Youngdungpo Prosecutor.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo had no intention of backing down.<br/><br/>The Youido Boss Raid was splashed in headlines across the community bulletin.<br/><br/>[67] I announce the start of Yeouido Boss Raid.<br/><br/>-Author: Youngdungpo Prosecutor │ Hit: 857,466<br/><br/><br/><br/>「Comments: 244」<br/><br/>Since the Liberation Guild publicized the boss raid intensively for the past several days, hundreds of comments were being posted one after the other even though his announcement itself was posted only a little while ago.<br/><br/>In particular, they paid a lot of attention to the fact that they could watch the fighting broadcasted live. When it was announced that a new quest was given to the raid participants, they made a fuss over it.<br/><br/>‘I now see why there was a trial broadcast…’<br/><br/>The reason they tested it last night was also because of this live broadcast. Sungwoo felt a little upset about this.<br/><br/>“We’re going to land soon!”<br/><br/>A firefighting helicopter carrying Sungwoo’s party arrived over Youngdungpo Station.<br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/>Sungwoo had an entire view of the station. A defensive position was built on the rooftop, and dozens of guards were on standby there. Giant fixed catapults were aimed in all directions.<br/><br/>The streets in front of the station were neatly cleaned, and fences were installed in all directions. The letter “H” was painted in the middle of it. It was the helicopter landing site.<br/><br/>Woooong!<br/><br/>Soon, the helicopter landed and a group of people quickly came out of the station. They were the players participating in this raid including Junghoon and the Crusader Team.<br/><br/>As expected, Junghoon, wearing white plate armor, stepped forward. Walking behind him, the photographer worked hard to take pictures.<br/><br/>Click! Click!<br/><br/>“Welcome to the Liberation Guild. Thanks for your long journey to this place.”<br/><br/>“I see you have cleaned up the surrounding area well.”<br/><br/>“Haha. Yeah, they’ve been cleaned up recently.”<br/><br/>While the two shook hands, both parties looked at each other. However, given the images of them taken in the camera, there was a big difference in their gravity.<br/><br/>Those standing behind Junghoon were a few dozens of men wearing armor, whereas Sungwoo and his three friends were lightly armed. Sungwoo suspected that Junghoon mobilized his men with this kind of contrast in their gravity in mind.<br/><br/>‘You don’t have to get your men to come out in droves like this.’<br/><br/>With the live broadcast ready, Jungwoo must have thought of maximizing the effects of meeting Sungwoo and his friends.<br/><br/>Click! Click!<br/><br/>The photographer took pictures of the two leaders’ every action.<br/><br/>“By the way, I wonder why he has only three men for this raid.”<br/><br/>Someone standing behind Junghoon mumbled. Everyone’s eyes turned to him.<br/><br/>The guy who said this was a young man with a piercing, gray hair, and a Gucci brand red bucket hat. Scratching at the sides of his face with a long wooden cane, he made a dissatisfied expression.<br/><br/>“I was hoping that a large group of survivors would come out from Suwon, but they are only three? I don’t think this is a profitable alliance. We are 31, all told, and these guys from Kangnam area are 102 in total.”<br/><br/>Having said that, he glanced at Junghoon. But he didn’t seem to check Junghoo’s expression, but to exchange some sort of eye signal with him.<br/><br/>‘What the heck? This might be their trick, too.’<br/><br/>It was a huge alliance for the raid, but Sungwoo felt like he was standing in the middle of the enemy camp.<br/><br/>This is definitely Junghoon’s headquarters. Except for Hanho and Jisoo, all of them are Junghoon’s forces. In other words, Sungwoo was now in a completely different situation from when Junghoon visited Suwon, his main base.<br/><br/>‘Well, the terms of the contract have not been finalized yet. He may want to set forth the conditions more advantageous to him by pushing me like this.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo stared at Junghoon silently.<br/><br/>“Excuse, but can you introduce him to me?”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo asked, Junghoon nodded, smiling awkwardly as if he didn’t expect this kind of situation.<br/><br/>“Ah, this is Kangyun Lee, who leads a group of survivors in Daehak St. Kangyun, I think you know Sungwoo already…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded and looked at Kangyun.<br/><br/>‘He is one of the named guys in the community. His ID is Kangyun, wizard of the flame series.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought it was good that he checked out the community before coming here. Kangyun was a player who was more active in community activities than anyone else. He was an addict who spent more than 30,000 gold in the community.<br/><br/>Given that he was sticking to his fashion sense even in this kind of world, he was obviously a very stubborn guy.<br/><br/>Sungwoo opened his mouth, “Have you been dispatched here?”<br/><br/>“I beg your pardon?”<br/><br/>“Well, I think I’ve been disappointed in the number of our members here. We have always moved around and acted together. We’re not here to support anybody else as an auxiliary force. We are here to participate in the raid by ourselves.”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo hung tough, Junghoo quickly came out as a moderator.<br/><br/>“Come on, Kangyun, that’s enough. Sungwoo is not alone here. There is a reason why I have made special efforts to invite him to participate in this raid. His ranking verifies his value.”<br/><br/>However, Kangyun did not relent and continued, “If that’s the case, how are you going to distribute the rewards? We’re fighting at the risk of our lives. I don’t think he deserves the same rewards as us.”<br/><br/>Since a tremendous reward would be given for this raid, everybody was very sensitive to how Junghoon would distribute it.<br/><br/>“Why do you think you deserve the same rewards? This is not a communist society.”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“I want you to show me why you should take more rewards than me. I feel a bit dizzy after coming here on a helicopter. Can I go in?”<br/><br/>“Of course. We can’t stay here like this. Now, let’s go in.”<br/><br/>The alliance members ahead of the raid were never friendly to each other. Sungwoo couldn’t help it. There were more people who put their interests before the great cause of killing the monster in Youido, and that was the same case with Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Before the raid, Junghoon gathered the leaders of each group to discuss the issue of rewards distribution, and a dozen sat around at the conference hall of Youngdungpo Station.<br/><br/>“Although we are not sure if we can succeed in the boss raid operation, we still have to deal with how to distribute the rewards first. I thought we needed to make a clear decision on this issue. We invited someone who could iron out our differences excellently. He is also very knowledgeable in the field.”<br/><br/>Someone stood up at Junghoon’s introduction. He was the man wearing glasses who had come to Suwon to escort Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Hi, my name is Minhum Sung, and I’m the deputy commander of the Crusader Team. It’s nice to meet you.”<br/><br/>Then, he began to explain about the distribution standards of rewards that the Liberation Guild had set on its own. Most of what he explained focused on the ‘fair distribution’ that Kangyun mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>“As all of you already checked, this raid was given a quest.”<br/><br/>He explained that the boss would not suffer damage from multiple attacks, and a great reward would be given to the man who killed the boss in a one-on-one fight.<br/><br/>“I don’t know which item will come out as a reward, but I will convert the price of the item into gold and divide it by twelve for fair distribution.”<br/><br/>At that point, Sungwoo flinched and thought about it.<br/><br/>‘Dividing the reward evenly means it’s fair. I wonder why nobody here is raising any objection.’<br/><br/>Everyone just nodded, but they seemed to be concerned about Sungwoo’s reaction.<br/><br/>The bald man sitting in front of Sungwoo also glanced at him a moment ago.<br/><br/>‘These guys are all in it together.’<br/><br/>In fact, all of them were members of the Liberation Guild. Accordingly, if they evenly divide the rewards by 12, 11 of them will receive the reward. Regardless of Sungwoo’s claim to the reward, his share will be extremely small.<br/><br/>After the briefing, Minhum looked at Sungwoo and asked, “Do you have any other opinions?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo raised his hand. Minhum nodded as if he was expecting his question. </div><h2 id="chapter90">Chapter 90</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “Please go ahead.”<br/><br/>“This is a fight that requires a one-on-one confrontation with the boss. Why should you share the reward? Isn’t it only natural that the reward should go to the person who wins the fight at the risk of his life?”<br/><br/>“Uh, I understand you have suggested this idea first for the sake of fairness…”<br/><br/>“Yes, I mentioned fair, not equal, distribution. Each of us will deal with the monster with different levels, but do we receive the equal reward, apart from that? That would be really…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at Junghoon and smiled gently.<br/><br/>“Oh, this is no fun. Do you need Carrie? Is that why you called me to make me your zzol follower?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo asked provocatively on purpose.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Pushed to third place by Sungwoo in the players’ rankings, Junghoon seemed uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Then, Junghoon’s supporters began to make lousy complaints.<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“What the heck is that guy talking about? Did he mention something like zzol?”<br/><br/>Carrie or zzol referred to the high-level user’s helping a low-level user in MMORPG games, and the highest level among them was not Junghoon, but Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Hey, Necromancer. If you’re so good, why don’t you come out and have a PVP(player versus player) game with me?”<br/><br/>The bald man sitting in front of Sungwoo stood up. Sungwoo once heard about him in the community.<br/><br/>His name was Ansok Ku, who was a player from Inchon, and a self-proclaimed “Kwon Wang” with his community ID “Kwon Wang”. Ranked 11th, he was famous for the way he fought large boss monsters.<br/><br/>“Huh? Why don’t you reply?”<br/><br/>“Please sit down first. It’s dazzling because the fluorescent light is reflected on your head.”<br/><br/>“What did you say? Damn it…”<br/><br/>“Don’t you get it? I think that’s why he sent me a helicopter and escorted me here.”<br/><br/>“You, son of a bitch!”<br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/>Someone hit the desk hard.<br/><br/>Seated at the top table, Junghoon struck the table with his fist.<br/><br/>Everyone was silent.<br/><br/>“Sure, no problem.”<br/><br/>Obviously, Junghoon’s gaze turned into something ferocious. It was not gentle anymore. It was the raw expression of the Crusader leader, full of confidence and triumph.<br/><br/>“I think it will be more fun if we accept your suggestion.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s provocations worked. Junghoon had been regarding Sungwoo as a rival for a long time, and Sungwoo’s provocations this time triggered his competitive spirit.<br/><br/>Sungwoo decided to save the contract for a bigger cause.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Like they did always, the Crusaders Team dispatched a search team before starting the boss hunt. Sungwoo heard that three days ago, ten crew members were sent to search for the boss in Youido, and only two of them returned alive. But thanks to that, they knew what the raid target was.<br/><br/>“As you know from the quest, the enemies are called Lizardmaen’. Since they appeared, Yeouido has been turning into a wetland,” Junghoon said to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>It was impossible to explain, but water was stagnating, and bushes were growing all over Youido. Swamps began to grow here and there.<br/><br/>“In short, Youido is changing into a good environment for Lizardmen to live. This is tragic news, but the problem is not just the appearance of the monsters. The bigger problem is this world is becoming the land of monsters.”<br/><br/>If Junghoon’s line of reasoning was true, it’s obviously a problem that everybody should be concerned about. Youido was currently turning into a wetland only because its main inhabitants were Lizardmen, but if more bizarre monsters appeared, Youido could change into a place where humans could not live anymore in the future.<br/><br/>“No matter what, the Korean peninsula will be over unless we stop the corrupters. You remember the ‘bad ending’, right?”<br/><br/>“But do you know who the corruptor is?”<br/><br/>Junghoon shook his head. His confidence and vibrant spirit could be no longer found on his face. As usual, he kindly explained, “I don’t know what this corruptor is. I don’t know whether it is a monster or a player. That’s why we have no choice but to occupy and protect Youido, where the world tree is growing.”<br/><br/>“I see,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Junghoon looked at him and said, “Take care of yourself. I started this operation because of my burning desire to challenge you, but the most important thing is for us to survive.”<br/><br/>“Of course.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was still doubting Junghoon’s sincerity. He was always kind, and talked about a great cause, but at the end of the day, he was trying to change the game more in his favor cunningly.<br/><br/>‘He’s not wrong, but I can’t tolerate it.’<br/><br/>It was a competition, if not a fight between them. So, one has to win the competition by beating the other one.<br/><br/>“Our operation will begin in ten minutes. See you in the boss room at Youido Park.”<br/><br/>Junghoon disappeared after saying that.<br/><br/>“Okay, let’s get ready to fight,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Jisu and Hanho stood behind him.<br/><br/>“Yeah. We’re ready.”<br/><br/>“By the way, is it true we look so shabby? I saw the photos of us three uploaded on the community bulletin. They didn’t look good. Well, we will look better soon,” said Hanho.<br/><br/>The first operation of the raid was a ‘simultaneous strike’. Since the Lizardman tribe was in control of the entire Youido area, Junghoon’s forces would surround and close in on the southern tributary of the Han River and destroy them.<br/><br/>This kind of operation was nothing but a reckless armed conflict. The operation was entirely in favor of the Crusader Team who were armed with thick armor and shields, while receiving all sorts of synergy.<br/><br/>‘All-out attack? Not bad.’<br/><br/>This operation was also advantageous for the Necromancer. The attributes of the two leaders were mutually exclusive, but there was something they had in common.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/>A Lizardman’s head was broken with a terrifying noise. Then, the body of a reptile over 2 meters long was lifted up and fell vertically over the manhole lid.<br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/>Ansok Ku, who succeeded in taking down the monster, stopped, while trying to deal a fatal blow.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>The Lizardman was killed with his head broken, and a message appeared before his eyes that he obtained 3,800 gold. Several Lizardmen, killed with their heads and back crushed, were strewn here and here.<br/><br/>“Hahaha! Is that all there is to that? Any more Lizardman? Huh?”<br/><br/>His team just broke through “Seoul Bridge” and landed in Youido. Thanks to his tremendous defense and breakthrough, his team advanced to Youido quickly without incurring any big sacrifice.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuh!<br/><br/>However, the intersections in front of Youido had a pool of water with hollow asphalt holes here and there. The reeds grew in them, turning them into swamps. Dozens of Lizardmen began to crawl out of the swamps.<br/><br/>“Hahaha!”<br/><br/>However, looking ahead, Ansok laughed heartily, bumping his fists against each other.<br/><br/>“Good! Come on, guys!”<br/><br/>The guy dressed up in luxury items, Kangyun stood behind him and said, “Brother! Can you protect yourself? If you are killed here, we’re in big danger!”<br/><br/>As a wizard of the flames series, Kangyun frowned, feeling the dense moisture while approaching Youido.<br/><br/>“Damn it, it’s a wetland… I can’t do anything because I can’t make a fire.”<br/><br/>Normally, he could bring out the most intense flames against a large number of monsters, but Youido, which was turning into a wetland, was indeed the worst environment for him to use his magic.<br/><br/>“Hey, Kangyun, you just sit back and broadcast our fighting. I guess I have to yield to our leader, but honestly speaking, I’m coveting the winner’s place. How about calling me Lizardman Warrior? I think I can fight very well if I confront these monsters by myself.”<br/><br/>Kangyun shook his head, though. In fact, he was watching a live raid broadcast, holding a smartphone in one hand.<br/><br/>“Please give up. Brother Junghoon has already arrived at Yeouido ahead of you. He has already advanced to the Lizardmen village area.”<br/><br/>“Damn it! The Crusader Team is really overwhelming! I’ve never seen any monster block that team. Hahaha! As expected, our leader is really cool!”<br/><br/>Although Ansok rushed recklessly, he admitted that his team was no match for the Crusader Team led by Junghoon.<br/><br/>“At first, I thought this guy, Youngdungpo Prosecutor, was a phony business man paying lip service, but I now admit this guy is really a man among men!”<br/><br/>Ansok remembered that a team of 20 Crusaders collided head-on with more than two hundred Orcs and beat all of them in just three minutes.<br/><br/>After witnessing that spectacular scene, Ansok voluntarily joined Junghoon’s group without any objection.<br/><br/>Du Du Du-Woo Woo-woong-<br/><br/>At that moment, a fire helicopter passed over his head.<br/><br/>“The cameramen are busy broadcasting the raid. Uh, where are you heading now? Our leader is fighting over there.”<br/><br/>“Damn it, brother?”<br/><br/>Kangyun’s expression grew dark when he was watching the live broadcast from the helicopter.<br/><br/>“Uh? What’s the problem?”<br/><br/>“Necromancer…”<br/><br/>When he said that, Ansok reacted cynically.<br/><br/>“Why? Why? Was that guy killed? Man, I knew he would be when I saw him being so gallant!”<br/><br/>“No, that’s not what happened…” Kangyun shook his head. “He has already entered Youido Park.”<br/><br/>“Youido Park? Isn’t it the place where the boss room is?”<br/><br/>“Right. He’s already there ahead of brother Junghoon.”<br/><br/>The reason why Ansok regarded the Crusader Team’s fighting as the best was because he had never seen the Necromancer fighting on the battlefield. </div><h2 id="chapter91">Chapter 91</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Myongsu Yang, Level 11 with the “iron armored archer” job, was assigned to Youi Bridge, along with the Necromancer.<br/><br/>He participated in the raid with a total of 13 team members, and all of them, armed with long-range weapons, were enjoying a synergy effect for ‘rear support shooting’.<br/><br/>In other words, they could not carry out the operation as a single team, so they were evaluated as the weakest among the teams participating in the raid. However, even if they were a weak team, they were smart enough to grasp what was going on.<br/><br/>‘This means that since our team is the weakest, we have to stand in the way of the Necromancer.”<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, 30 minutes before the start of the operation, Minhum Sung, the deputy commander of the Crusader Team, approached him and said, “Team manager.”<br/><br/>“…Yes?”<br/><br/>“Don’t overwork yourself today.”<br/><br/>As soon as he said that, Minhum disappeared. What he wanted to say was clear. He wanted Sungwoo’s attack delayed.<br/><br/>‘It’s clear that Junghoon, the guild master, is also holding me in check. Given his personality, he would not have openly ordered his men to check me, but this kind of message by his deputy Minhum means his whole team wants to stop me from advancing.’<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>On the surface, their boss raid looked like a coordinated operation, but in reality it was like a competition between the Crusader Team and the Necromancer over the No. 2 place in the players’ rankings.<br/><br/>‘It’s a game where the Necromancer like me has no choice but to lose because all the eleven teams participating in the raid support the guild master.’<br/><br/>After the raid began, however, Myongsu couldn’t believe what’s happening before his eyes.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuh!<br/><br/>They first encountered twelve Lizardmen. While guarding the entrance to Youi Bridge, they pulled out wide swords and approached as soon as they found humans.<br/><br/>-Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in the affected area!<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>At that moment, black smoke spread and 17 skeletons popped out. In addition, ten zombies crawled out of the black mud and joined the skeletons.<br/><br/>Kieeeeh! Kieeeek!<br/><br/>The swarm of Lizardmen were instantly slaughtered without any resistance by their surprise attack amid the black smoke.<br/><br/>‘Nonsense! Even one Lizardman is as strong as a Werewolf-class monster. How can they kill it so easily? Wait a minute. Look at that bone! It looks like a Werebear. Is that a Weretiger?’<br/><br/>What happened next was more bizarre in Myongsu’s eyes. After the bones were separated from the Lizardmen’s corpses, they began to stick to the skeletons and zombies’ bodies.<br/><br/>‘Heavy armored zombies?’<br/><br/>The pile of bones became ‘full plate armor’ for the zombies.<br/><br/>At the same time, a certain message appeared before Myongsus eyes.<br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/>5) Ironclad Knights (Stage 3)<br/><br/>-Category: Armor synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: Install at least 30 ‘Full Plate Armor’<br/><br/>-Effect: Increases armor defense power (+20%) and forms a shield equivalent to 30% of defense power.<br/><br/>The same information message came out because they were in sync with Sungwoo.<br/><br/>‘Isn’t it the synergy of the Crusader Team? How can they get this advanced synergy so easily? I can’t believe this!”<br/><br/>Of course, Myongsu did not know the synergy of the Crusader Team.<br/><br/>The protective shields they were wearing were further strengthened by Junghoon’s exclusive skill, but at first glance it looked similar.<br/><br/>“Would you like some armor, too?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/>“Ah, we are archers, so we should wear it lightly…”<br/><br/>“The armor I make is lighter than you think.”<br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo almost forcibly put the bone armor on Myongsu’s archers.<br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/>5) Ironclad Knights (Stage 4)<br/><br/>-Category: Armor synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: At least 40 ‘Full Plate Armor’<br/><br/>-Effect: Increases armor defense power (+25%) and forms a shield equivalent to 35% of defense power.<br/><br/>‘Damn it! He wants something like a synergy shuttle, but it is definitely lighter than metal armor. This is a total scam.’<br/><br/>The heavy-armored undead army, who received such tremendous synergy, rushed toward twenty Lizardmen.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>‘But the leather hides of these Lizardmen are like armor. If we fight these Lizardmen in the swamps, we might be put on the defensive. This Necromancer doesn’t know that.’<br/><br/>Lizardmen’s leather was very thick and tough, so sharp weapons could not penetrate them well.<br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/>As expected, even though Myongsu’s team fired a barrage of arrows, they couldn’t get their intended results.<br/><br/>“God damn it! We can’t penetrate them with these arrows. It’s successful if just one out of five arrows strike at the target.”<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“So, fire as many arrows as possible! Anyway the Necromancer will protect us anyway.”<br/><br/>Myongsu’s team was firing arrows from the rear, but they couldn’t do much damage to the Lizardmen because they had invested a lot in synergy.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was different. He was striking them down one by one.<br/><br/>“Uh? Wait a minute. What the heck is this? Sungwoo keeps destroying them quickly!”<br/><br/>Just like he dealt with Giant Troll before, Sungwoo could pierce a hole in the tough leather of the Lizardmen through the synergy effect of ‘penetration’ that was triggered when he carried a long spear with his armor.<br/><br/>“Where did he obtain that spear all of a sudden?” Myongsu asked.<br/><br/>“That’s what I’m wondering now. He had nothing in his hand until just now. It looks like he made it just like he made the bone armor before.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo could do it because he could change the synergy anytime by using the bones in the backpack.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>The beast skeletons pushed the Lizardmen by using their hard bodies then stabbed them recklessly, holding the long spears horizontally.<br/><br/>Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk!<br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately got rid of all the Lizardmen standing in his way like a bulldozer.<br/><br/>The zombies with blunt instruments made of bones came up right behind him and struck down the heads of the fallen Lizardmen.<br/><br/>Simply pushing the opponent with overwhelming power was actually the most efficient hunting method. Moreover, even the two players on Sungwoo’s team were fighting bravely.<br/><br/>Whenever a swarm of Lizardmen appeared, the female samurai in the red sweatshirt jumped through them, which was very dangerous, but she moved through them adroitly as if she was flying across a tightrope and wielded her sword violently.<br/><br/>Whenever she cut their skin with the sharp blade, a spark occurred causing fatal damage to their skin. It was not just simple damage, but a tremendous pain that the Lizardmen, cold-blooded animals, could never get used to.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuh! Kueeeek!<br/><br/>When the Lizardman fell down, the skeletons immediately smashed them in an instant.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Hanho, who wore a poncho like a male thief, was fighting among the skeletons.<br/><br/>His dagger hit the Lizardmen’s relatively weak areas such as eyes or between the eyebrows.<br/><br/>On such occasions, a shield was added, so his body was wrapped with a double shield<br/><br/>Thus, even if the Lizardmen attacked him head on, they couldn’t penetrate the shield.<br/><br/>“Hahaha! I am a thief who can neutralize your attack!”<br/><br/>Myongsu’s team members could not believe the amazing fighting of the Necromancer’s team composed of only three members.<br/><br/>“The skeletons keep on moving. Whew! I’m getting tired now. Our team members also complain that they can hardly move because their shoes are filled with water.”<br/><br/>“We can’t help it. If we fall apart in front of the Necromancer, we all die. So, you have to get close to him, thinking it as if you are now on a tough military march.”<br/><br/>Normally, general players could not move fast when water came in their shoes and their clothes got wet, but the skeletons didn’t have to worry about that. Since their body had holes everywhere, they had no problem moving at all even in the wetlands.<br/><br/>Therefore, Sungwoo’s team moved on through the wetlands and advanced faster than anyone else toward Youido Park, where the boss monster stayed.<br/><br/>“Hey, Necromancer! Wait a minute!”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“The place you see in front is Youido Station. After you pass that, you are there in Youido Park!”<br/><br/>The place where Myongsu pointed to was Uisadang Street, an intersection of eight lanes as well as a place where Metro Line 9 and 5 passed at the same time. This place was transformed into a wetland completely.<br/><br/>There were lots of reeds and aquatic plants growing taller than humans. Furthermore, the vines that climbed the traffic lights and street trees hung long branches on the ground everywhere.<br/><br/>“I guess there are a lot of Lizardmen hiding for ambush. That’s why we didn’t bring spears here.”<br/><br/>Everyone knew that the spear was useful in penetrating the thick leather of the Lizardmen.<br/><br/>However, because the wetland was an environment where they had to advance by walking on the water and breaking through the bushes, they had to avoid any weapons that could stand in their way.<br/><br/>‘No matter how well the Necromancer is fighting, this is an impossible place to fight.’<br/><br/>Myongsu thought that this time the Necromancer would have a hard time. The Necromancer would get blinded by the bushes, and it was clear that the skeletons could not escape the Lizardmen’s reckless attacks.<br/><br/>“Even if the water is shallow enough to touch your thighs, the Lizardman can hide under the water. So, be careful,” said Myongsu.<br/><br/>“I see,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>“This is the fastest way, but the most dangerous. Why don’t you wait until the team crossing the Cultural Bridge arrives and join them?” Myongsu suggested.<br/><br/>“I don’t think it is necessary.” Sungwoo gently declined.<br/><br/>At that moment, the skeletons carried something on their back.<br/><br/>They were Lizardmen’s bodies.<br/><br/>“What are you going to do now?”<br/><br/>“I’m going to make the way to the park.”<br/><br/>The skeletons pushed the bodies near the area where the reeds became thick. The moment when the bodies of the five Lizardmen were placed safely on the edge of the reed field, there was the sound of an explosion.<br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/>Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!<br/><br/>  </div><h2 id="chapter92">Chapter 92</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>With a tremendous explosion, many parts of the reed field were ripped and torn away, and sprays of water splashed in all directions.<br/><br/>Myongsu raised his hand and blocked the sprays of water flying into his face. Then, he looked straight ahead with a ghostly expression.<br/><br/>Kuguguguuuu―<br/><br/>Then, the corpses of Lizardmen rose over the surface of the wetland one by one.<br/><br/>Like Myongsu said, they were lurking under the water for ambush.<br/><br/>“They were really hiding for a surprise attack!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo repeated triggering the Corpse Explosion. His tactic was simple, but quite effective, compared with a reckless attack.<br/><br/>Just like a vicious poacher who illegally developed the Amazon jungle, Sungwoo began to smash the wetlands near Youido Station without blinking an eye.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>-You earned 3,800 gold by hunting Lizardman.<br/><br/>-You earned 3,800 gold by hunting Lizardman.<br/><br/>-You earned 3,800 gold by hunting Lizardman.<br/><br/>A good message kept appearing before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/>“Hanho, the subway is right under your feet. Have you ever thought that you might fall into it because the roads are filled with holes everywhere?”<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, what the hell are you talking about?”<br/><br/>But Hanho relented and held the forearm of the Werebear skeleton when he moved on.<br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/>At that moment, a fire helicopter, which was constantly floating in the western sky, turned its direction toward Youido Park as if to check out Sungwoo’s fighting. The cameramen began to shoot the scenes of Sungwoo and Myongsu team’s activities.<br/><br/>Myongsu’s team were quite embarrassed by the appearance of the helicopter.<br/><br/>“Uh? They are filming us.”<br/><br/>“They are supposed to film our leader Junghoon’s great fighting.”<br/><br/>But the “camera operator” on the helicopter was formerly a cinematographer, so he knew well what he had to focus on.<br/><br/>So, when Sungwoo’s brilliant fighting began to stand out, he asked the pilot to turn the helicopter in the direction of Youido Park. His professionalism was working at the moment.<br/><br/>He lifted up a broadcast camera and filmed the skeleton army.<br/><br/>‘I’ve got to shoot the heavily armed skeletons and the massive explosions right now. This is the scene that the Youngdungpo Prosecutor mentioned, which could lift the morale of all the survivors. It’s my job to convey this footage.”<br/><br/>In fact, he had been asked by the deputy of the Crusader Team to shoot the scenes of the Crusaders Team as much as possible, but he told the deputy that he would film other teams’ activities on and off. When he said that, the deputy accepted his suggestion unexpectedly.<br/><br/>“Good. If there is a delay in our team’s advance, you can shoot the scene of other teams’ activities. I think that’s good for our viewers.”<br/><br/>The deputy commander seemed to have judged that such scenes would make the performance of the Crusader Team stand out more prominently, compared with other teams.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, it was the opposite situation now.<br/><br/>[Real time chatting]<br/><br/>─ Let’s survive: Thanks for your hard work. You guys are really cool, fighting at the risk of your lives when we are busy escaping to survive day by day.<br/><br/>─ State exam preparer: These guys are real heroes. It’s really cool to see them advancing from all directions. I recognize their brilliant performance.<br/><br/>─ Pyeongtaek fighter: Great, film director! It would be more fun if you showed other teams.<br/><br/>─ Mihyong Lee 33: Oh? He is the Necromancer!<br/><br/>─ Hyunju Kang: Finally Necromancer!!!<br/><br/>─ Ulsan Kangjun: Is that ID157? Wow, he’s a real fighter!<br/><br/>─ 50-year-old Chuljun Park: We are seeing another hero now. Youngdungpo Prosecutor is great, but I’m looking forward to this man’s activities.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, the real-time chatters, who occupied one side of the broadcast screen, had gotten involved in more heated discussion.<br/><br/>[Real time chat]<br/><br/>─ Ulsan Kangjun: Jackpot lol<br/><br/>─ Hyunjun Noh: How wonderful! You guys are great, Crusaders!<br/><br/>─ Noryangjin Prosecutor: They’re no match for the Necromancer. He’s just smashed the whole wetland and the Lizardmen’s forces turned into chaos.<br/><br/>─ Hyonju Kang: This is the very best of the Necromancer!<br/><br/>─ Gotham Incheon: Yeah, this is the real battle of extreme efficiency.<br/><br/>─ Gunsan Uncle: From my point of view…Necro…he is one cut above that prosecutor guy. Don’t serve that prosecutor<br/><br/>The performance of the Crusader Team, armed with full plate armor, was also spectacular.<br/><br/>However, in the case of Sungwoo’s forces, the skeletons were fully armed. Besides, Sungwoo had the powerful triggering magic of Corpse Explosion, so this was more stimulating from the perspective of the viewers.<br/><br/>The camera operator took a close-up of Sungwoo’s face unwittingly, who was the protagonist of this magnificent scene.<br/><br/>“Wonderful, wonderful.”<br/><br/>Wearing a dark green robe, equipped with bone armor, Sungwoo stood tall behind the undead army and commanded them in every situation. He reached out to trigger an explosion, then turned his head to get the skeletons moving on.<br/><br/>Then, he slowly stepped forward on the road that he forcibly opened. The huge skeleton warriors followed him at his sides.<br/><br/>Indeed, Sungwoo looked like the commander on the battlefield.<br/><br/>“Director!”<br/><br/>At that moment, the assistant cameraman sitting next to him tapped him on the shoulder.<br/><br/>With an embarrassing expression, he pointed to the ‘walkie-talkie’ in his hand.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“I have a call!”<br/><br/>It was a very valuable item, and as the name suggests, it was an item that allowed for short-distance communication in a situation where all the communication equipment on Earth had been interrupted.<br/><br/>The camera director handed over the camera to the assistant and took the walkie-talkie.<br/><br/>“Yes, I got it. Just tell me.”<br/><br/>– Crackle! Crackle! Director! Director!<br/><br/>It was the voice of the deputy commander Minhum Sung.<br/><br/>“Pardon? Deputy, what did you say?”<br/><br/>-Damn it! What the heck are you filming now? Crackle…turn the camera angle in the opposite direction right away!<br/><br/>“But you said I could shoot the scenes of other teams’ activities…”<br/><br/>-Hey, are you asking me because you don’t understand what I said then? I’ll kill you if you don’t turn the camera angle right now. Got it? Crackle…<br/><br/>There was no kind or considerate tone in his voice anymore regarding the survivors.<br/><br/>“I’m sorry! Let me turn right away! Captain, please turn the camera angle to the west again!”<br/><br/>Woooooooong-<br/><br/>With the helicopter turning back, Sungwoo disappeared out of the camera angle.<br/><br/>But the real-time comments were filled with the viewers’ angry sentiment because the cameraman turned the camera angle at an important moment.<br/><br/>However, the camera operator could not help but ignore their anger if he wanted to survive.<br/><br/>The next moment Sungwoo occupied the entire wetlands on Uisadang Street and crossed Youi Street. At the end of the road was the first entrance to Youido Park.<br/><br/>Then, there was an earthquake.<br/><br/>Bang! Guuuuuuuuuuuu―<br/><br/>The whole Youido shook, and birds rose from Youido Park. A red light came out from the deepest part of the park, a forest in the north, and colored the sky.<br/><br/>-Raid boss monster ‘Lizardman Warrior’ has appeared.<br/><br/>* The Lizardman Warrior is receiving the blessing of the gladiator. (90% damage reduction effect is triggered for the multiple attacks.)<br/><br/>* The Lizardman Warrior is looking for a warrior who can compete with him. (If you win against him in a one-on-one fight, you will earn a ‘special title’.)<br/><br/>It was the message that announced the appearance of the boss monster.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, over there. Let’s go first!”<br/><br/>It wasn’t close to the park yet, but since they arrived at the park first, it was clear that Sungwoo was ahead of Jungwoo.<br/><br/>But there suddenly appeared two helicopters.<br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/>While flying low over Youido Park, they went straight toward the red ray of light.<br/><br/>And the Crusader Team members in armor were on board.<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck? Aren’t they the Crusaders? Damn it, these guys stole the show when we found out the location of the boss monster the hard way, right?”<br/><br/>Like Hanho said, the Crusader Team mobilized the helicopters to monopolize the reward item at the moment when the boss monster’s location was exposed.<br/><br/>Instead of fighting the Lizardmen from the periphery, they decided to strike the heart of the enemy position right from the beginning. Obviously, Jungwoo took the action, conscious of Sungwoo,<br/><br/>‘This guy is much more competitive than I think. I can’t trust this kind of person.’<br/><br/>However, under the contract, only the person who defeated the boss monster would take the item, but there was no clause on the even distribution of the rewards.<br/><br/>The current boss raid did not stand for competition originally. It was an ‘alliance’ united as a team, and the victory of one was to be the victory of all. So, nobody would blame the Crusaders.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, what should we do?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo had no way to move faster than the helicopter.<br/><br/>Kieeeeeeeh!<br/><br/>Besides, the entrance to Youido Park was guarded by 20 Lizardmen.<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party had no other way than to move on step by step.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Sungwoo ordered the skeletons to move on first. Because there were no deep puddles and lush bushes in this area, the skeletons easily defeated the Lizardmen.<br/><br/>-You earned 3,800 gold by hunting Lizardmen.<br/><br/>-You earned 3,800 gold by hunting Lizardmen.<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo felt some heat inside his pocket.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Ugh, what the heck is it?”<br/><br/>Something was letting out very intense energy. He pulled out the object that emitted heat, and his wrist was tinged with a brilliant green light.<br/><br/>‘This?’<br/><br/>It was the “EXP coupon” he had obtained from the Hidden Stage. According to the item description, it would glow green when it was possible to level up by using the coupon.<br/><br/>‘Oh, I’m finally Level 15.’<br/><br/>It meant that he could obtain the “Death Scythe” and he reached the level where his “First Awakening” was available.<br/><br/>-You have reached the EXP with which you can level up. Would you like to use the coupon?<br/><br/>Sungwoo used the EXP coupon.<br/><br/>Then, the whole world was colored with black light in front of him. </div><h2 id="chapter93">Chapter 93</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Darkness engulfed Sungwoo. He felt like he was floating in space. Soon, a faint light rose from the distance where his vision ended.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was something there, but he couldn’t recognize it. I knew clearly it existed, but he couldn’t figure out what it was.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What the heck is this?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Sungwoo Yu, the man who holds the reins of death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Is it a voice? No.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He could not know whether he was hearing a voice. However, he seemed to know what it meant. He could not feel any senses at the moment, but he could understand its meaning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Death Sickle, the Grim Reaper, is in death. Witness death vividly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, Sungwoo returned to reality.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-All stats increase since you have reached Level 15 (+2)<br/><br/><br/><br/>*The ‘Level Up Card Draw’ is excluded at your current level.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Exclusive Quest]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Title: Who is the master of death? – 2<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Type: Target acquisition<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Goal: Grab the ‘Death Scythe’ first<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Reward: 1st Awakening, Exclusive Skill<br/><br/><br/><br/>*You have witnessed the great upcoming death. And that’s an overwhelming power that you can’t dare to hold. If you don’t develop the power corresponding to that, you will be assimilated to the power of the “Lich” and become his servant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*’Death Scythe- Grim Reaper’ is in ‘Death’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Your choice affects your ‘destiny’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The contents have changed. The location of the Death Scythe, “Grim Reaper,” was revealed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo? Hey?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You just disappeared for about 10 seconds.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I know.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, is that your skill too? Great!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Into death? Witness death? What the heck does it mean?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt like his head was in the clouds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Kuggugugugugugu….<br/><br/><br/><br/>An explosion sound was heard. When he lifted his head, a fire helicopter was crashing, with its body going round and round.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I didn’t think I could get it anyway. I’ve got to move over there first.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He couldn’t give up just because he was behind Junghoon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho, Jisu!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at them and said, “From now on, we’re going to advance. Myongsu, if you can’t follow us, please join the other team who arrives here late.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? Well…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s move!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party started charging towards the place where the boss monster was located, namely in the direction of the place where the helicopter was crashing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Youido Boss Raid live broadcast was being watched by 17,555 viewers at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, this indicated the number of the devices they currently had access to. Given that they were watching it on one device at the same time, there were much more viewers watching it live now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Junghoon intended, the viewers did not think of the raid as a mere entertainment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They took it as the human beings’ great challenge for the unknown phenomenon as well the sign of some hope that there would emerge a ‘group’ that they could rely on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Therefore, most of the comments were marked by their full support. When the light came out with the earthquake, the boss monster appeared and the Crusader team flew on a helicopter, most of the viewers forgot about the Necromancer except for a few.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They just focused on the huge fight that the cameraman was broadcasting live at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dudududu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Look over there! Boss monster!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment the deputy commander, Minhum, shouted urgently, the cameraman zoomed the camera on the location.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Raid boss monster ‘Lizardman Warrior’ has appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A sleek black Lizardman was standing with his legs crossed on a large altar made of marble in the middle of Youido Park.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was a “Lizardman Warrior,” Raid Boss Monster. Soon, he opened his eyes and slowly raised his head. His bright yellow eyes turned to the helicopter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His every movement was disciplined in a leisurely manner as if he was a martial artist who had been training for a long time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As expected, he’s much bigger than a regular Lizardman! Over 3 meters tall…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Minhun could not finish explaining the live scene unfolding before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everything was broadcast live on the screen at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Lizardman Warrior slowly raised himself, lifted the iron spear lying on the right side, and threw the spear in a very elegant and gentle pose, all of which was being broadcast on real time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The spear hit the fuselage of the helicopter Minhum was aboard. It broke through the driver’s seat and blew the pilot’s head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Weeeeeeing! Weeeeeeing! Weeeeeing!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The helicopter quickly lost its balance and tilted at an angle. The helicopter equipped with broadcasting cameras transmitted the crashing process live into the monitor screen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhh! We’re crashing down!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The helicopter with a team of ten Crusaders crashed on the ground. Besides, even the crusader commander, Junghoon, was on it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wooduk! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The helicopter’s fuselage fell freely and broke down a tree. Just before it crashed, a familiar voice burst out from somewhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“A domain of blind gods!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Kugunuuuuug! Quaguagua!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, a golden shield wrapped around him in all directions. The helicopter was crushed completely in a tremendous shock, but the people in it survived.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have survived!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum uttered an exclamation. At that moment, the cameraman moved the camera to capture the image of somebody. Its target was a tall man radiating light, Junghoon wearing white full-plate armor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The Crusader Team! Ready for battle!” He shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he grabbed the crooked door and got out. He pulled out the great sword on his back. At that moment, two Lizardmen jumped out of the bush.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their heads were cut off at the same time. There was thick blood on his white sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Deputy, realign the team members!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes! Crusader Team! Realign around the Commander!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The cameraman chased him absent-mindedly, constantly filming his action on the screen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another helicopter was hovering in the sky beyond his shoulders. He could see his team members dropping in rappels.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Lizardmen are coming from everywhere!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kieeeeeeeeh! Kieeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon a huge number of Lizardmen raided the Crusader Team. Javelins were flown from all sides and struck their protective shields. It was natural that they were in for such an attack because they rushed to the center of the enemy camp rather than attacking from the periphery step by step.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Confront them with your back against the helicopter!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusaders, whose average level was 11, were strong enough to resist their attack easily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They quickly smashed the Lizardmen charging at them with the swords.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even if they were exposed to the Lizardmen’s attack for a moment, their protective shields prevented damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The crew members in the rear fired massive catapults continuously. The catapults penetrated the leathers of the Lizardmen with a single blow, incapacitating them.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“Now is the time to attack them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kill them now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The assault crew members immediately rushed to smash them. As if they were connected to each other like cogs, they repeatedly fired catapults, hit them and retreated for another attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nevertheless, what stood out was Junghoon’s crossbow-sword. When he pulled the cross guard’s bow, a golden light wrapped around the sword. When he released it, a ray of gold light flashed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tuwoooooong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Three Lizardmen who ran out along the trail with a tremendous roar collapsed immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He penetrated their heads with the bow at a single shot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did you see his performance a moment ago? That is the best of the Youngdungpo Prosecutor!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>All of the scenes about his fighting were captured on camera and broadcast live.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The viewers’ reaction was of course tremendous, with the chatting window full of comments extolling his performance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon turned, and his handsome face was captured on the camera.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He shouted, frowning one eyebrow, “Prepare for the second raid and the appearance of the boss monster!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The twenty Crusaders moved in unison and lined up around him. Then, all of them raised their swords and stared straight ahead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They looked like armored medieval knights, which was a perfect cut for their publicity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They waited for the upcoming battle, and their expressions were captured vividly on the camera.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Something is coming! Be prepared!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get prepared, everybody!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then came a moment of silence<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump… Thump… Thump…<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a roaring sound that broke the silence<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something was coming this way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haaaaaah…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whew…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tough breathing of the Crusaders waiting for the fight was heard loudly on the screen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, breaking through the drooping tree trunk, a huge hand popped out in front of the Crusaders. Then came out a long mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gruuuuuuuuu-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, the Lizardman Warrior appeared with glossy black scales engraved with blue tattoos, sparkling amber eyes, and a wide long sword in his right hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t just the Crusader Team members who were overwhelmed by his appearance. Everyone watching this scene live on the screen felt the same way, and their chatting stopped all at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! </div><h2 id="chapter94">Chapter 94</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>At that moment, the Crusaders began to shoot catapults at the Lizardman Warrior all at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Lizardman Warrior is being blessed by the gladiator. (90% damage reduction effect is given to him for the opponent’s multiple attacks.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusaders’ attack was useless because the Lizardman Warrior was receiving a special buff.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Stop shooting!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Stop shooting, everybody!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As Junghoon ordered them, the Lizardman Warrior charged toward him so quickly that they could not respond.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Lizardman Warrior kicked away one of the Crusader Team members standing in his way. The member was thrown into the crashed helicopter fuselage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the next moment, the Lizardman Warrior swung his wide sword and cut the man’s body in half. The shield and full-plate armor protecting him were pierced with a single blow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Someone rushed to the Lizardman Warrior, aiming at his legs, but he was shoved and turned upside down as the Lizardman Warrior lifted him by his right leg.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Lizardman Warrior wielded the man like a blunt weapon and disrupted the battle line of the Crusaders. Then, he threw it at the tree and lifted his big sword with both hands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cling!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a ray of light struck the right shoulder of the warrior. His body was pushed back and he fell into a pothole. He turned his head, frowning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gruuuuuuuuuuuuh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You’re my target. Crusader Team, occupy the dungeon while I get rid of this monster,” said Junghoon, the Youngdungpo Prosecutor. After saying that, Junghoon lifted his sword and charged forward.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The black monster and the white knight clashed head-on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clank! Clank!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two swords made a tremendous clanking sound when they clashed. Red sparks jumped from where their blades met. When they bumped into each other, the leaves of the trees nearby were falling violently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon, 2 meters tall, wasn’t backing down while fighting the monster, over 3 meters tall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Making use of the advantage of him being smaller than the monster, Junghoon swung his sword, circling him. As a result, the Lizardman Warrior found it hard to focus on him and wield his sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clunk! Clunk! Clunk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon’s strikes were effective. The Lizardman Warrior responded quickly, pulling back, but staggered out of balance. Junghoo didn’t stop attacking and stretched out his right hand as soon as the Lizardman Warrior was off his guard momentarily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Peeeeeeeing!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A tremendous light erupted from his right hand. The light struck the body of the Lizardman Warrior with a fierce wave as if it had mass.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Guaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Struck by that blow, the Lizardman Warrior began to step back because of the impact, and the ground split as his heavy legs pushed down and through it. Without stopping his attack, Junghoon continued to create the rays of light, and the Lizardman Warrior was eventually struck into a tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, that’s amazing! Are you watching it right now? Just one person is destroying that huge monster with a single blow. Are you all watching him now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon’s deputy Minhum, standing behind the cameraman, conveyed what was going on to the thousands of viewers. However, his voice soon changed into command.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get ready! They are swarming now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The battle continued between the Crusader Team and other monsters while Junghoon was confronting the Lizardman Warrior. Fortunately, Junghoo’s supporting troops began to arrive.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s skeletons came in, followed by Ansok and Kangyun’s teams who avoided the battle as much as possible after the boss monster appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the camera only captured Junghoon at his best. He drew a bow and shot the arrows at the Lizardman Warrior who was stuck in the tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tuuuuwoong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A ray of light penetrated the chest of the Lizardman Warrior. Blood gushed from his chest, and his body shook violently. Junghoon didn’t let down his guard and continued to shoot arrows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tuuuuuwwoong! Tuuuuuwoong! Tuuuuuuuwooong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The warrior’s whole body was stained with dark red blood. However, his amber eyes were still clear, which bothered Junghoon very much.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Why?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>His head was habitually in the clouds when he was faced with these kinds of incomprehensible situations. His excessive desire to outpower the opponent recklessly was his persistent problem.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If I dig out his eyeballs, he’s going to collapse once and for all,’ Junghoon thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He grabbed his sword tightly and rushed toward the monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the Lizardman Warrior smiled. He stuck his red tongue out of his mouth. Junghoon stopped before he knew it, but it was too late.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pooh-hwa-ahah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Lizardman Warrior’s jaw opened impossibly wide and a large burst of flames shot out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was Breath. The flames engulfed Junghoon’s body. He was helplessly pushed back, and the shield around his body flickered and eventually disappeared. He was exposed to the heat of the flames.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Cough!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon fell to his knees. The flames stopped. Fortunately, at the last minute, he protected himself by lifting his sword. The blade of his sword was turned red as if it had been dipped in and taken out of a furnace.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, don’t come to me!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His deputy stopped while trying to approach him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you come, you will be killed…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon’s face through the armor was distorted in flames.<br/><br/><br/><br/>By now, Minhum realized that nobody could confront the Lizardman Warrior if Junghoon could not beat him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even this scene of Junghoon’s miserable condition was being broadcasted live.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A tremendous wave of cheer poured out in the chat forum on the screen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But what happened next was really a shock.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Lizardman Warrior holding the long sword began to walk toward Junghoon. His body began to swell like a balloon and his bones twisted here and there beneath his scales. He was transforming into something bizarre. He soon became a dragon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The Real Raid boss monster “Drake the Wanderer” has appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Specifically, it was a wingless dragon, a Drake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was the beginning of “Phase 2.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon raised his body, but Drake charged at him. Junghoon had no more power to confront him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clunk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>He pulled out the sword and tried to stop Drake’s flying paws.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly afterward, Junghoon knelt and got hit hard by Drake twice. At the next moment, Drake swung its heavy tail, rotating his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hit hard by his tail, Junghoon was thrust into a nearby tree. He tried to raise his head, but his head drooped. He passed out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh no! I can’t believe this…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The cameraman was shooting the scene of Minhum screaming desperately, and Junghoon’s wounded body. Then, the cameraman turned the angle to film the monster over 10 meters tall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was nobody who blocked the monster now. Opening his amber eyes wide, he approached Junghoon proudly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum and the Crusaders, who were standing nearby, grabbed strong weapons, but none of them came forward to confront him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum said, looking into the camera, “It’s over. Our raid failed like this. Sorry. Really sorry…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, however, something flew toward Drake’s head. It was the body of the Lizardman Warrior.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>His body exploded in the air, and the resulting flames struck Drake’s head directly.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Drake turned his head and cried out in pain. The next moment, something jumped off the top of the tree.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>It was a Weretiger skeleton holding a huge bone hammer in his hand. While falling, he bent his back and struck the back of Drake’s head hard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Drake’s body tilted violently with a roar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, several Werebear skeletons popped out of the bushes. A total of four charged at the giant monster at once and got onto his body. While Drake was staggering in confusion, they grabbed the horns from his head and struck him to the floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Kugugugugugu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>Drake collapsed upside down. Then, Werewolves popped out. Holding long spears, they stabbed the neck of the fallen Drake ruthlessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Some of the spears broke without breaking through the scales, but three of them broke through his neck. That was a fatal blow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ahhhhhhhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Drake twisted his body. Then, someone walked out from the shadow of the tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was the Necromancer wearing a dark green robe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The camera captured the scene of him approaching proudly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Necromancer?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A man standing over the fallen Drake, a moment of silence, those in the chat room holding their breath in amazement. Amid the silence, Hanho suddenly shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Since the No. 3 player was defeated, it was time for the No. 2 player to show his force.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>The chat room was noisy again with an overwhelming response. </div><h2 id="chapter95">Chapter 95</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Shortly after the raid began, people in the village, including Kyongsu, were holding cell phones. They were watching the broadcast of the raid live in real-time.<br/><br/>The camera mounted on the helicopter filmed all over Youido.<br/><br/>“Oh my God, Youido has turned into a total jungle.”<br/><br/>“You bet. I went there only a few weeks ago…”<br/><br/>The image of Youido, seen from above in the sky, was transformed beyond its original shape.<br/><br/>Youido’s huge forest of buildings had been transformed into a green area overnight.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it was terrible to see the giant reptiles, the Lizardmen, moving around here and there in the swamps.<br/><br/>The cameraman was filming the allied forces preparing for battle, and the raid began soon.<br/><br/>The raid started through the five bridges crossing the tributary of the Han River, located in the south of Youido.<br/><br/>The camera lens, which was moving slowly, began to turn quickly when the cameraman turned to record the Crusaders breaking through “Youi No. 2 Bridge”.<br/><br/>The scene of the Lizardmen crawling out of the wetlands was horrible, but the Crusader Team advanced valiantly without being scared.<br/><br/>“By the way, why is the cameraman showing those guys only?”<br/><br/>“It looks like they wanted to be shown as the main characters of this raid from the beginning.”<br/><br/>The villagers were dissatisfied that Sungwoo and his party were not seen on the screen. They earnestly hoped they could see how Sungwoo was performing.<br/><br/>And their wishes came true in no time.<br/><br/>“Oh, he’s on the screen now!”<br/><br/>A series of explosions was heard somewhere in succession, and the camera angle was turned east.<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s group, who crossed the relatively long “Youi Bridge,” had already reached Youido Station.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>Along with the huge explosions, the edges of the swamps were thrown into the air and vividly captured on camera. Facing the lush reed field, Sungwoo’s party began to move on bravely after clearing the vast obstacle of the swamps by using the Corpse Explosion.<br/><br/>” Oh, my God!”<br/><br/>Even the camera operator, who remained silent all along, looked at the screen and exclaimed.<br/><br/>Sungwoo used explosions to destroy the environment favorable to the monsters.<br/><br/>His performance was brilliant enough to elicit thundering cheers from the chat room.<br/><br/>“Wow! Sungwoo is much faster!”<br/><br/>“My son, Hanho, is again shooting daggers in the rear?”<br/><br/>“No, Hanho has fought brilliantly, too.”<br/><br/>“Oh, really? How did he fight?”<br/><br/>“Look. The protective shield around him hasn’t been broken. Besides, every dagger he has thrown hit their targets!”<br/><br/>On the close-up screen were the images of Sungwoo’s party fighting the monsters brilliantly. Also on the screen were the members of Myongsu’s archery team who were just standing there, at a loss of what to do.<br/><br/>However, the camera angle didn’t focus on Sungwoo’s party for long. Shortly afterward somebody was talking to each other, then the pilot turned the helicopter in the other direction abruptly.<br/><br/>“Ah, what the heck! Why are they not broadcasting such an important scene?”<br/><br/>However, Kyongsu’s dissatisfaction and the anger among the viewers on the screen didn’t last long because they got carried away with the magnificent appearance of the raid boss and the Crusader Team getting aboard the helicopter in an orderly manner.<br/><br/>The situation as shown on the screen was too important for them to whine about the cameraman’s irresponsible actions.<br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/>– Hello! My name is Minhum Sung, the deputy commander of the Crusader Team. We’re going to change our strategy and drop directly over the boss monster’s head.<br/><br/>When the narrator appeared, they concentrated on the screen much more.<br/><br/>-The majority of the enemy troops are in the south due to our simultaneous air raids. We thought we couldn’t give up this golden opportunity.<br/><br/>The helicopter illuminated Youido Park, which was transformed into something like Amazon. At last, the ‘Lizardman Warrior’ appeared…<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The helicopter hit by a javelin crashed.<br/><br/>-Uuuuuuuuuh! We’re crashing!<br/><br/>It was a shocking scene, but miraculously nobody was killed because of Junghoon’s protective shield skills. Those watching the tragic crash of the helicopter were deeply touched by the scene, especially Junghoon’s dramatic turnaround with his skills.<br/><br/>“Wow… that guy is awesome!”<br/><br/>“Not a single person was killed. Honestly, it’s cool.”<br/><br/>“So awesome!”<br/><br/>The chat room was also full of comments cheering the Youngdungpo Prosecutor. Even Kyongsu and the village people supported him unwittingly.<br/><br/>The Crusader Team realigned their forces in the jungle, confronted the incoming enemies, and finally faced the boss monster.<br/><br/>“Crazy!”<br/><br/>“Oh No…”<br/><br/>The Crusader Team began to collapse helplessly, faced with the overwhelming power of the Lizardman Warrior.<br/><br/>It was Junghoon who saved the situation, however.<br/><br/>-Tuwoooooong!<br/><br/>He pushed the warrior with a golden ray of light, and instead of being pushed back in a one-on-one fight, he began to drive the monster into a corner by swinging his sword. The fight scene was filled with suspense.<br/><br/>“Good! Push them hard!”<br/><br/>“Oh, it looks like we are winning now.”<br/><br/>Even their expectation did not last long.<br/><br/>“Ah…”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Junghoo’s body was engulfed by the Breath released by the Lizardman Warrior. The next moment, he was hit by Drake’s tail and passed out.<br/><br/>Everyone was silent for a while.<br/><br/>-The fighting is over. The raid failed like this. Sorry. Really sorry…<br/><br/>The moment even the narrator, Deputy Commander Minhum, was talking in despair.<br/><br/>“He is Sungwoo! Look at the screen!”<br/><br/>“He’s come! I knew he would appear!”<br/><br/>“Crazy! He is beating the monsters so easily!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo appeared finally.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>“Necromancer?”<br/><br/>Minhum was startled, but at the same time, he felt relieved. The moment Junghoon was defeated, he thought everything was over, but he forgot there was hope.<br/><br/>It was none other than the other hero he held in check so religiously, namely the Necromancer, ranked 2nd in the players’ list.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>He pushed “Drake the Wanderer” with great force without giving him any chance to strike back. Sungwoo hit Drake in the chest.<br/><br/>‘Perhaps…’<br/><br/>Minhum hoped the Necromancer could win. He hoped that the Necromancer could defeat Drake and end the battle once and for all.<br/><br/>‘The Necromancer is winning.’<br/><br/>And it seemed possible he could win.<br/><br/>Kuuaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>Suppressed by Sungwoo, Drake roared and shook his body. Since the beast skeletons, who were so huge, were pressing down after grasping his horns and limbs, he could not get out of their hold no matter how hard he struggled.<br/><br/>When he hit the ground with his claws, the ground split around his claws, and dirt scattered in all directions. On such occasions, the skeletons wiggled their bodies, but they didn’t begin to attack because they were given synergy related to power.<br/><br/>At that moment, a pile of bones sprang up from the backpacks the skeletons were carrying. The bones merged into a sharp long spear. It was the same weapon that pierced Drake’s neck.<br/><br/>If he were stabbed by that several times, Drake wouldn’t be able to withstand it, no matter how strong it was.<br/><br/>‘I wonder if the fighting will be over so simply like that.’<br/><br/>At that moment, one of the Crusader Team members urgently shouted, “Deputy Commander! A huge number of Lizardmen are coming up from the tributary of the Han River!”<br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/>“They are the mainstay of the boss monster who the Crusader Team failed to get rid of.”<br/><br/>Hearing the roaring of their boss, the remaining Lizardmen began to flock.<br/><br/>Minhum came to his senses all of a sudden.<br/><br/>“Defend! Everybody, move!”<br/><br/>“Who do you defend? The Commander?”<br/><br/>“No! Protect the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>The condition for this raid’s boss attack was a one-on-one battle, but it was just the limitation placed on the player. There was no rule that even the monsters had to follow it.<br/><br/>“Son of a bitch! They deceived us! They should not have given us the quest from the beginning!”<br/><br/>Keeeeeeeeeeh! Keeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/>Soon, dozens of Lizardmen popped out of the grass everywhere. The Crusader Team and their allied forces entered into the fierce fighting without realigning their forces properly.<br/><br/>It was crazy to confront the monsters dashing from all sides in a jungle where they could not see anything.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>“Damn it! They are coming up from the left!”<br/><br/>“Hey, I need some cover fire!”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sungwoo stabbed several long spears into Drake’s body. He quickly cut through his windpipe just in case.<br/><br/>Then he moved the skeletons to stop the Lizardmen from rushing toward him.<br/><br/>At that moment, Hanho shouted, “Watch out! Drake is getting up!”<br/><br/>Kruuuuuuuu…<br/><br/>Drake moved again.<br/><br/>“What the heck?” </div><h2 id="chapter96">Chapter 96</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Drake got up after shaking off the skeletons pressing down on his body. Two Werebears grabbed his horns and held him tightly, but Drake pushed them off easily by shaking his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I obviously cut through his windpipe.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stabbed seven spears into the back of his neck. He clearly saw Drake’s eyes roll back and his tongue stick out. ‘Something has changed.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stepped back and disappeared into the shadows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This is Phase 3.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Phase 2” was not the end of this raid.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Drake roared, stretching out his long neck. Then his amber eyes turned red, and black protrusions began to shoot out along the back of his head and neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Hidden Raid boss monster ‘Little Host who Swallowed Seed’ appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You have already completed the group quest ‘What do heroes and stars have in common?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Access to Yeouido is blocked until the boss monster is defeated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was as Sungwoo expected. The quest of killing the raid boss alone had already been completed. After that, something new was starting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘There have been so many variables and anomalies in this raid. They are making fun of us…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>This game has always been held like this. There was no standard way of killing the boss monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the moment when they were about to reap the fruits of a successful attack, they were pushed back into another fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was familiar with such a pattern well. So, hiding in the shadows, he monitored Drake’s movements as well as the surrounding situation around him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘So what’s next this time?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, something he didn’t expect would happen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Stop them! Stop them from coming here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There is something weird about the Lizardmen! They are like zombies!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not surprisingly, madness began to grow in the eyes of Lizardmen. They threw away their weapons, and charged Sungwoo’s party and their allies with bare hands like zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kruuuuuuk! Kruuuuuuuk! Kruuuuuuk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even their cries changed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The allies resorted to all kinds of long-range weapons and magic to stop them. However, even if some parts of their bodies were ripped apart, the Lizardmen didn’t back down and continued to charge, so Sungwoo and his allies had no choice but to fight in a hand-to-hand combat with fists and knives.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kruuuuuk! Kruuuuuk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They drooled and bit with their hard jaws.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhh! Go away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Go away! You’re biting my ears!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With Lizardmen entangled with the allied forces all over the place, they fought in the mud.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the same for Jisu and Hanho. Sungwoo found a Lizardman approaching quickly behind Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho, get out of the way!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled the trigger of the repeating crossbow from the shadows. Then, a “Shadow Alternate” was created thanks to the effect of the new item “Shadow King’s Ring.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The shadows in the same shape as Sungwoo started firing the repeating crossbows made of shadows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of arrows hit the Lizardman in the face and torso. The firing speed was so tremendous one Lizardman, who ran like a zombie, staggered back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahaaah! When did you come! Go away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho turned around and threw a dagger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 4,500 gold by hunting ‘crazy Lizardman’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stopped attacking and threw himself into the shadow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The real problem is not this kind of Lizardman.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Drake, the wanderer, who stood tall again, or the “Young Host who Swallowed Seed,” had a mouthful of flames.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pooh-hwa-ahah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, Drake let out the flames of Breath. It was different from the Lizardman Warrior’s Breath. He spewed out a long beam of flames and slowly bent his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh! Help!…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, everything near his head was burnt black in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Keeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Among those burnt black were Lizardmen. In other words, Drake destroyed everything around him, regardless of whether they were his enemy or friend.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘How should I deal with him?’ Sungwoo thought for a moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The huge monster stoutly walked into the flames it had created. Sungwoo noticed the corpses scattered under his feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A series of corpse explosions occurred, engulfing his legs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kruuuuuuuuu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s attack was useless.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rather, the monster turned his head and stared at Sungwoo. Sungwoo was probably hidden in the shadow, but the monster seemed to wander through the shadow, rolling his red eyes back and forth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, finally, the monster noticed something in the shadow and opened his snout and held the flames in his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo quickly launched himself in the other direction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pooh-hwa-ahah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>An enormous heat came behind him back. The monster turned his head and moved the pillar of fire toward Sungwoo who was on the run.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quarrrrrrrrr!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo moved a Werebear skeleton to block him. At the same time, he made a shield by pulling out bones from his backpack. Now, the monster let out Breath. An enormous heat began to wrap around Sungwoo’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the Breath attack stopped, the Werebear skeleton had turned into ashes and scattered. Fortunately, it did not damage Sungwoo’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, I shouldn’t allow this attack…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>For the first time, Sungwoo uttered something dispirited. He immediately gathered all the skeletons and made long spears. He had no other choice. The battle from now on would be dragged out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Skeletons and zombies charged at Drake from all directions, thrusting the long spears into Drake’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, when Drake rotated his body and swung its tail violently, more than half of the skeletons were destroyed. Their bone fragments scattered in all directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuh…!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The skeletons managed to thrust some spears into his body, but they didn’t seem to cause much damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had to sacrifice more than one beast skeleton in order to thrust even one spear into Drake’s body. It was difficult to attack the monster and avoid the monster’s counterattack right after the attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I can resurrect Lizardmen, but they are slow, compared to the monster.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was clear that Lizardmen also had strong skeletons, comparable to the beast skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, since their skeletal structure itself was not specialized for flexible or fast movement, they were inferior to the beast skeletons. In other words, the more beast skeletons he lost, the less likely he would inflict damage to Drake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I can’t fight Drake in this condition. Let me retreat first.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was forced to order the skeletons back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he noticed the obstacles were removed, Drake began to rush toward Sungwoo, roaring.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>He should have made the decision a little earlier if he had wanted to give up, for Drake had been targeting Sungwoo for a long time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘That monster is too fast.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sunwoo jumped into the shadow, but the monster’s red eyes followed him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was obvious that the monster had something similar to the “sense” skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Drake opened his mouth wide. It was the fire of Breath again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pooh-hwa-ahah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo built a defensive wall by gathering all nearby skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A huge flame swept through the stacked skeletons. Sungwoo curled up behind the shield and endured the flames.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘But, this time, I barely managed to stop the flame.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time again all the beast skeletons that blocked Drake’s attack turned into ashes. Now Sungwoo’s elite forces were completely crushed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The only skeleton who survived was Orun. He could survive because he was short. Pulling out a knife, Orun defended Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- Thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The huge monster, Drake, approached Orun as he stood before Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Drake casually lifted its forefoot and slammed it into the head of the goblin skeleton, Orun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Orun let go of the knife, jumped into the air and grabbed Drake’s forefoot with one hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since Orun levelled up by absorbing the mana of numerous boss monsters, he jumped onto Drake’s body readily and climbed up to the protrusion of Drake’s head at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>He succeeded in taking out Drake’s right eyeball. Drake screamed in pain and hit Orun by swinging his head wildly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Orun was thrust into the mud, and Drake’s forefoot fell mercilessly on him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Orun’s bone armor was shattered and his ribs shot out. There was a crack in his skull.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, only pieces of bones that could not be recognized were left behind in the mud.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your subordinate spirit will return to eternal death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s first skeleton disappeared like that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no! Orun!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho screamed desperately behind Drake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Orun! Damn it! Sungwoo, get away quickly!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shouting at Sungwoo, Hanho started throwing daggers at Drake’s back, but it was useless.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, run away, Hanho!” Sungwoo shouted back at Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While circling around Drake, Sungwoo fired the repeating crossbows at his injured eye. His attack was useless. The next moment he was attacked by Drake’s flying tail.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The shield Sungwoo held in his hand was shattered, breaking his left arm.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His body was thrown over a tree and bounced out of the park. Everyone in the fighting place was astonished to see Sungwoo helplessly collapsing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Even the Necromancer!” </div><h2 id="chapter97">Chapter 97</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Damn it! It’s really over…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>All the fighting scenes were faithfully being broadcast live by the camera operator with a thorough sense of mission. Those watching the scene in the chat room were more shocked than when they witnessed Junghoo’s helpless defeat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The fight wasn’t over yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Roaring violently, Drake began to run in the direction where Necromancer was thrown.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He broke and crushed the tree before disappearing into the forest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, it’s not over yet. We don’t know yet.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mumbling like that, the camera operator, holding the camera in one hand, ran in the direction where the Necromancer and Drake disappeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>People in the chat room were full of despair. The raid, which they started to bring hope for the survivors, was about to end in a dire failure.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The camera captured Drake’s back again. The huge monster was running on the wide road under the tall skyscrapers. It was Youi Street in front of IFC Mall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The Necromancer is still fighting!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The camera operator was broadcasting the fight. The bloody Necromancer was running away through the abandoned cars on the road while firing the crossbows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, his attack seemed to cause no damage to Drake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Drake chased the Necromancer, pushing and trampling the vehicles in front of him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The distance between the two was getting narrower.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Furthermore, when Drake watched the Necromancer moving, it seemed the latter had pain in his left arm and leg. It was obvious that he suffered fractures after he was hit by Drake’s tail.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t think he can survive…” The camera operator muttered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer was no match for Drake by any standards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And really, the last moment for him came.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Drake’s mouth glowed red, letting out the fire of Breath at the Necromancer just ahead of him. The Necromancer had no time to escape. He lifted his shield to block Drake’s fatal attack in vain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The shield in his hand was shattered before melting. Soon the Necromancer’s whole body was swallowed up by the flame.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo died like that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, he was lucky that he could survive until now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Yeah, he was ridiculously lucky.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The pain was instant, but the kaleidoscope was longer than that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I never knew I would be burnt to death.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He remembered his family members screaming in the fire. Maybe he was lucky at that time because he was out when his house caught on fire.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since he was so weak back then, he survived because he did not have the courage to jump into the fire. Even that was sheer luck for him. Avoiding disaster was what everybody wanted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But sometimes he thought about it. ‘If I had had a little more courage before and jumped into that fire, could I have saved my family? And wouldn’t that be more lucky for me? Am I not lucky, and trying to rationalize myself after running away from the fire?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>This raid game was similar. This time he tried not to run away, so he seemed to have survived a little longer as a result.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His vision was blurred, and it got dark, but strangely enough, a black sickle was seen in that darkness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo grabbed it unwittingly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have completed the exclusive quest  with ‘Target Acquisition’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Rewards are given. (1st Awakening, Exclusive Skill)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Your destiny changes subtly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ahhhhhhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Drake burned the Necromancer, then raised its head and roared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The camera operator captured the scene on the screen. In fact, he couldn’t move, stuck in that place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, Sungwoo!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party ran out of Youido Park, but they stiffened, watching the horrible scene before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clank!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu let go of her sword, watching Sungwoo’s body still burning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusader Team members and other friendly forces began to walk out one by one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They managed to defeat the ambush by the crazy Lizardmen, but that’s all they could do. They couldn’t come to Sunwoo’s rescue.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, even the Necromancer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Cough! We failed… Sungwoo…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum walked out, supporting the injured Junghoon. Although Junghoon came to senses, he could hardly stand on his own.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander, we have to retreat.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think so. Sorry, Sungwoo.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They turned slowly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment a message suddenly appeared before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in the affected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s body slowly began to float into the air, and a black mist overflowed from his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Krrrrrrrr…<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even Drake began to step back, full of caution. The black mist filled the area around the IFC Mall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wooooooooong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly, a gust gathered and pushed out the black smoke. Then, an unknown green wave began in the middle of the gust.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Someone shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s the Necromancer!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right there, Sungwoo, with some bones of his face and arms revealed, stood, holding a huge black sickle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is he the Necromancer? That is…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was Lich.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a bizarre sound was heard inside Youido Park and beyond the forest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A huge number of something was coming from the battlefield where the battle had ended.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment Sungwoo saw a black sickle dimly in the dark and grabbed it unwittingly, he felt the sensations of his whole body revived.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…..Uuuuuuuuuh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He felt like all the pain, which he felt when his flesh and intestines melted in the flames, had engulfed his body and crushed his central nervous system, but soon his pain started to stop. Rather, he became numb to it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he opened his eyes, he was floating in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have completed the exclusive quest  with ‘Target Acquisition’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Rewards are given. (1st Awakening, Exclusive Skill)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Your destiny changes subtly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The place where Death Scythe, the “Grim Reaper,” was located was really “in death”. The moment his breathing stopped, the quest conditions were satisfied.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have been ‘resurrected’ with the Necromancer’s job trait. (Waiting time 31 days)<br/><br/><br/><br/>And by obtaining the Death Scythe, Sungwoo reached a certain level.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have reached the ‘1st Awakening State.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You can summon the masterpiece, ‘Grim Reaper’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You can resurrect a large monster as your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-A ‘Secret Store Coupon’ is given as a result of your achievement of the ‘1st Awakening’ for the 9th time in history (Limited to 50 people)<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Summon of Grim Reaper<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: 1st Awakening<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Consumption: 0<br/><br/><br/><br/>*You can summon the Death Scythe ‘Grim Reaper’ for just 1 hour a day and temporarily become ‘Lich’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>+ Lion’s Sphere: While you are gaining Lich’s power, the number of your subordinate spirit increases by (+50) and all stats increase by (+10).<br/><br/><br/><br/>*In addition, you can resurrect the destroyed undead nearby and regenerate them ‘indefinitely’ as many as your ‘maximum number of subordinate spirits.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whew…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo breathed in. He didn’t know how the air was going in and out of his mouth. Obviously, he didn’t have a human body now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The bones were still exposed in half of his face, and both arms, including his shoulders, had no flesh. In other words, Sungwoo was in the shape of undead Lich, whose whole body was tattered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Well, I don’t feel that bad.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He moved his stiff neck and looked around. Drake was wandering nearby, on full alert.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, Drake felt Sungwoo had changed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s friendly forces flocked to Youido Park and watched him. Jisu and Hanho were watching him, full of worry, and the camera was still operating behind them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if on cue, a huge number of white demons began to crawl out. It was as if the forest collapsed, pouring out white bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were 16 beast skeletons, 50 Lizardmen skeletons and ten zombies who had been killed by Drake. Hanho opened his eyes wide while watching them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Orun? Are you alive?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Standing at the forefront was the smallest goblin skeleton, Orun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His body, which was shattered into pieces, had been fully restored without any scratches, and a green aura was coming out of his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah! I trusted you, Orun!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, there was no touching reunion. The seventy-seven skeletons, including Orun, passed by the allied forces and began to rush toward Youi Street.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only then did Drake realize that he could not afford to be complacent. Roaring again, he opened his mouth and let out the damn fire of Breath.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pooh-hwa-ahah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo, stepping back while floating in the air, gathered all the bones from the corpses scattered on the road. The bones among the abandoned cars began to soar into the air and gathered in front of Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as four square shields were completed, they were stacked and stopped the fire of Breath. The fierce pillar of fire stopped after melting three shields, and in the meantime, the undead army arrived at the side of the road.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They came in droves this time. Seventy-seven skeletons dispersed wide to the left and right and poured into the road. They ran through the vehicles and climbed the roofs of the cars to charge at their common enemy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrr…. </div><h2 id="chapter98">Chapter 98</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>As if overwhelmed by their fierce charge, Drake stepped back and conjured flames in his mouth again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pooo-hwa-ah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Drake’s power was remarkably weakened. He could not use the skill of Breath indefinitely because he had to exhale it from inside his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and his support forces were different. Their skills were included in the concept of ‘infinity.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kudddddddd―<br/><br/><br/><br/>The skeletons that were crushed and melted, hit directly by the Breath attack, started to rise again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can you see him? The Necromancer is undead… He really doesn’t die!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The camera operator’s voice was full of awe and wonder at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The undead destroyed after Sungwoo gained the additional skill of the Grim Reaper summon, “Sphere of the Dead,” were being revived and regenerated indefinitely. It was literally a chain of death that could never be broken without divine damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though the fire covered his body, the Necromancer stood up again and moved on proudly, broadcast live by the cameraman.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Drake swung his thick tail violently and struck down the skeletons around him at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the skeletons rose up again, reattached their broken parts and rushed to him again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One skeleton turned his broken arm into a long spear, grabbed it and ran like crazy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he thrust the spear into Drake’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how often Drake pushed, smashed and melted the skeletons, they resurrected immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Poooo-hwa-ah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Drake smashed the skeletons on the right, they charged at him from the left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even if Drake trampled on them, they recovered their shattered bodies in a moment. Drake twisted his body like crazy to defend against the skeletons’ attacks, the number of spears stuck in his body gradually increased.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A swarm of tenacious undead closed in on Drake, narrowing the distance between them little by little.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The zombies stuck to his ankles like leeches, obstructing his movement. The more slowly Drake moved, the more fiercely the beast skeletons attacked him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blood gushed from Drake’s pierced black scales.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrk…<br/><br/><br/><br/>Spears were stabbed into his neck and back, belly and waist, legs and tail. As Drake was virtually incapaciated, covered with wounds, the undead climbed on top of him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like a mantis overpowered by a swarm of ants, Drake’s resistance weakened and he began to stop moving slowly. Nevertheless, the undead did not stop attacking him. They plucked the scales with their nails and dug more wounds into his flesh. It seemed that they would not stop until he died.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And finally, his heavy body tilted and collapsed on the asphalt with a thud.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He ran out of his physical strength at last.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrr…<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he collapsed, the undead who were wiggling on his body retreated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo, who was in the shape of Lich and surrounded by a green aura, walked among them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He pulled out the “Ownerless Sword” and handed it to Orun, the first resurrected skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the sword in his right hand, Orun walked to the bedside of the fallen Drake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He thrust the sword into the red eyeball that remained.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that very moment, a message appeared before the eyes of those near Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Days to go before you prove your qualifications: 4,335 days<br/><br/><br/><br/>-By successfully mounting the boss raid of the “Lizardmen’s Marsh” in Youido, you have earned 1,115,556 gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The group quest ‘What do heroes and stars have in common?’ has now ended. (Winner: kor-157)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s all over now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahaha.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it. What did I see there?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At this moment, the chat room was overflowing with so many comments that it was almost impossible to read them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the allied forces on the battlefield could not dare to cheer for Sungwoo’s victory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They knew Sungwoo, the Necromancer, was their leader Junghoon’s rival. As such, Susngwoo not only won the game, but also got tremendous support from the public.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, he was really amazing.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Honestly, the Necromancer is overwhelming. Given his victory this time, I think the difference between the 3rd and 2nd in the rankings would be …”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, be quiet! The Crusader Team is right next to you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, there were lots of people who were already admiring Sungwoo, deeply moved by his brilliant performance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, there appeared a decisive scene that showed Sungwoo’s crucial blow, in addition to his splendid fighting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The deceased will be under your authority<br/><br/><br/><br/>Drake, the behemoth who incapacitated the largest allieed force of the South Korean server, slowly raised himself and stood tall again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, uh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? Has he been resurrected?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, he hasn’t. That is…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time it was different. Drake’s black leather slid down as if it were casting away a shell, and a skeleton made of white bones steadily positioned himself proudly behind Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was Bone Drake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like a reconstruction in the New York Museum of Natural History, Bone Drake was so imposing people lifted their heads before they knew it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is he a skeleton?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crazy, does it make any sense? Who could manipulate that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everyone could not help but be surprised. Those in the chat room were shocked, so were the allies and the Crusader Team, let alone Junghoon, No.3 in the players’ rankings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is just unbelievable…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ignoring them, Sungwoo took Drake’s skin. It was a high-end item. A message came up, saying that it would separate by itself when Sungwoo summoned Drake as his subordinate spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Oh, this is a material that I can use to make equipment.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Drake’s Leather<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Class: Hero<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Manufacturing material<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: A young black Drake’s skin and scales. The quality itself is not good because it has not yet fully grown, but it is still strong enough by any standard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Heart of the dragon class (Lower)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Manufacturing material<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: The heart of a dragon is quite different from that of other animals. It is an item that should be treated with great care.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have acquired the title of ‘Amateur Dragon Hunter’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Increased stamina (+2)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Increased fire immunity (+30%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo collected this much from Drake’s body, but he acquired an unexpected item.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Oh, I can get this one here!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked down at his right hand. There was a golden seed on it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Seed of World Tree<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Myth<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Unknown<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Unknown<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: You feel something like wonder for some reason.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was the reward for the “group quest” this time. Immediately after he won the group quest, Sungwoo acquired the item that was originally inside Drake’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If this is the seed of the world tree, it’s directly related to the bad ending that I viewed through the prophetic stone.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>This little seed was as good as the starting point of “Korean Server Bad Ending-2” that would end up swallowing up the entire Korean peninsula after starting in Youido.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, the unidentified figures called “the Fallen” would try to take possession of this object.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hello, Necromancer!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, someone urgently approached him, calling his name. Sungwoo turned around, hiding the seed in his pocket.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can I get your brief comment on this game?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was the camera operator. He pushed the camera towards him with a tense look.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo replied with an expressionless look, “Don’t trust the group that says they will protect you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This raid showed that all those groups who attracted survivors, promoting themselves as their defenders, were just good for nothing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The same was true of the vampire group that tried to slaughter the survivors, as well as the Liberation Guild, who actually tried to gather the survivors to build a new world system.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their collective power did not benefit the individual.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you can’t jump into the fire, you cannot get out of it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, Sungwoo momentarily regretted it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I have nothing more to say…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Kuguuuuuuuuuu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>What Sungwoo was trying to say was buried in the sudden roaring of something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The camera angle turned straight and captured the images of the southern tributary of the Han River. Black smoke was seen rising on the screen that was trembling violently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, that place!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s Youngdungpo Station!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Kuuuuuuuuugung! Kugguuuuuuuu…<br/><br/><br/><br/>The explosions were heard in the direction of Youngdungpo Station. As the explosions continued, more and more black smoke rose up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, the Crusader Team began to get busy. They communicated with someone using a walkie-talkie, then ran straight in the direction of the place where the helicopter landed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander! Someone is attacking the station!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who the hell is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a completely unexpected terror attack. The main base of the Liberation Guild, Youngdungpo Station, was attacked by someone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Deputy Commander…..”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes! Damn it, Crusader Team! Get on board the helicopter!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo carefully looked at the smoke rising into the sky. That black smoke was familiar to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Yeah, I know it’s definitely the Breath of the Abyss. Who else is using those death bombs other than me?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo recalled one group at that moment. </div><h2 id="chapter99">Chapter 99</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Junghoon, who was covered all over with wounds , swallowed his pride and asked for Sungwoo’s help.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, please help me. The majority of people in the station are helpless. Well, I can’t do anything right now…” said Junghoon in a hoarse voice, with his eyes closed halfway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having heard him, Sungwoo boarded the helicopter silently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Junghoon said, a number of survivors were in danger of being killed in large numbers, and it was not known which force attacked Youngungpo Station. Sungwoo could not ignore Junghoon’s request in his situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There are a lot of things I want to ask you about, but I don’t think now is the right time.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m sorry.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon clearly betrayed Sungwoo’s trust. Even if it was Sungwoo who brought about the competition, it was a big mistake for Junghoon to ignore their agreed operation and rush to the boss monster from the beginning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were faced with a bigger crisis because Junghoon didn’t comply with their agreed plan to beat the monsters in the periphery before striking the boss monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo did not want to give it a pass easily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The fire helicopter carrying Sungwoo’s group and the Crusader Team took off quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since Youngdungpo Station was so close to Youido, the helicopter quickly approached the thick black smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo shouted with the rotors spinning with a roaring noise.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Never go into the smoke! Remember the bomb that hit the biker gang?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If other players breathed in the “Abyss Breath,” they would faint immediately. The pilot was no exception. In that case, the helicopter might crash even before they arrived at the station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum nodded instead of Junghoon, who was so weak at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he conveyed Sunwoo’s message to the pilot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wooooooooong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The helicopter largely bypassed the black smoke and returned to the front of the station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is crazy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Minhum swore. The situation around Youngdungpo Station, shrouded in smoke, was quite serious.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Black smoke was still soaring from all the holes in the underground roads, the station building, the department store, and other places. It was the site of a massive bioterrorism attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusader Team was aware that it was impossible to enter into the smoke because they had been already burned before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum looked at him, embarrassed, not knowing what to do. Sungwoo was looking around the station without caring about his uneasy gaze.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I can’t figure it out correctly, but looking at the color, it is weaker than the Abyss Concentrate. They must have reduced its dosage to spread it more widely.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The helicopter’s altitude gradually decreased. Those who escaped from Youngdungpo Station were gathered around the station. They seemed to number more than a thousand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When a firefighting helicopter landed around the station, those armed with crossbows rushed in droves. They were the guards at the station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Deputy! They were human beasts who attacked us here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Human beasts? Did they come back to senses?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, I saw them exchanging signals to each other.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Liberation Guild also knew that the human beasts could regain consciousness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s what I expected,” Sungwoo murmured.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s prediction was correct. There must have been a group of human beasts who hated the players and the group of mad scientists, also known as “door-to-door traders,” which he heard from the Werewolf, who had previously regained consciousness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, what should I do now?” Minhum asked, with cold sweat on his forehead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You can just keep an eye on something suspicious outside.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even the great Crusader Team was useless in the current situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo slowly walked toward Exit 1 Gate of the station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I have to catch them and find out their identity.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were still veiled, but they would be a big headache if left unchecked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Furthermore, the fact that they attacked Youngdungpo Station meant that Suwon’s village was also in danger because they, hostile to the players, mounted the attack this time while Junghoon’s main force, the Crusader Team was away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo slowly approached the station and raised his right hand. The next moment, black smoke erupted from the air on the right side. Then, the huge Bone Drake appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my God !”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, what the heck is that….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those who first witnessed the giant monster stepped back, startled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Break through the wall.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo controlled the Bone Drake to make a hole in the second floor of the outer wall of Youngdungpo Station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the giant monster lifted his foot and kicked the exterior wall a few times, the panels fell off and a pile of concrete poured down. There was a hole wide enough for one person to enter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A lot of smoke began to come out, so it was dangerous to walk into the entrance of the occupied building. Assuming that they were guarding even the windows, Sungwoo was thinking of entering it through a passage they never expected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stepped on Bone Drake’s body and disappeared into the hole and the black smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum stared blankly at the hole where Sungwoo disappeared then turned to the guard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How many people are left in the station?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know exactly, but I guess there are more than one thousand people inside. Fortunately, most of them succeeded in evacuating to Times’ Square through the underground passage.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, Deputy Commander, is it okay for that man alone to go in alone? There are still human beasts inside the building.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum nodded and said, “I also realized belatedly that if that man could not succeed, nobody else could do it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was so dark that nobody could see further than their nose because the black smoke that filled the inside hall blocked the light.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hoo-ha–”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A man stood in the awfully dense smoke. He straightened his chest and breathed in the smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is not really good. It’s not that strong.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He even had a light smile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Mana is slightly increased from the breath of the abyss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-All stats slightly increase from the breath of the abyss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Maximum number of your subordinate spirits temporarily increased by (+2).<br/><br/><br/><br/>The reason was simple. For the Necromancer, Sungwoo, this black smoke was like steroids. Furthermore, he could see through the smoke as if wearing a perspective goggle, Sungwoo walked on in the smoke without any hesitation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Inside the department store, the shelves were cleared, and many tents were installed at regular intervals. It was a living space for the survivors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On a long desk located on one side of the wall, common items such as coffee pots and rice cookers were arranged, and stainless steel plates were stacked for serving food.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Hum, it looks like Junghoon tried to put things in good order.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although Junghoon didn’t perform well during the raid process, he obviously paid special attention to the welfare of the survivors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo understood why Junghoon needed more power and came to him for help. There were too many people for him to support. He had no power enough to defend all of them, which was the reason for the current events.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, there was the sound of people talking to each other.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I heard something was smashed over there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you sure? I can’t hear right because I’m wearing a gas mask. Damn it, it’s fucking stuffy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt someone’s presence near the escalator leading to the third floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He hid behind a four-person tent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, how long does the ritual take?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know. The wizards will take care of it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>One Werewolf and one Werehog were talking to each other. Wearing black gas masks on their faces, the two human beasts walked toward where Sungwoo was hiding.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can’t really understand why those guys who luckily sucked up the priest’s brain are acting like our captains. I have hooves, but I wonder why I only ate the archer’s brain.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Still these mad scientists are better than the bad guys. I heard that these wicked bastards asked us to bring bodies like ours when they were killed. I hear they would use our bodies to make mysterious medicine…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“After we died? No matter what elixir it is said to be made with it…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo lifted his sword and cut the Werewolf’s neck. Then, he stabbed the Werehog in the chest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kerrrrrr! Who the hell are you…?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although they were human beasts, they couldn’t see through the black smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo pushed the sword in his right hand, raised the lifting crossbow with his left hand, and fired arrows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh! Uh! Huhhhhh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Werehog’s body was dropped.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have obtained 3,000 gold by hunting Werehog.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, it’s not difficult to hunt a human beast.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Until now, it was impossible for Sungwoo to fight with a human beast one on one, but thanks to his levelling up and acquiring items, he invested a lot in increasing stats, which finally paid off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, the human beasts also try to strengthen their stats by other means, so it was clear that a much stronger one would appear in the future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo went up to the third floor from where they descended. It was originally a clothing store.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- thump- </div><h2 id="chapter100">Chapter 100</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Somebody stomped around loudly. Sungwoo hid himself at the end of the escalator.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a giant bull-like ‘Werebull’ appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hmm…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He walked past the escalator, wearing a gas mask with three purification canisters and holding a couple of people on each shoulder. Then, he threw them away in the corner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it. So many out here. It looks like there are at least two hundred.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were a huge number of dead people piled up there. Three ‘Wererats’ were putting them in large bags.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are stacked up high on other floors. By the way, we have been ordered to take as many players as possible. Are they also used as experimental material?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How do you know what humans are thinking? I heard that they are going to extract something like EXP.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Extracting EXP from humans?’ Sungwoo was startled to hear that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Is that possible?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Werebull shrugged his huge shoulder.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have turned into beasts, as you know. Is there anything impossible?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Lol! Well, these days I feel like I was born as a mouse from the beginning. My life as a Wererat isn’t that bad…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in the affected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Death Response’ begins in the affected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Huh? Brother, can you see it, too? Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A white spear protruded from the neck of the Wererat who was chatting with the Werebull.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, something popped out of the dark and trampled the two human beasts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was the Werebear skeleton, one of Sungwoo’s subordinate spirits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuaaaaaah!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Werebull escaped the Werebear skeleton’s attack and struck his ribs with his horns. The Werebear skeleton didn’t suffer much damage thanks to his bone armor, but was thrown aside from the impact of his horns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, that wasn’t the end. Another Werebear skeleton popped out from another direction. The Werebull lowered his posture and kicked hard towards the Werebear’s belly with his hooves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Werebear’s heavy body collapsed from the Werebull’s kick. Then, he sensed somebody approaching him from behind, lowered his posture and grabbed the opponent’s waist quickly. He lifted the opponent in the air and struck him down on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>All kinds of bone fragments bounced out of the Werebear skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It took only a few seconds for Werebull to smash three skeletons to pieces.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, the Werebull was tougher than Sungwoo first thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>He lifted his forearm to avoid the flying javelin, then began to punch the skeleton endlessly, who he had struck down on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your subordinate spirit will return to eternal death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Werebull slowly lifted his upper body. His horns and hands were full of explosive energy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, he was using some skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuaaaaaaah! Where are you? I know who you are! Come out, Necromancer! Let’s have a duel!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Werebull shouted in anger, but there was no answer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the Werebull sensed that a huge number of skeletons were approaching him from within the dense black smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, Werewolf skeletons popped out from all sides and threw javelins at the Werebull at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuuuhhh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A huge number of long javelins were thrust into his body from his chest to thighs. Although the Werebull could fight his opponents in hand-to-hand combat, he could not withstand this kind of long distance attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, the Werebull was an outstanding fighter among his group, but he was no match for the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You mean bastard…” the Werebull shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t you know you are more mean by spraying gas?” Sungwoo retorted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Walking between the skeletons, Sungwoo stabbed his sword into his neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You earned 30,000 gold by hunting ‘2nd Stage Werebull’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘2nd Stage?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The message was new to him. Besides, he received more gold than he expected. It seemed that those human beasts who regained reason had a growth system which was different from their level.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit under your authority.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A “Werebull skeleton” with two large horns stood up. He was twice as large as a Werebear, but he seemed much larger due to the horns protruding from his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo checked the condition of those who fell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They are still alive. But if they are left untreated in the smoke for a long time, they will die.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Using ten zombies, Sungwoo began to move the survivors outside.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woooooong! Kugugugugugugu…<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a line appeared before his eyes, vibrating violently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Large Summoning Magic’ is being cast in the affected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Summon? What are they plotting now?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo remembered hearing the conversation that the wizard was conducting a certain ceremony. He didn’t know what it was, but it must be bad news.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyway, he was caught intruding into the building because of the fierce fighting with the Werebull a little while ago. So, he, accompanied by skeletons, hurried to the fourth floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the 4th floor of the department store, there was also a huge empty space where all the shelves were removed. There stood several human beasts in the middle of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were four Werebears and three Werewolves. Eight gas containers were strewn randomly, blowing out black smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pushee―<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They are responsible for the Youngdungpo Station attack! They are not here alone.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The human beast commandos installed such objects everywhere in Youngdungpo Station. Otherwise, they could not have created such a large amount of smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it, the Necromancer? As expected, that guy has not been affected by the power of the smoke of the Abyss. Our researchers will be happy to know this!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A Werewolf in a long brown coat stood up among the gas containers. He was drawing something on the floor, and it was a red magic circle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘That’s summoning magic!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Human beasts came out in droves quickly and stood in the way of Sungwoo. Obviously, they were trying to buy time to cast the summoning spell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were a total of seven human beasts. Sungwoo could easily smash them if any of them was at least more than ‘level 2’, but he couldn’t afford to enjoy the battle leisurely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Summon Death Scythe, ‘Grim Reaper’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grim Reaper retention time (00:59:58)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo grabbed the Grim Reaper. Then, a green flame burned Sungwoo’s skin and revealed his bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That changing process caused considerable pain to Sungwoo, but soon the pain numbed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It is just one hour a day. I only need to invest 5 minutes to smash these guys.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You gained the power of ‘Lich’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Increases the maximum number of your subordinate spirits by (+50).<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All stats increase by (+10).<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You can revive and regenerate the undead destroyed nearby “indefinitely” as much as the maximum number of your subordinate spirits’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What a horrible bastard!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo slowly floated into the air and raised the black scythe. At the same time, the skeletons began to advance with their eyes glowing green.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The difference between Sungwoo’s past and his present after the 1st Awakening was that the concept of “consumer war” itself disappeared. There was no need for him to save as much as possible to conserve the power of the skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Crush the skeletons’ heads first!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Since they have only bones, you can cut their spines first!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were wrong, though.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Huh? They resurrected! Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was the best time-saving strategy. The seven men managed to fight for the first several minutes, but they were torn to pieces helplessly in no time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Great! I think our researchers would be so happy if they saw this fighting. But it’s too late… Necromancer!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Werewolf, left alone, clapped his hands happily, watching his own colleagues being killed before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the magic circle drawn under his feet began to glow red.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Large Summoning Magic’ begins in the affected area!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuggugugugugugu!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The whole department store building began to shake. The ceilings cracked and the pipes protruded as if the building would collapse immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How come you are broadcasting this, you stupid bastard! You guys are watching them wasting electricity in Youido… Ahhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While the Werewolf was muttering like that, the Weretiger skeleton jumped in and bit his shoulder. Then, he dragged the Werewolf away and threw it out of the window.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Let me get out of here right now.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was dangerous to watch the situation while the building might collapse at any time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo threw himself out of the broken window. And just before hitting the floor, he slowly floated into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuuuuuh…” </div><h2 id="chapter101">Chapter 101</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            On the other hand, the Werewolf took off his gas mask, groaning in pain on the floor.<br/><br/>Soon, he smirked cynically, “Uhhhhhhhh! You humans are doomed!”<br/><br/>“What did you summon?”<br/><br/>“You’ll see a fantastic guy appear here pretty soon.”<br/><br/>A fantastic guy?<br/><br/>Kuguguuuuuung!<br/><br/>There was a loud roar inside the building. Something was collapsing and breaking.<br/><br/>Uhhhhhhhhhh!<br/><br/>The summoned monster roared. The people gathered around the station began to shudder and move back, overwhelmed and terrified by the monster’s thunderous roaring.<br/><br/>Minhum approached Sungwoo, accompanied by the patrol guards.<br/><br/>“What happened inside the building, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know yet. We’ll find out soon.”<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>The roaring inside the building grew closer. Something was about to come out of there. Then, a crack broke out on the outer wall.<br/><br/>Finally, the monster broke through the wall and came out.<br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/>-Raid Boss monster ‘Ogre Fighter’ has appeared.<br/><br/>‘Summoning the Raid Boss here?’<br/><br/>Woooooooow!<br/><br/>The giant with red skin, standing eight meters tall, landed on the ground and crushed all of the sidewalk. As if it was painful to breathe in because of the Breath of Abyss, the monster scratched his neck hard. At first glance, he looked to be in a bad mood.<br/><br/>“Uhhhhhaaaa! Can you guys who are already out of energy catch that monster? Even if you catch and kill him, you won’t be able to resurrect him as your subordinate spirit.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo burst into laughter and shouted, “You haven’t seen the broadcast until the end, right?”<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“How much did you watch the broadcast?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Such reasoning was logical. After Sungwoo hunted the Raid Boss, he used lots of energy. However, it seemed that the Werewolf did not watch the raid broadcast until the end to aim for that time. It had taken a lot of time for him to attack Youngdungpo Station, spray gas, and draw a magic circle.<br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/>Suddenly, the ground began to shake. The Werewolf turned his eyes and looked over Sungwoo’s shoulder. Then, his pupils began to grow.<br/><br/>Bone Drake, with his huge mouth open, rushed and grabbed the back of the Ogre Fighter’s neck.<br/><br/>Then, swinging his head, he threw the Ogre Fighter toward the outer wall of Youngdungpo Station.<br/><br/>Thud! Kuggugugugugu…<br/><br/>The Ogre Fighter’s body was stuck in the steel structure.<br/><br/>“Hey, we have another wonderful guy over here.”<br/><br/>These monsters didn’t know much about the Necromancer yet.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Junghoon still couldn’t do anything. Even though the safest area on the Korean peninsula he built was shrouded with the gas of death, he had difficulty moving his body.<br/><br/>He drank quality recovery potions, but he didn’t recover quickly, so it seemed like he was really on the verge of death.<br/><br/>But Sungwoo was different.<br/><br/>‘Sungwoo died then came back to life.’<br/><br/>And even after that, Sungwoo jumped into the black smoke of Youngdungpo Station, and shortly afterwards, the zombies under his control began to rescue the survivors.<br/><br/>That was definitely something that Junghoon and the Crusader Team under his control should have done.<br/><br/>“They’re coming out! Look! They’re coming out!”<br/><br/>“The Necromancer is saving people! Hey, take care of all the rescued people!”<br/><br/>Those rescued were deeply touched by Sungwoo’s rescue efforts, praising him everywhere.<br/><br/>However, Junghoon was barely opening his eyes, his body covered with a blanket.<br/><br/>‘My method was wrong.’<br/><br/>Junghoon admitted that his role had failed.<br/><br/>‘I didn’t want to build up my force because I thought I could not protect them by myself. Rather, I thought only I could save them. I was arrogant.”<br/><br/>A little later, Sungwoo broke through the windows. The Raid Boss and the Ogre Fighter came out through the broken windows.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>Watching them, even Junghoon stood up hesitantly because this was an unexpected situation.<br/><br/>However, the moment “Bone Drake” appeared and thrashed the Ogre Fighter, Junghoon expected that the situation would be controlled quite soon.<br/><br/>‘I’ve got to be strong.’<br/><br/>Junghoon looked at the Necromancer holding a black scythe.<br/><br/>‘I’ve got to be stronger than him, so that I don’t need anybody else’s help, even the Crusaders.’<br/><br/>He bit his swollen lips.<br/><br/>Kugugugugugugu―<br/><br/>The Ogre Fighter was thrown on the floor and broke through the outer wall of the first floor.<br/><br/>Sungwoo had all the skeletons on standby to prepare for the monster’s counterattack.<br/><br/>It was dangerous to follow the monster thoughtlessly.<br/><br/>Soon, the monster grabbed the broken outer wall with his thick hands, crushed the exposed steel frame and crawled out of the hole.<br/><br/>The giant monster, whose body was as solid as a stone, gasped for breath for a moment, then stared at Bone Drake.<br/><br/>The monster was angry, but at the same time, he looked confused because he didn’t know why he was suddenly summoned.<br/><br/>However, soon he revealed his fangs and charged at Bone Drake.<br/><br/>Befitting his name as the Ogre Fighter, the Ogre Fighter was bare-handed, but it seemed that there was an electric current flowing from the bracelet on his right wrist. He jumped off the ground and punched at Bone Drake’s head.<br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/>However, he was hit by Bone Drake’s tail and flew back, hitting the ceiling of the underground exit on the right.<br/><br/>Kuggugugugugugu!<br/><br/>The moment the ceiling structure fell and his body was thrown into the stairs, the skeletons jumped in at once and stabbed spears into his body.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>Two spears pierced his chest. However, the light flashed from his body for a moment, shattering and scattering three Werewolf skeletons.<br/><br/>The skeletons behind him started reassembling with the power of Lich, but those hit directly by the Ogre turned into ashes and disappeared. They perished beyond ‘resurrection.’<br/><br/>‘Damn it! That Raid Boss is really powerful!’<br/><br/>His attack was obviously as dangerous as the fire of Breath. Sungwoo found it regrettable that Bone Drake could not use his Breath.<br/><br/>‘I still have an advantage in this fighting.’<br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/>Bone Drake jumped off the ground. The Ogre Fighter raised himself.<br/><br/>Then, Bone Drake charged with his huge mouth open, while the Ogre Fighter grabbed Bone Drake’s neck with both hands and pushed.<br/><br/>It was a battle of overwhelming strength between the two monsters. Besides, something started moving behind Bone Drake’s back.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Orun and three Werewolf skeletons were ready to join Bone Drake in smashing the Ogre Fighter. They had been on Bone Drake’s back for sometime, waiting for their chance.<br/><br/>They climbed over Bone Drake’s head, and began to thrust spears into the Ogre Fighter who could not use both hands.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>Orun, clinging to the Ogre Fighter’s face, raised his blade toward his right eyeball. Even though Ogre Fighter was called a fighter, he could not stop Orun’s reckless strike.<br/><br/>The Ogre Fighter shook his head violently. When Orun wouldn’t go away, he finally took one hand that had been blocking Bone Drake and tried to catch Orun, but Orun quickly climbed over his head and hid behind his back.<br/><br/>When Ogre Fighter withdrew one of his arms from Bone Drake, he could not withstand Bone Drake’s relentless push.<br/><br/>Bone Drake’s gigantic mouth broke through the Ogre Fighter’s shield and bit its neck.<br/><br/>Then, when Bone Drake pressed him down on the floor, breaking his neck, Ogre Fighter’s knees broke down gradually.<br/><br/>Seizing the moment, all the undead charged at the Ogre Fighter, attacking him mercilessly.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>Like a herd of hyenas dismantled a fallen buffalo, they used all sorts of weapons and began to stab the Ogre Fighter.<br/><br/>The fierce tension of fighting among them disappeared as Ogre Fighter’s blood and flesh splattered everywhere.<br/><br/>-You have earned 705,000 gold by hunting the Raid Boss monster ‘Ogre Fighter’.<br/><br/>The amount of gold issued this time proved that Ogre Fighter was a low-level monster compared with Bone Drake. Sungwoo earned over 1.15 million after hunting Bone Drake.<br/><br/>But some good news was waiting for Sungwoo.<br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 16)<br/><br/>‘Wow, what a great EXP reward!’<br/><br/>Immediately after reaching level 15, he reached level 16 by hunting two Raid Bosses.<br/><br/>Of course, it wasn’t that easy, considering that he died in the process.<br/><br/>-Choose your level up card.<br/><br/>Stats (random)<br/><br/>Skill (random)<br/><br/>Item (random)<br/><br/>Other (random)<br/><br/>Response of death (confirmed)<br/><br/>‘Oh, I see the skill item finally!’<br/><br/>It was the first time that the ‘confirmed’ skill appeared as the No. 5 item. It was a skill he already had, namely ‘The Response of Death’. Sungwoo chose the item. </div><h2 id="chapter102">Chapter 102</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">

No mana is generated for 5 minutes after an attack.<br/><br/>* If someone without mana wears it, it has a waiting time of 24 hours after use one time without any power consumption.<br/><br/>Since Sungwoo experienced its firepower before, Sungwoo knew that it contained a skill with the potential of inflicting tremendous damage, but there was one fatal weakness in it.<br/><br/>It was none other than mana. Using all the mana available?<br/><br/>‘I now see why these things have the hero grade.’<br/><br/>Mana was essential for the operation of the skeletons. In other words, it is an unsuitable item Sungwoo.<br/><br/>However, it was fortunate that there was a condition of use for “objects without mana” below it.<br/><br/>‘Okay, I can put it on the Ogre Fighter skeleton.’<br/><br/>Since the Ogre Fighter skeleton is an ‘object without mana’, Sungwoo obtained a skeleton that can use a skill.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the Werewolf in a brown coat stood aghast, with his long snout wide open, at the appearance of the Ogre Fighter resurrected as a skeleton.<br/><br/>“No way! Crazy! What the hell are you doing, Necromancer?”<br/><br/>“You said you brought a friend. Why? Can’t he be my friend?”<br/><br/>“Don’t play on words!”<br/><br/>“Sure, no punning, of course.”<br/><br/>Pik! Pik!<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo fired at his thigh. The Werewolf fell, screaming in pain, and Sungwoo slowly walked toward him and shouted, “Hey, I think we need to introduce each other.”<br/><br/>The monster was shuddering all over at that moment. It was a seizure. Sungwoo pushed his body over with his foot.<br/><br/>“Krrrrrrr…Don’t make fun of me! Cough!”<br/><br/>The monster’s eyes rolled back as hefoamied at the mouth. Then, he twisted his whole body and stiffened. It was poison.<br/><br/>“Damn it! He poisoned himself for fear of interrogation.”<br/><br/>Minhum stomped his feet as if he was angry at that, for he would have interrogated the monster to find out the mastermind behind the attack. Although his main base Youngdungpo Station was attacked, he could not mount a counterattack because he could not find the mastermind.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo knew there was another way to find it out.<br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/>The Werewolf skeleton in a brown coat was resurrected and approached Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Then, a familiar message appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/>-You can check the ‘fragments of the memory’ of the dead.<br/><br/>It had been a while since he read somebody’s memory. He wasn’t sure how this mechanism worked, but it’s obvious that the designers of this game deliberately presented fragmented puzzles to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Just like a new quest was given when he read the memory of the “Vampire Branch Chief” in the past, the memory fragments gave some sort of hint as if to guide Sungwoo in some direction.<br/><br/>Soon, the Werewolf’s memory was reproduced vividly like a video.<br/><br/>‘Where is it? This is a subway transfer gate I’ve seen a few times.’<br/><br/>It was dark, so it was difficult for him to identify the location, but it was a familiar place.<br/><br/>‘Sindorim Station.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately identified the location. Sindorim Station was one of the worst transfer centers in the metropolitan area. Sungwoo had experienced passing through that station several times in the past.<br/><br/>Now, he was familiar with this face. It was a bull familiar to him, the ‘Werebull’ who became Sungwoo’s subordinate spirit after he was defeated in the department store.<br/><br/>Then, a white Werewolf appeared right behind the Werebull.<br/><br/>Clad in black scale armor, he was holding a cane. His appearance looked quite unusual.<br/><br/>He approached the Werewolf in the brown coat.<br/><br/>“Turn off your smartphone. Soon, we will enter the enemy’s territory.”<br/><br/>The Werewolf turned off his cell phone and put it in his pocket. That’s why he could not watch the broadcast until the end.<br/><br/>“Oh, it’s really getting interesting from now on…The Crusader Team was on the defensive. Damn it!”<br/><br/>When he looked back, grumbling like that, there were a dozen or so human beasts coming up behind his back. They were carrying heavy gas cans and wearing gas masks.<br/><br/>“Well, handsome wolf brother.”<br/><br/>“I told you not to call me like that.”<br/><br/>“Anyway, brother, I heard that attacking Youngdungpo wasn’t necessarily intended to smash the players.”<br/><br/>“I don’t know about it.”<br/><br/>“Are you sure? How come you don’t know about it? Even I heard about it.”<br/><br/>The white Werewolf stopped at that moment.<br/><br/>“As the captain said from the beginning, destroying Youndungpo was something we had to do someday, and now is a great opportunity. So, shut up. The enemy camp is close to us.”<br/><br/>“Youido?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“I heard those crazy scientists forced our captain to accept their demands, saying they would build a research center in Youido. They even threatened him.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo focused on that conversation. Youido? An important piece of information related to Youido came to his mind.<br/><br/>It was none other than ‘Korean Server Bad Ending-2’.<br/><br/>“It seems like you have heard lots of nonsense since you have been staying with them these days.”<br/><br/>“Well, I don’t think the captain is the leader of our organization. It’s my impression that he fell into some fascism after he began to mingle with those crazy scientists. I feel it’s really funny when I talk to them.”<br/><br/>“Hey, let me warn you. Shut your mouth. Let’s keep moving.”<br/><br/>Having said that, the white Werewolf went ahead.<br/><br/>“Why should you try to keep it from me? They are openly talking about it. Brother, let me tell you something very interesting from now on. Right now in Youido…”<br/><br/>“Stop!”<br/><br/>The video ended there.<br/><br/>Sungwoo again stood in front of Youngdungpo Station.<br/><br/>‘There are two pieces of information. One of their main strongholds is in Sindorim. And the reason they attacked Youngdungpo Station is because they want to occupy Youido?’<br/><br/>The second piece of information was still like a puzzle. He had to go to Sindorim in order to put together the puzzle.<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked back at Minhum.<br/><br/>“Who is in Sindorim?”<br/><br/>It was only one stop between Sindorim and Youngdungpo. So, it was strange that he didn’t know who was in Sindorim.<br/><br/>“Sindorim? There’s a group of survivors who were stationed there ten days ago, but they don’t want to contact us. Very unusual.”<br/><br/>The Liberation Guild was growing a mass of cancer close by.<br/><br/>“If you can enter the station when the smoke disappears, please check again from the underground passage. It looks like they entered through it.”<br/><br/>“Really? Then, where are you going…?”<br/><br/>The black sickle and skeletons scattered into the air.<br/><br/>“I am going to step on the tails of those beasts.”<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Sindorim Station was the center of transportation where Line 1 and Line 2 subways intersected. Since the game started, there have been a huge number of people gathered there.<br/><br/>In other words, there were a huge number of victims.<br/><br/>“I settled here because it’s near Youngdungpo. So, it’s good because there are so many corpses. Besides, there is a surplus of experimental materials, too.”<br/><br/>The man with blue tape on his eye glasses looked at the blue water tank with a happy expression. It was a water tank that could be easily seen from the rooftop, but what’s different from other tanks was that there were a lot of red symbols on its surface. Then, a Wererat climbed up the ladder and threw a naked female body into it.<br/><br/>“By the way, director, don’t you think we need more freezers? Just tell me, and I’ll get more of them. The smell of rotting corpses is coming up from the underground tunnel.”<br/><br/>The man called the director clicked his tongue and said, “Get used to it. If you get used to it, you can endure anything. Especially, your sense of smell adapts to anything easily.”<br/><br/>“Well, in my case, I can smell better since I have become a human beast…”<br/><br/>Without hearing him out, the director turned around. There was disillusionment in his face. </div><h2 id="chapter103">Chapter 103</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “Tsut, tsu…You damn beasts! You don’t even know that the smell is from your body. By the way, you want to be a human again, right?”<br/><br/>“Of course.”<br/><br/>“Now that our head office has started a research test, you had better apply for it.”<br/><br/>“Apply for the research test?”<br/><br/>The Wererat touched his neck, quite embarrassed. His neck was covered with a leash made of iron.<br/><br/>“Right. As you know, they usually start testing on a rat first.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>As if he was satisfied with his own joke, the director approached his desk.<br/><br/>On top of it were objects such as flasks and equipment, commonly found in an ordinary laboratory, slimy liquid contained in a strange orc skull and a goblin head with electrodes.<br/><br/>He slowly lifted the orc skull full of green, slimy liquid.<br/><br/>“Don’t just take it as a joke. Think about it carefully. What’s the point of living as a human beast? In particular, rats are looked down upon among human beasts. Even if they succeed in developing the medicine, it’ll take a lot of time for Wererats like you to get the benefit. How long can a rat live?”<br/><br/>“Ah, yes! Thank you for caring about me.”<br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/>Then, the door opened and a man in a gray helmet entered.<br/><br/>“Research Director! Something appeared outside!”<br/><br/>“Hey, you caught me by surprise! I almost spilled slime on my hand!”<br/><br/>“Oh, sorry! Something is outside now…”<br/><br/>“Damn it! Why are you trying to disturb me when I’m trying to do the eighteenth test? Didn’t you see the sign on the door that I’m experimenting now?”<br/><br/>“I know, but something is outside!”<br/><br/>“Tell me quickly, you son of a bitch! You keep repeating the same thing.”<br/><br/>The man in the helmet swallowed and opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“A dinosaur has appeared!”<br/><br/>The director turned to the Wererat to hear that.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this? Hey, do you have a Weretyrannosaurus among your race ?”<br/><br/>“Pardon? I haven’t heard of anything like that.”<br/><br/>The director could not figure out what’s going on, but it was definitely an emergency situation.<br/><br/>As the head of this research facility, the director needed to check out.<br/><br/>“Damn it. Show me!”<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>Led by the man, the director headed to the ground floor. A dozen guards were coming and going absent-minedly, guarding the building.<br/><br/>“Oh, this news is just in. I’ve received a radio that says that Operation Youngdungpo has failed.”<br/><br/>“What? Damn it!”<br/><br/>“Then, is this related to that…”<br/><br/>At that moment, somebody shouted, “He’s coming!”<br/><br/>“Ahhhhh! Run away!”<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>Sunlight poured into the gloomy interior as some parts of the ceiling were torn apart.<br/><br/>And a giant head popped in.<br/><br/>It was a real dinosaur.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>“Damn it! It was real! Weretyrannosaurus?”<br/><br/>Startled, the director immediately turned around and started descending the stairs.<br/><br/>“Was it real? What? Is Bone Drake in Youido? I wish I hadn’t come out here. Stop him right now! Hey, pack my luggage!”<br/><br/>But the Wearrat was standing at the end of the stairs, looking somewhere.<br/><br/>He glanced into the sunlight coming in as the ceiling was torn and shadows fell in lines. To put it more accurately, he was looking somewhere into the shadow.<br/><br/>“Huh? What the heck is he doing? Hey, son of a bitch!”<br/><br/>When the director violently shouted, the Wererat blinked as if he was embarrassed.<br/><br/>“Oh, I just smelled an unfamiliar smell suddenly…”<br/><br/>“Are you boasting that you can smell well now? Come up here quickly! We can’t stop the monster because nobody is here.”<br/><br/>The Wererat was forced to turn and descend the stairs. However, he couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable while going down.<br/><br/>They went back to the lab, turned on the dimly lit lamps, and began picking up important items. The two were busy moving and packing something in the darkness.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>At that moment, the Wererat again sensed something strange. Frowning, he flared his nostrils.<br/><br/>Sniffing– Sniffing–<br/><br/>Then he stopped sniffing, pulled a dagger from his waist and aimed at the shadow at the entrance.<br/><br/>“Director, get out of here now!”<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>What the Wererat was staring at was in the shadows cast by a light lamp.<br/><br/>And somebody walked out of that shadow. He was wearing a dark green robe, armed with bone armor. He lifted the crossbow in his left hand.<br/><br/>“What are you! Uh, when did you come in? Didn’t you see the sign “Off Limits to Outsiders?” on the door?”<br/><br/>“I came for a refund because something was wrongly delivered to me.”<br/><br/>The director lifted his glasses at that and examined the man carefully, “Refund? What kind of refund?”<br/><br/>“It was amazing stuff.”<br/><br/>At that moment, screams began to come from the hallway outside the lab.<br/><br/>They already broke through the lab.<br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/>With a tremendous roar, the ceiling shook. The only two lights on the ceiling were trembling violently.<br/><br/>Then, the ceiling behind the director collapsed and something huge fell.<br/><br/>It was an ogre skeleton, a giant monster of only bones.<br/><br/>“That monster…”<br/><br/>“You got it now? You sent the item to the wrong address.”<br/><br/>What the director never expected came back.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>They were the so-called door-to-door vendors.<br/><br/>Sungwoo knew the existence of the mad scientists early on.<br/><br/>They were responsible for making the unknown raw materials, such as the “Human Beast Transformation Ampoule” and the “Abyssal Concentrate.” Sungwoo also knew they were planning to expel the players in cooperation with some human beasts. He had a rough idea of what was going on, but he never expected that they were deeply involved in making such a detailed plan to attack Youngdungpo Station to occupy Youido, or that their research facility was located right here in the basement of Sindorim Station.<br/><br/>‘Damn crazy guys.’<br/><br/>When he found out their identity, Sungwoo really felt bad. He felt like he witnessed the unsanitary manufacturing process of convenient store food. Of course, what he found in the lab was much more terrible than that.<br/><br/>‘As it was written in the item description, they use humans as raw material.’<br/><br/>Four water tanks were lined up in the dark basement. In addition, pulleys and chains were installed on the ceiling so that bodies such as humans, human beasts and monsters could be placed and removed from the water tank at any time.<br/><br/>He couldn’t figure out what was in those tanks now, but some dark liquid was boiling and stank to high heaven so as nothing he ever smelled before.<br/><br/>Blue waterproof vinyl was laid on the floor in one corner, and there were pieces of corpses piled up according to their types.<br/><br/>After looking at it, Sungwoo turned his head to the director. Watching the fallen Ogre, the director made eye contact with Sungwoo with an embarrassed expression.<br/><br/>“How does it feel to have been caught enjoying this kind of bad taste?”<br/><br/>The director chuckled at Sungwoo’s question, and retorted, “Bad taste? Hahaha! Well, the ignorant who don’t even know the difference between humans and animals are sneering at us. This is an experiment!”<br/><br/>“Really? I guess you will regret running your mouth like that right now.”<br/><br/>Pik!<br/><br/>An arrow was stuck in his thigh.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>The director stepped back hesitantly, then opened his mouth wide, seeing blood spilling out of his thigh.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhh! Shit! You son of a bitch!”<br/><br/>“See, you are only shooting your mouth off!”<br/><br/>The director stepped back, limping, then leaned against the water tank. The boiling liquid spilled slightly over his shoulders.<br/><br/>Cheeeeeeel!<br/><br/>An unidentified liquid began to dissolve his gown, but he rummaged through his inner pocket without caring about it. He took out something.<br/><br/>Then, the Wererat standing in front of him was shocked to see it, his eyes opened wide.<br/><br/>“Director?”<br/><br/>It was an unknown switch.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuh! Thanks for your work until now. Let me put you to good use.”<br/><br/>Click―<br/><br/>With the sound of the button, the metal collar of the Wererat contracted instantly. At the same time, Wererat twisted.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuk! Kaaaaaaak!”<br/><br/>Wererat complained of extreme pain, then raised his nails and scratched his neck. Then, with his red eyes glowing, he ran toward Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/>Sungwoo fired the repeating crossbow randomly. As his “shadow alter ego” was formed, the arrows firing from the crossbow were twice as many as before.<br/><br/>Kuaaaaaah!<br/><br/>However, the arrows couldn’t stop Wererat’s reckless charge. It seemed like his metal leash was embedded with some device because he rushed at Sungwoo, even after he was hit by a dozen arrows.<br/><br/>Sungwoo twisted his body to the side and narrowly avoided Wererat’s attack.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The Wererat struck the iron door behind Sungwoo. The door was folded in half and bounced into the hallway.<br/><br/>‘It’s not as strong as Bone Drake’s tail, but it would have hurt quite a bit if I was hit.’ </div><h2 id="chapter104">Chapter 104</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/>Escaping to one side, Sungwoo kept firing arrows. Even though arrows entered all over his body, he charged at Sungwoo recklessly.<br/><br/>Now that Sungwoo avoided Wererat’s initial attack, the monster’s reckless charge was no more a threat to him because the resurrected Ogre Fighter skeleton was right there with him.<br/><br/>The Wearat was kicked by the Ogre Fighter, then thrust into the wall and dropped.<br/><br/>-You have earned 13,000 gold by hunting a ‘Mutated Wererat’.<br/><br/>The modifier ‘mutated’ before the Wererat was obviously the result of their strange experiment.<br/><br/>“Krrrrrrrrr…”<br/><br/>When the director failed to deal a fatal blow to Sungwoo, he took something else out.<br/><br/>Sungwoo knew what it was. It was a “Human Beast Transformation Ampoule” previously used by Sgt. First Class Kang. Obviously, the director thought of transforming into a human beast and running away.<br/><br/>“Kaaaaaaaaaaah!”<br/><br/>At that moment, he had his hands ripped off by the Weretiger skeleton that came through a hole in the ceiling. Sungwoo made the skeleton throw his hands into the water tank.<br/><br/>Splash!<br/><br/>“Next, I’m going to tear off your arms, then your lower body, and your head and throw them into the tank. By the way, did you swallow poison?”<br/><br/>Froth began to flow from the director’s mouth.<br/><br/>“I know it’s too late. Cough! The reason I sent that Wererat after you was because I wanted to swallow all the poison. Kuuuuuuh! Necromancer…My colleagues are going to make you their great test material.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded casually and said, “Good job. You don’t need to repeat it.”<br/><br/>“What? Why, why are you laughing at me? …Kuuuuk!”<br/><br/>“You will never know.”<br/><br/>His body tilted.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was thinking of something at that moment. All he had to do was to resurrect him as a skeleton and read the fragments of his memory.<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t change him to a skeleton.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Why? Seongwoo, who was thinking about it for a moment, pulled out the Ownerless Sword, then struck his right forearm.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>He began to scream and roll on the floor. The Weretiger skeleton standing next to Sungwoo picked up the severed arm and threw it into the water tank.<br/><br/>Splash!<br/><br/>“Don’t pretend to be dead in front of me!”<br/><br/>“Argh! Ahhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>“The more you delay your death, the more you are going to annoy me…”<br/><br/>Without saying anything more, Sungwoo stabbed the sword into his chest.<br/><br/>Killing him at once was more comfortable than blackmail or interrogation.<br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/>-You can check the ‘memory fragments’ of the dead.<br/><br/>Soon, a video was played.<br/><br/>It was a clean and spacious conference room. The owner of the memory, the “director,” sat face to face with a man with pomaded hair.<br/><br/>The man said, “The reason I’m going to dispatch you to the branch is simple. Go there and produce “A gas” as much as possible at the site.”<br/><br/>“That’s my specialty. It’s me who has developed almost everything, right? I’m not good in other fields, but as far as “A gas” is concerned, I’m the expert. It’s like my child. So, you want me to produce a lot and blow away Youngdungpo, right?”<br/><br/>The man, shaking his head, rested his chin on his interlocked hands, “Well, you can produce A gas only enough to get rid of those annoying players. Leave the rest to the human beast wizards. They will send the Raid Bosses, who are in custody now, to Youngungpo through Teleport magic. Three of them in a row.”<br/><br/>Three Raid Bosses? And they’re in custody?<br/><br/>Sungwoo focused on the conversation that followed.<br/><br/>“Pardon? How can you leave this important operation to those suspicious guys?”<br/><br/>The man with pomade hair said with a sigh, “Be careful. Without them, we can’t go ahead with our plan. In particular, the “Sasu” human beast is stronger than the top three in the player rankings. You have to borrow their power unconditionally.”<br/><br/>Considering its meaning and context, Sasu seemed to refer to a human beast. Then, how can he definitely conclude he is stronger than the top three players?<br/><br/>Human beasts were those who didn’t draw cards, and it would have taken quite a while for them to regain their will. Based on Sungwoo’s calculations, they couldn’t be stronger than top players. ‘Is there something I don’t know?’<br/><br/>There are always variables in this game. Obviously, a quest must have been given to the human beasts and scientists and helped them surpass others.<br/><br/>“Well, hearing what you say, I want to dismantle them quickly and make them into potions. Got it.”<br/><br/>“Anyway, our goal is not just to expel the players. Keep that in mind. You could burn the whole house if you set fire to catch bugs.”<br/><br/>“I know, of course. New humankind in Youido! Just thinking about it makes my heart full. I’m having a hard time like this because I believe that my children will be able to be superpowered people.”<br/><br/>As Sungwoo suspected, their goal was occupying Youido, but Youido was also the goal. However, the concept of “new humankind” emerged.<br/><br/>Since it was an important place, the fragmented information kept coming in. Sungwoo suspected it might be related to their ‘exclusive quest’.<br/><br/>Right at that moment an old-fashioned door opened behind the man, and someone entered.<br/><br/>‘It’s the same guy.’<br/><br/>He was the white Werewolf who Sungwoo saw in the memories of the Werewolf in the brown coat. He was wearing black scaled armor and a cane just like he did before the terrorist attack in Youngdungpo.<br/><br/>‘This guy must be an important person.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo paid close attention to the white Werewolf.<br/><br/>“He is coming now. The third grand wizard of Sasu.”<br/><br/>When the director spoke sarcastically, the white Werewolf approaching from a distance shook his head.<br/><br/>“Wrong. I am not a wizard.”<br/><br/>“Did you hear me at that distance? Man, these human beasts have really good hearing.”<br/><br/>Unlike the director, the pomaded man was polite. He bowed to the white Werewolf and beckoned to the empty chair.<br/><br/>“Nice to see you here. Please sit down.”<br/><br/>“Thank you. Everyone thinks I’m a wizard, looking at my cane. I think you, Kwangsu, feel the same way. Please take a look at me. I’m this type of person.”<br/><br/>The white Werewolf stretched his palm toward the director.<br/><br/>“Are you a human? Uh?”<br/><br/>Then, a blue light flowed from his fingers and was absorbed into the director’s chest. The director pushed the chair back in surprise, and swept down the top of his shirt.<br/><br/>“Uh? What did you do to me now?”<br/><br/>“You have to go a long way with me, but we need insurance to protect each other. That will protect both you and me. We can send a message to each other when we’re in danger…”<br/><br/>At that moment the video stopped playing, and the screen became blurry as if there was white noise.<br/><br/>– Caution! It’s a state of interference due to “psychometry”!<br/><br/>‘What the heck is this?’<br/><br/>When a strange message appeared before his eyes, the atmosphere in the video somewhat changed.<br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, the pomaded man turned into powder and disappeared. In an incomprehensible situation, only the white Werewolf was left behind, but there was a blue light coming out of his eyes.<br/><br/>Then, the white Werewolf opened his mouth slowly.<br/><br/>“…Necromancer.”<br/><br/>What is this situation?<br/><br/>“…Huh?”<br/><br/>Furthermore, even Sungwoo could speak. He realized that this phenomenon in front of him was no longer happening in memory, but in real time.<br/><br/>Yes. This was possible because of his skill.<br/><br/>“I thought I came to the Sindorim branch more quickly than I thought after occupying Youngdungpo, but you used this kind of trick. How could you read the corpse’s memory?”<br/><br/>The white Werewolf asked.<br/><br/>“Ah, I thought it very strange that your Sindorim branch was empty. Is your main unit somewhere else?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/>Because Sungwoo attacked the Sindorim Research Center without delay, the white Werewolf was absent at the moment.<br/><br/>The white Werewolf didn’t answer. As if he didn’t want to talk for a long time, he just stared at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Don’t stand in my way and leave Youngdungpo. Our fight is going to be long if you stay here. It’s our victory anyway. Don’t be mistaken that you are stronger because you are ranked at the top of the players’ rankings.”<br/><br/>“So, who are you?”<br/><br/>“We are members of the ‘Evolution Society’. Remember our names. The current humankind that you know will perish.”<br/><br/>The video ended there.<br/><br/>“Whew …”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was faced with an unexpected situation. Should he call “psychometry” a superpower as the name suggests? Obviously, that man was formidable.<br/><br/>However, there was something else that Sungwoo had to take care of right now.<br/><br/>‘What I should consider the most with respect to the fragmented memories is the information about the Raid Bosses. Are there three?’ </div><h2 id="chapter105">Chapter 105</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The pomaded man in that memory said he was going to summon three raid bosses in a row.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, since he failed in his first attempt, it’s highly likely that he would change the plan, but Sungwoo had to deal with it anyway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He rummaged through the director’s gown for additional information, but he couldn’t get anything. He then headed to the table covered in experimental tools. He swept all unnecessary items off the desk.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, there was only one map left on the desk.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What is it a map of?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a map of the metropolitan area. And on the map, some areas were marked with red markers A, B, and C.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What do they have in common?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>What caught his eyes first was ‘A Youido’. However, there was marked X on the top of Youido.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he noticed ‘B Bucheon,’ which was precisely written as ‘Sosa-dong’. ‘C Anyang’ was written as ‘Beomgye Station’ in the parentheses. The last two places were marked with an ‘O’ and an arrow was directed towards Youngdungpo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Yes, this is the very place where the raid bosses are located.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo interpreted the context involving the three Raid Bosses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon’s team already launched the attack against the Raid Boss in Youido, so they could not use him there. So, they planned to summon the other two Raid Bosses to Youngdungpo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And one of them was the ‘Ogre Fighter.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>If Sungwoo hadn’t read the memory, he might have overlooked it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, it means that there might be one left.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The pomaded man in the memory said that the human beast wizards were ‘detaining’ the raid bosses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘That also means that another force of the Evolution Society is right here.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo folded the map and put it in his pocket.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He thought he just found a very precious map.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo returned to Youngdungpo, he asked Minhum a favor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Check the community and find information related to Pucheon or Anyang.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What kind of information do you want? By the way, what happened? I wonder if you found anything useful…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, let me discuss it with Junghoon, so please take care of my request. Any information about a Raid Boss or a giant monster.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, let me try to find it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo sat face to face with Junghoon in a cafe in the shopping district in front of Youngdungpo Station. The station was still off limits to outsiders while the investigation and inspection was underway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please go ahead,” said Junghoon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonghoon’s face was still haggard. There was no more majestic aura around him. Sungwoo didn’t know it, but Junghoo was completely disarmed, so his skill, ‘War Hero’s Aura’ was not activated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They will mount another attack against Youngdungpo Station.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoo was calm. It wasn’t a big surprise.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who is behind this attack plan?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Evolution Society.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ve never heard of it…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know anything other than that, but I know some more important facts.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon looked at him silently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What they are targeting is not Youngdungpo Station. In other words, the Liberation Guild is not their target.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then why did they attack us…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Their target is Youido.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is there anything that comes to your mind when you think of Youido?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon blinked his half-closed eyelids, then opened his eyes wide.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You mean the Fallen?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, I’m suspecting them, but I don’t have any specific evidence.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The fallen world tree growing in Youido devoured all living things on the Korean Peninsula.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was the scene of ‘Prophecy Stone Bad Ending-2’. It’s a terrible ending that should never, ever happen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon’s face was distorted in an instant, but he recovered his calm again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He opened his mouth with a pale yet calm expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Regardless of whether this is true or not, we have to deal with them anyway and we must prevent it at all costs.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think so, too.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon raised his head and looked into his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He seemed to be determined on something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo?” Junghoon said, looking straight into his eyes. “Can I hire you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was something Sungwoo never expected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What did you say?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please defend Youngdungpo. You are the only one who can stand up to the power of the Abyss so far, so I will pay you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head instead of replying. There was Youngdungpo Station that had been devastated. Its outer walls collapsed terribly, and black smoke was still rising in several places.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Until recently, it was the headquarters of the Liberation Guild, the best survivor group on the Korean peninsula who were commanding the allies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon had managed to defend Youngdungpo until now, but he could not be sure whether he could continue to defend it without Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head and looked at him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How much are you going to buy me for?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ll give you one million gold or more in the future.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>One million gold was a huge amount that he could obtain when he caught the Raid Boss in Youido.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, there were a lot of players in Youngdungpo, and he had some surplus funds because he was collecting gold from the guild members to operate the Liberation Guild. He clearly expressed he would readily invest the money.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“In other words, I’ll fully cover the cost. So, please get rid of the monsters completely.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo knew that he had another plan, and he needed to use Sungwoo to realize the plan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Junghoon is not my enemy. Right now, the immediate task is to break the Evolution Society. So, let me make use of his offer.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo decided to smash the Evolution Society after hunting the Raid Boss with Junghoon’s financial support.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>After talking with Junghoon, Sungwoo visited Hanho and Jisu. They were mixed in with the Crusader Team on standby. When Hanho noticed Sungwoo, he got out of the group and approached him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, those guys really love to mingle with me. They’re talking too much.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Have you already made friends with them?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, they are being friendly to me as if they have formed some kind of friendship after fighting together, but they are still wedded to the thinking that their commander is the strongest.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought that they were under the influence of Junghoon’s exclusive skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“And the male members are hell bent on winning over Jisu’s heart, cracking jokes like ‘Oh, your red training sweatpants really look good on you’…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Hanho left her behind in the group, it seemed that she was really having a hard time among them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, did you see the community, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nope, I had no time to check it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho smiled like a pervert and said, “Man, there was a big fuss out there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was referring to the Necromancer’s successful hunting of the Boss Raid in a dramatic reversal of his weak position.<br/><br/><br/><br/>All the scenes of his heroic fighting were broadcasted live across the country.His awakening from death and becoming Lich with the 1st awakening and his raising Bone Drake were so overwhelming.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As Junghoon intended, delivering the message of hope to the survivors was a success, although Sungwoo, not Junghoon, claimed the credit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you know that they have formed a fan club?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? I’m embarrassed…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t be surprised. Even Orun has a fan club now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho turned on his smartphone, turned on the player guidebook application, and opened the ranking page.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dr. Zero? That guy reached level 15, then climbed to the third place in the rankings. Youngdungpo Prosecutor is pushed to fourth place. Man, he has almost lost his face.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo’s eyebrows wriggled momentarily. ID’DOCTOR-000′ was only No. 4 player because of Sungwoo and Junghoon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘His ID is Dr?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>That ID bothered Sungwoo. Given that there were some more IDs similar to that, they were obviously quite a large group.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Evolution Society.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It’s highly likely that they were its members because the ID ‘Dr.’ was a nickname that perfectly matched the image of a mad scientist. If Sungwoo’s reasoning was correct, it meant that they were growing rapidly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Besides, there are human beasts not compiled in the rankings. They may have a lot of power.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Minhum approached him and said, “An unknown object was found inside the station building. The smoke kept coming out because of it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo made a queer expression, he continued, “Well, it’s letting out powerful breath of Abyss. When I approach it, it even penetrates my gas mask. It seems that we can’t get rid of it without your help, Sungwoo.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>An object that is letting out the breath of Abyss?<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that the Evolution Society left behind one more gift. </div><h2 id="chapter106">Chapter 106</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>It was inevitable for Minhum to ask for Sungwoo’s help because only he, the Necromancer, could touch the object.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though the Crusader Team member, wearing a gas mask, got close to it, he collapsed as soon as he touched it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stood in front of the object.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first glance, it looked like a super-sized thermos bottle. The object constantly emitted black smoke, even though it started letting it out a long time ago. It must have been different from the gas cylinder that contained the breath of the Abyss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s the object in question. Are you okay?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wearing a gas mask, Minhum asked, standing at a distance. Sungwoo did not answer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, he felt okay. He felt good.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It’s the breath of a much deeper Abyss.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt the smell was the same he had first experienced in the school gym. Of course, since he went through the 1st awakening already, he could not expect a tremendous increase in stats like before, just like the dosage of medicine for children was different from that for adults.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Refined Abyss Breath (Jar)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Class: Unknown<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Player manufacturing<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: When the lid is opened, it emits ‘Abyssal Breath’. (34% left)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: Put it in the locker of the less fortunate guy and open it. (Manufacturer’s skills)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, there were many types of less fortunate people. Sungwoo’s opponents opened the wrong locker door.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I can’t use it indefinitely, but it must be quite useful.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He used the item called ‘Abyss Concentrate’ quite usefully.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He reached out and closed the lid.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘Abyssal Breath’ stopped emitting. (34% left)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The smoke in the periphery gradually faded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You have succeeded in stopping it!” Minhum shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me take this jar,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo approached him, holding the jar, Minhum stepped back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure. Who would covet it other than a psychopath…Thank you,” said Minhum.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, did you confirm what I requested of you?” Sungwoo asked him to look into the details of the Raid Boss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I was so absent-minded with this. Since you got rid of this object, let me check it out immediately.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded and went out of the station. Jisu and Hanho stood at the entrance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that they were freed from the Crusader Team when they were dispatched to the station for a security check.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sunwoo, you are freely going around without us. Since you are not around us, they are eager to win over Jisu’s heart. Do you know how stressed out she was?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I never told you not to follow me. But if you want to follow me, you have to carry lots of antidote with you,” Sungho replied.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, what if you suddenly die? We would have nobody to rely on. Do you know how sad she was when you disappeared all of a sudden? She cried…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he said that, Jisu stared at Hanho. Sensing her murderous look, he shut up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho, please stop that bullshit,” Jisu shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haha, I’m sorry I’m shooting my mouth off like this. Uh, sister Jisu?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu abruptly turned, really annoyed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why? What’s wrong with you?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, she might kill me if I say this to you. She cast a murderous glance at me anyway.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho scratched his head and opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, when you were killed by the opponent’s Breath attack, Jisu was so shocked that she teared up. I joked about that several times, so she was mad at me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did she?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As far as he knew, Jius was not the type who could be sentimental or tear up. She was a steel-hearted woman.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Isn’t it you who cried, Hanho?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Me? When you died? No way. I cried when Orun died. So, please take good care of Orun. Even if you died, don’t forget to leave Orun with us.”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>When Sungwoo pondered over it for a moment, he thought Hanho would save Orun first if he and Orun were in danger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon was sitting alone in an empty cafe. On the table next to him was thick metal armor and a longsword. It seemed like he was completely disarmed after a long time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tok, tok, tok, tok!<br/><br/><br/><br/>He tapped his finger on the table, lost in thought. Sungwoo’s voice played in his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, your hiring me is another matter. Junghoon, you owe a lot to me. Don’t try to forget your promise to give me 1 million gold. I was really disappointed in you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, Sungwoo stood up. Sungwoo pressured him hard to gain the upper hand in future negotiations between them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And his pressure paid off nicely. Junghoon was now feeling pressured a lot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If I take issue with his pressure openly, people’s perception of me will be negative very quickly. I won’t surpass him in force or in public perception.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In short, he was at a disadvantage even in political fighting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoo slowly raised his head and looked into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Exclusive Quest]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Title: Hero, prepare for the sacred war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Type: Fostering<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Goal: To train 30 ‘Crusaders’ at level 10 or higher<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Reward: 1st Awakening, Exclusive Skill<br/><br/><br/><br/>*You have witnessed Hell on this earth before anyone else. You must fight to be a hero with extraordinary power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hero, who has arisen out of chaos! Enlighten the foolish and build an army to walk into hell!<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You must achieve this goal before the “world tree” grows on this earth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Your choice affects your ‘destiny’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon was given an “exclusive quest”. Based on his investigation, this was a phenomenon that only appeared in occupational groups with 4 stars or more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, the exclusive quest is a trial as well as a privilege given only to those who choose 4-star and 5-star cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘That is why I have to achieve it quickly. That’s how I can get ahead of those with 5 stars by competing with them. But train 30 Crusaders? Six of them were killed during this raid, so there are only 14 left. Besides, train those who have level 10 or higher?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a very difficult quest, with his 1st awakening depending on it. But it was obvious that Sungwoo already achieved something like this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I must achieve it by all means, and I can do it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonghoon stood up, as if he was determined. Then, he put on his white full plate armor and the longsword on his back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A little later Minhum came up to the cafe to report to Junghoon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Deputy, we’re going hunting again, starting tomorrow. This is a hunt for levelling up before we start the raid.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Startled, Minhum asked, “Really? Commander, it will take quite a while to restore the station. I think it’s rather premature to go hunting before we restore the station…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“While we are restoring the station, someone is getting ahead of us. Then, we have no choice but to be defeated again.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, Junghoon’s ranking was pushed a step further down No. 4 in the players’ rankings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, his overwhelming reputation that he had built up until now collapsed. In order to recover his lost prestige and reputation, he had to level up more than anything else to move up to a higher ranking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Of course, I am not saying that we should leave the station neglected. Even if it’s difficult, we have to do both at the same time. I will do everything to go hunting and restore the destroyed station.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum nodded at his remarks. He also decided to stand up again and work with Junghoon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As his deputy, Minhum was supposed to support him anyway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We will never be defeated again. And we won’t be ignored.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon’s eyes were glowing with new determination.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was Minhum who was the busiest. He practically led the Crusader Team to restore the devastated station while he assisted Commander Junghoon with carrying out his new mission and taking care of Sungwoo’s request.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As for your request, Sungwoo, I’ve found out some information from the community. So, I searched for the tips about Sosa-dong in Buchon City and Beomgye Station in Anyang City. In Sosa-dong, I …”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you going to say the Ogre Fighter was witnessed in Sosa-dong?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo asked before he continued, Minhum nodded, blinking his eyes, rather surprised.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you going to say it was covered with black smoke and full of zombies?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, that’s right. How do you know everything already?” </div><h2 id="chapter107">Chapter 107</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Well, I thought you could find out the information fast because you’re an analyst, but my junior picked it up more quickly than you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Hanho, who, standing behind Sungwoo, was absorbed in checking his smartphone, raised his head. Hanho was addicted to checking all the information available in the community.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum made a blank expression, knowing his work for Sungwoo was good for nothing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho said, “Sungwoo, I’ve got a message from Taesung. Fortunately, the village is safe. But I told him to defend the Safety Zone well all times and never go outside.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While Sungwoo was talking with Minhum, Hanho kept in touch with the village in Suwon through the community bulletin. He conveyed the message that they had to activate the Safety Zone and stay inside it because the Evolution Society might attack it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘And I have to go to Beomgye Station.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo came to know through the community intelligence that the “Ogre Fighter” was from Sosa-dong, Bucheon City. If that was the case, the last Raid Boss would be in Beomgye Station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘There is something in Beomgye Station.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to the community bulletin about Beomgye Station, there were posted comments that asked the community members not to approach the station area, citing that poison gas was leaking, and that the station area was full of zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The poison gas mentioned was most likely the “Abyssal Breath.” This meant that it was highly likely that there was another research center run by the Evolutionary Society in the station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, Deputy, let me use your helicopter.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was getting dark, but Sungwoo thought of heading straight to Beomgye Station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To mount a surprise attack like he did in Sindorim, he had to move fast.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? You want me to go back to Suwon? Man, are you saying I’m not useful anymore?” Hanho demanded, with a sad expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, well, that’s not what I mean. You are very good at finding the necessary tips in the community, You’re useful.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You don’t even say I’m good at throwing daggers! Wow! Community? Man, you are feeling jealous and so mean to me like this because I’ve said I prefer Orun, right? Oh, I think you have gotten sullen at me when I said the Youngdungpo Prosecutor was more handsome than you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You don’t deny it, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Sungwoo didn’t respond.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He borrowed a helicopter from the Crusader Team. Sungwoo and Jisu decided to go to Beomgye Station as scheduled, while Hanho would head to Suwon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The reason Sungwoo made such a decision was because a considerable amount of gold was needed to maintain the “Safety Zone,” but if the limits to the outsiders lasted longer than scheduled, the village might not have enough gold to sustain its security.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, it was too dangerous to operate a monster crackdown team to collect gold. Nobody knew what the Evolution Society would do if they got the crackdown team as hostages.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“In a critical situation like this, the village needs at least one player with a high level like you. Go and hand over some gold to your father.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it,” Hanho said in a sullen voice, but he didn’t disagree with his decision. He didn’t want to neglect the village where his parents were.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dudududududududu!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the helicopter engine was turned on. The guards of Youngdungpo Station were carrying several boxes inside the helicopter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo asked for daily necessities and food in addition to 1 million gold, which were necessary for the long-term security of the village.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“All set. Please get on board!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon the helicopter carrying Sungwoo’s party took off, and Junghoon was standing in front of the station, looking up at the helicopter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon initially objected to Sungwoo, whom he hired, heading to Beomgye Station. But when he heard that there might be another research center run by the Evolution Society, Junghoon understood Sungwoo’s decision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Come to think of it, Sungwoo was a powerful spear, let alone a shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woooooooong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The helicopter moved up to the highest possible altitude to avoid the herd of Wyverns that dominated the airspace of the Korean Peninsula.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wyverns spent a lot of time resting on the roof of buildings. When they were resting like that, it was very dangerous to fly because they were hard to detect. So, the best way to avoid their attack was to fly as far as possible from the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the helicopter reached the airspace of Anyang City.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’ll arrive in 5 minutes!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After meticulously checking the surrounding safety, the helicopter pilot approached the rooftop of a building. Sungwoo and Jisu jumped from the helicopter and landed on it safely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please take care of Orun!” Hanho shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The helicopter faded away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo grabbed the railing on the roof and looked around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Beomgye Station is over there!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu first headed toward the station. She found out the way to the station in an instant though she had never been here before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You found it very quickly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I looked at the surrounding buildings from the air early on and found it based on the shape of the station.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the two came down from the same sky, Sungwoo could not even sense the exact direction of the station, let alone the shape of the station building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Her extraordinary sense of geography was becoming sharper everyday.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was because of her excellent sense of direction that he chose to take her, not Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu went down the stairs of the building. Then, they crossed the street and entered the shopping complex near Beomgye Station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, she shouted, “Sungwoo, wait a second. Something is coming over the building on the left.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two hid in the alley.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, somebody came and shouted, “Quickly! Run faster!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it. We’re in big trouble. We can’t stop this!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Five men passed through the alley. They ran, looking behind them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, they were being chased by something at that moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, they are already there!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the chasers appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuh! Keeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were zombies. Dozens of zombies were chasing after the guys like crazy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed they would be caught at any moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shoot! Shoot quickly! If this goes on any longer, even our shelter will be in danger!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man with the cane fired flames. Then, they fired arrows and crossbows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, they succeeded in killing only two zombies. Then, the man with the arrows used his skills to fire two magic arrows in a row, but he killed only one zombie.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Faced with the zombies’ overwhelming offense, they could not withstand it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those inside the shopping mall with dental signs started to get busy. People moved around busily. Those carrying arrows stuck their heads outside the windows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come back quickly!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The door to the mall opened and two men with shields came out. It seemed that the shelter of the survivors was right inside the mall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No! We can’t stop them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have to divert them to a different place! You guys stay hiding quietly!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Zombies were popping out from the alley, totalling 50 already.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Among them were “zombie dogs.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeh! Kueeeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>If they stormed into such a shabby shelter, it would be impossible for the survivors to stop the zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s disperse to the left and right! We have to disperse the zombies to get them away from the shelter!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The five men eventually decided to sacrifice themselves forthie mission. They had no other choice to ensure the safety of their families in the shelter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment they were about to turn their heads, five zombies bounced into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A woman in red training pants jumped out of the alley and swung her sword twice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She avoided the hordes of zombies rushing to her and elbowed her way through them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every time she swung her sword, she killed three or four zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What followed next was more shocking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>A giant monster over 7 meters tall, made of bones, walked out of the alley.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, step to the side!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The woman in red training pants jumped and disappeared into the alley on the right. At that moment, the wrist of the giant monster gleamed with a blue flash.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the giant swung his fists, the zombies around him evaporated in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is that giant…?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, I think that’s the giant…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The five men, who decided to sacrifice themselves for the safety of the shelter, stopped, aghast at the shocking scene before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Right. I saw it too. I saw that man on TV.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, a man in a dark green robe came out of the alley.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He is the Necromancer…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The most famous person on the Korean Peninsula appeared. </div><h2 id="chapter108">Chapter 108</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “Wow! It’s the necromancer!”<br/><br/>Standing behind the door, a little boy, who seemed to be about eight years old, looked at Sungwoo in excitement. Then, a woman who seemed to be his mother pulled the boy’s arm.<br/><br/>“I’m sorry. I’ll give you some tea right away.”<br/><br/>“No, thanks.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu sat on the couch in the dentist’s office in the shelter. When the boy shouted ‘necromancer’, other children’s voices responded through the hallways.<br/><br/>“Necromancer! The real Necromancer is here!”<br/><br/>“Really? Are you serious? Where is he now?”<br/><br/>“I want to see him, too!”<br/><br/>The boy’s mother hurriedly closed the door and left.<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu rescued the survivors and even helped move the injured into the shelter.<br/><br/>Then someone who seemed to be the leader of the group said that he would like to express his gratitude, asking them to wait inside the house for a moment. Since it was getting dark and he could get some information about Beomgye Station from them, Sungwoo readily accepted his request.<br/><br/>“If we had not come here on time, they would have been put in great danger,” said Jisu.<br/><br/>Blood marks were on her chin and neck. Since she didn’t hesitate to walk through the middle of the enemy and swing her sword, her whole body was splattered with blood after the battle was over.<br/><br/>“Something on your chin, Jisu.”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“There is something on your chin.”<br/><br/>She touched her chin with her fingers, saw the blood mark and rubbed it with a<br/><br/>her red sleeve.<br/><br/>“On your neck, too.”<br/><br/>Frowning, she rubbed her neck this time.<br/><br/>“Now, I think I’m used to the smell of blood…” she mumbled.<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t respond, but felt a bit uncomfortable.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>They fought together for a long time, but Sungwoo felt he never had a good long conversation with her until now.<br/><br/>“Jisu, you said your house was on Jeju Island, right?”<br/><br/>“Yeah, that’s right,” she replied, casually.<br/><br/>“Are you going to Jeju Island someday?”<br/><br/>She said her house was on Jeju Island. Therefore, she couldn’t dare to go back home and stayed with Sungwoo until now.<br/><br/>She tilted her head at his question and said, “Can I go back home? It looks like everything will be different even if I go…”<br/><br/>“Well, I just asked you because you have never told me about your family.”<br/><br/>In fact, he never talked with her about general topics including her family.<br/><br/>Jisu paused for a moment and opened her mouth with an awkward smile.<br/><br/>“I’m sure my family will take care of themselves well. They are awful, so awful that I wanted to escape from them. So, I’m not that worried. I got freedom after escaping from my family, but I ended up being in a world like this.”<br/><br/>Awful family? She, too, seemed to be reluctant to talk about her family any more.<br/><br/>Again an awkward silence ensued.<br/><br/>Rattle-<br/><br/>At that moment, the door opened. Then, a large middle-aged man wearing a helmet entered.<br/><br/>“I’m really sorry to have kept you waiting. I had to check because I didn’t know when the zombies would come back. My name is Minsok Ahn.”<br/><br/>This man was the leader of the survivor group. He reached out and Sungwoo took his hand.<br/><br/>“My name is Sungwoo Yu.”<br/><br/>“I know you, Necromancer.”<br/><br/>Minsok then reached out to Jisu. She rubbed her hand clean of blood on her pants and shook hands with him.<br/><br/>“Oh, you are the red devil.”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>When Jisu asked, he laughed playfully as if he was embarrassed.<br/><br/>“Hahaha. Well, since you had no official nickname, my young sons said you looked like a scary ghost wearing red clothes and fighting in the middle of monsters. So, they started to call you a red devil. I’m sorry if you feel bad.”<br/><br/>“Oh, that’s fine.”<br/><br/>“Really? I think it’s a nice nickname, too.”<br/><br/>Jisu nodded, smiling at him.<br/><br/>“I saw you fighting, too. Wow, both of you were awesome. Most of our children here are treating you as their hero. By the way, where is the dagger man? Oh, that’s the nickname my sons gave to the man before I knew it…”<br/><br/>The dagger man he mentioned was Hanho, who went to Suwon. If he had heard it, he would have felt sad.<br/><br/>Anyway, this man was trying to get friendly with Sungwoo and Jisu. After talking with him briefly, Sungwoo discovered that Minsok was used to dealing with people, but as soon as he was done exchanging greetings, Minsok didn’t smile anymore.<br/><br/>“Alright, then…”<br/><br/>Minsok opened his mouth, his face stiffened.<br/><br/>His facial expressions showed that the situation here was not good.<br/><br/>“Thank you so much for saving us. We have survived because of your help.”<br/><br/>Minsok bowed to express his gratitude.<br/><br/>“Are those zombies coming out of Beomgye Station?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/>Minsok nodded and said, “Yes. It started three days ago. I just don’t know where they keep coming from. We can’t hold on our own any longer.”<br/><br/>“Then, why are you still staying here?”<br/><br/>Minsok replied, frowning, “Because of the damn quest.”<br/><br/>Quests always limited the player’s action anytime, anywhere. Sungwoo had moved through his ‘exclusive quest’ until now.<br/><br/>“What kind of quest is it?”<br/><br/>“It’s a local quest, and everyone in this area has received this quest.”<br/><br/>He turned his head out the window.<br/><br/>“If we go out of the building, we will be chased by the hordes of zombies. That’s why we can’t go outside. I was thinking of quickly escaping from this area, but half of our survivors are children and seniors. They are going to be killed if we move out of here recklessly.”<br/><br/>The survival group itself was weak, so they had no power to respond to the quest.<br/><br/>“I dare to tell you two, but if you don’t want to get caught by this quest, leave this area before midnight tonight. Otherwise, you will also be bound by this quest.”<br/><br/>Minsok knew that Sungwoo and Jisu had tremendous power to help him, but he gave altruistic advice in case they would be put in danger.<br/><br/>Of course, it’s also likely that Minsok was not honest. So, Sungwoo remained tight-lipped. Looking at his lips, Minsok’s eyes began to tremble.<br/><br/>In no time Sungwoo said, “We’re not leaving. We’ve come here to attack them.”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“We’re here to attack and occupy Beomgye Station.”<br/><br/>Minsok’s eyes trembled faster. There was relief and joy on his expression.<br/><br/>Suddenly, a savior appeared.<br/><br/>“Oh, thank you so much. Finally, we have hope we can save our families. Thank you very much.”<br/><br/>The necromancer, the most famous player, was here to save them.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Late at night, Sungwoo and Jisu were treated to a decent dinner and took a break. It had been a really long day.<br/><br/>It was a three-story shopping building, with about thirty survivors living on each floor. Like Minsok said there were many young children and old people.<br/><br/>He said his troops were not small like this originally. A lot of young people had been sacrificed so far.<br/><br/>Knock! Knock!<br/><br/>Someone knocked on the door of the office and entered. She was Minsok’s wife.<br/><br/>“Can I assign you to one room?”<br/><br/>She asked carefully, but Sungwoo and Jisu shook their heads at the same time.<br/><br/>“No.”<br/><br/>“If I have rooms available, can we use two?”<br/><br/>Minsuk’s wife said that she would check it out and reply later, then she left.<br/><br/>Right after that, the door opened again.<br/><br/>“By the way…”<br/><br/>A little boy who seemed to be about eight years old raised his head. He seemed to be Minsok’s son.<br/><br/>“Can I come in?”<br/><br/>“Sure.”<br/><br/>When Jisu allowed him to come in, three kids came in at the same time.<br/><br/>“Wow! He’s really the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>“Red devil sister! Cool!”<br/><br/>They behaved as if they were meeting the main characters of a cartoon. Sungwoo didn’t like dealing with kids, but he didn’t make them leave coldly.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, he wondered if this was the positive function of the broadcast that Junghoon mentioned. He couldn’t deny that he was a source of courage to somebody.<br/><br/>In a world that has turned into hell, there was little possibility that somebody could support the people, and those who showed that possibility were called heroes.<br/><br/>“Can you show me a skeleton?” asked a kid.<br/><br/>“Skeleton?”<br/><br/>“Yeah! I saw a skeleton in the air. So cool!”<br/><br/>Of course, the skeleton looked great when seen in the video, but if these kids actually saw the skeleton before their eyes, it was obvious that they wouldn’t sleep for days.<br/><br/>Therefore, Sungwoo only summoned the smallest skeleton among them, Orun.<br/><br/>“Wow! Skeleton!”<br/><br/>“Cute!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo wondered how such a terrible thing could look cute, but the kids began to surround Orun and chatter away.<br/><br/>Thanks to the kids’ diversion, Sungwoo and Jisoo could take a break, though Orun had quite a hard time because of the pestering kids.<br/><br/>If Hanho had seen it, he would have felt jealous without doubt. </div><h2 id="chapter109">Chapter 109</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Sungwoo was sitting alone in the room he was assigned to, waiting for the quest message.<br/><br/>He was thinking of going to sleep after checking the message.<br/><br/>Like Minsok said, a quest was issued before his eyes after midnight.<br/><br/>[Local Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: City of Death<br/><br/>-Type:’Escape’ or ‘Subjugation’<br/><br/>-Goal: Escape from the area or Crackdown on zombies<br/><br/>-Compensation: Differential payment according to type<br/><br/>*You are isolated in a city occupied by death. In order to overcome this crisis, you must decide whether to escape this area quickly or confront death head-on and win. Whatever you choose, death will chase you.<br/><br/>* Zombies chase the survivors outside. (After being caught, they will be chased even if they enter indoors.)<br/><br/>But that wasn’t the end.<br/><br/>– Caution! The level of difficulty is reset because there is a player with a certain level (LV. 15) or higher in the area.<br/><br/>‘Reset? If the player is level 15 or higher, he is me?’<br/><br/>Since Sungwoo joined the quest, something had begun to change. That message appeared before the eyes of all players in the area, and soon those inside the building began to get busy.<br/><br/>When Sungwoo went out to the hallway, Jisu was also outside the door. As if she was testing the gas mask she had prepared in advance, she held the gas mask in one hand and looked into the air as if focusing on the sound.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I can feel something ominous.”<br/><br/>“What do you feel?”<br/><br/>She focused a little more, then frowned. Her eyes moved along the ceiling and stopped on the front window.<br/><br/>“I can hear the violent vibrations outside the building and around this area. Tremendous footsteps…”<br/><br/>-Zombies are chasing all survivors in and outside the building.<br/><br/>It was obvious to know what was responsible for such vibrations. The children’s crying grew louder down the stairs.<br/><br/>“Guys, go upstairs!”<br/><br/>“Ahhh! Mom!”<br/><br/>“Shush! Be quiet and move on to the roof! Hurry up!”<br/><br/>Soon there was somebody moving fast up the stairs. Chaos deepened with the sound of people moving furniture and metal clanging.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, Jisu!” Minsok shouted.<br/><br/>He came up to the third floor, fully armed with chain mail and a shield.<br/><br/>“Damn it! I didn’t know things would happen like this. When we were indoors, zombies didn’t come inside, but all of a sudden…”<br/><br/>His face stiffened. Behind him some elderly people with disabilities were walking up to the stairs to go to the rooftop. Like Minsok said, there were too few among the survivors who could confront the zombies.<br/><br/>Sungwoo went into the room and put on the robe, then took out the repeating crossbow.<br/><br/>“This game is always like this. They are just toying with us,” Sungwoo said calmly.<br/><br/>Minsok felt relieved a bit by his dauntless attitude.<br/><br/>Minsok said, “We’ll move those who can’t fight to the rooftop before stopping the zombies. We can stop the ordinary zombies, but we are in big trouble if we are faced with something like Ghouls.”<br/><br/>Ghoul. There was no consensus that Ghouls are different from the undead by nature, but in fantasy, they were described as a race far superior to zombies. And this game followed the laws of fantasy.<br/><br/>“Dad?”<br/><br/>Minsuk’s son, the little boy who played with Orun, came out of the room, rubbing his eyes.<br/><br/>“Son, what are you doing? Go to the rooftop like we practiced.”<br/><br/>“Zombies coming? Are we in big trouble?”<br/><br/>“Don’t worry. Dad is defending here. Also, our Necromancer uncle is here.”<br/><br/>“Dad, be careful! Uncle, hang in there!”<br/><br/>Minsok persuaded his son to hurry to the rooftop. At the same time, somebody yelled from the second floor down the stairs.<br/><br/>“Hey, They’re already nearby!”<br/><br/>Minsok walked up to the window and pulled the curtains. He stuck his head out into the deep darkness.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>In the dark streets and buildings without any light there were green dots glowing in the wide alleyway. They were glowing eyes.<br/><br/>The eyes of the dead were dimly lit. When those green eyes glowed from the alleys everywhere, Minsok felt as if a swarm of insects were flying into the building.<br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/>Their disgusting screaming broke through the window frames.<br/><br/>“We have to go downstairs right now!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu followed Minsok down the stairs.<br/><br/>“Damn it! There are a lot of them at the back door, too!”<br/><br/>“Did you close all the windows? Block the doors with something heavy!”<br/><br/>As they got closer to the first floor, their shouting and the zombies’ screaming rang together.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>The glass door of the building shook roughly. Although it was blocked by a heavy desk, it was unclear how long it would withstand the violent shaking.<br/><br/>Watching the horde of zombies screaming and struggling outside the window in deep darkness, Sungwoo felt like he was facing the waves of the dark night sea, sitting in a cabin.<br/><br/>‘At least 200 zombies are coming here. It is dangerous to confront them inside the building. Besides, if I am trapped here, I cannot summon large skeletons.’<br/><br/>It was not right for Sungwoo to stay indoors while zombies could storm in the building anytime.<br/><br/>And it was dangerous for him to use the Corpse Explosion inside. Given all the conditions, he had to get out somehow.<br/><br/>“As things stand now, they will storm inside at any time,” said Sungwoo calmly.<br/><br/>“Uh, what should we do?”<br/><br/>When Minsok asked, Sungwoo paused for a moment, then opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“There is nothing good if we fight inside a small building. Let me open the way out, so let’s escape outside.”<br/><br/>Jisu pulled her knife. However, Minsok’s face was full of anxiety.<br/><br/>“There are too many elderly and weak. Can we get out? Even if we go out, can we get out of this hellish…”<br/><br/>“This game doesn’t save anybody who stays still.”<br/><br/>Black smoke arose behind Sungwoo’s back, then several human beast skeletons began to appear. Bones sprang out of their bags, making shields and spears.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>They formed a line of shields at the entrance of the mall. Since the space was small inside, Sungwoo couldn’t summon all the skeletons, but they were a strong force, compared with Minsok’s forces inside.<br/><br/>“Whew! I trust you, Sungwoo. Since they are not easily killed, you have to smash their heads by all means.”<br/><br/>Holding a shield, Minsok also joined the ranks of the skeletons.<br/><br/>“Then, let me first attack those zombies who are not killed easily.”<br/><br/>At that moment, the glass door broke and a horde of zombies began to storm inside.<br/><br/>“Well, let me show you which zombies are not killed…”<br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo said that, a message appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/>-‘Synergy effect’ is given due to your team play.<br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/>Shield Charge (Level 1)<br/> -Category: weapon synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: 10 shields installed<br/><br/>-Effect: Increases muscle strength when attacking with shield (+20%), increases knock-back rate when attacking with shield (+10%)<br/><br/>Since the number of shields of the skeletons and survivors exceeded ten, the synergy suitable for breaking through such a mess was triggered.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Wearing heavy armor and carrying heavy shields with synergy effects, the human beast skeletons advanced forward. And the moment they confronted the zombies there appeared a message.<br/><br/>-‘Lesser Class of Death’ faces the true power of death, decreasing all stats. (-30%)<br/><br/>Like this message predicted, the zombies were no match for the Necromancer.<br/><br/>All of a sudden, the movement of the zombies was noticeably slower.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>The skeletons with shields began to crush the slow-moving zombies and advance like the herd of water buffaloes.<br/><br/>The reason the survivors were afraid of zombies was because they might be infected if wounded. So, they could not engage in fighting actively for fear of being wounded.<br/><br/>Minsok said that quite a few of his colleagues became zombies, so eventually he had to kill them with his own hands.<br/><br/>In that sense, the skeletons were in an advantageous position because they could freely fight the zombies without worrying about infection.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Nine human beast skeletons advanced in a single file. With thick shields in their left hands and long spears in their right hands, they pushed the zombies away recklessly just like the ancient Greek phalanx.<br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/>Zombies rushed continuously and hit against the shields, but the skeletons with gigantic build stood in their place and did not move back even one step.<br/><br/>“Push them!”<br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/>At Sungwoo’s order, the skeletons stretched their left foot forward and pushed them with the shields. Then, the zombies stuck on the shields fell down all at once.<br/><br/>Kueeeeeeh! Kueeeeh!<br/><br/>When the skeletons trampled the fallen zombies, more zombies kept coming. This time the skeletons stabbed the long spears into them at a right angle.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>Thick blood splattered over the white bone shields, and zombie corpses began to pile up on the marble floor.<br/><br/>-You have earned 300 gold by hunting low-level zombies.<br/><br/>-You have earned 300 gold by hunting low-level zombies.<br/><br/>Although the skeletons killed so many zombies, Sungwoo obtained only 300 gold.<br/><br/>“Those in the rear, fire arrows!” Minsok ordered. </div><h2 id="chapter110">Chapter 110</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The players shoot arrows over the skeletons’ shoulders. Sungwoo also lifted his crossbow and fired a series of arrows like a machine gun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was impossible to kill the zombies unless the flying arrows hit their heads, but just making the zombies stumble was a great help to the skeletons’ charge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ‘Knock-Back’ of  was often effective. The zombies bounced a few meters and pushed back their fellow zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pressure of Valor!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok also fought brilliantly. It looked like he belonged to the class of knight, so when he used his skills, a yellow magic circle appeared on his shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the next moment, a large magic circle was created on the heads of the zombies that charged forward. Then the magic circle fell and pressed the zombies to the floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuh! Kueeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They couldn’t kill the zombies at once. However, the zombies were almost incapaciated. Moving forward, Minsok wielded his sword and skillfully cut their heads off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Keep firing the arrows! We have to get out of the building!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While they kept pushing the zombies and moved forward, they got closer to the entrance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that time, a blue flash of a magic arrow shot by an archer-type player missed its target, flying into the street, illuminating its surroundings dimly along the path of the light.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shit! I killed so many zombies, but they haven’t decreased at all.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The heads of the zombies that filled the street were revealed for a moment, then shrouded in darkness. The outside of the building was so crowded with zombies that there was no room to set one’s foot down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo fired the repeating crossbows out of the window. He had a flashlight tied around his body, but it didn’t help him see clearly. The message before his eyes was his guide.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 300 gold by hunting low-level zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 300 gold by hunting low-level zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 300 gold by hunting low-level zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was like throwing a grenade into the enemy line.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Explosions occurred among the hordes of zombies, burning a number of zombies near the explosion area. Their body fragments were scattered in all directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God! The explosions are so powerful…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you know how many zombies were killed with just one explosion?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players were dumbfounded by the magnitude of the explosion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re going outside. Get ready!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“When?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Right now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo said that, the human beast skeletons bent their backs and jumped off the ground. Their merciless assault picked up, and the zombies standing in their way were struck by the shields and collapsed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, since the zombies were not killed completely, those who were still still alive raised themselves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Smash their heads quickly!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While the players were running around in confusion, the skeletons threw themselves out of the window and broke into the zombie horde.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They threw away the shields and spears, lifted their claws, and began to engage in a hand-to-hand fight with the zombies. It was the moment when the battle was taking place outside, not indoors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in the affected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now that space for fighting was secured, it was time for Sungwoo’s overwhelming reinforcements to take over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- Thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>A couple of huge white objects appeared on both sides of the street. Even though their shapes weren’t exactly visible, they stood out by reflecting the little light off their bodies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, they are…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s Drake!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There appeared ‘Bone Drake’ on the left, and the ‘Ogre Fighter’ on the right. They were the undead Raid Boss monsters that could not be compared to zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eight skeletons, including Orum, stuck on Bone Drake’s back<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- Thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment the two giants moved, eight skeletons jumped to the ground like they were jumping from a helicopter and struck the heads of the zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Orun cut off two zombies’ heads with a single stroke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As Orun moved forward, wielding his sword, the zombies began to fall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, that wasn’t all. Bone Drake swung his tail low in the direction where there were no skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The zombies, swept away by the huge tail, were thrown in all directions like grains of corn being burned in a fire. Some of them were thrown as far as the windows on the third floor of the building across the street.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Drake turned his head to the right, the Ogre Fighter stomped his feet, crushing the zombies and kicking them with the top of his feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Ogre Fighter could not use the lightning skill of the “Protection of the Thunder God” bracelet because the waiting time of 24 hours had not passed, but just moving his huge body alone was as powerful as a tank.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 300 gold by hunting low-level zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 300 gold by hunting low-level zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 300 gold by hunting low-level zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 300 gold by hunting low-level zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo kept collecting 300 gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can’t believe it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, it’s just amazing to see them wiping out the zombies like that…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players were gaping at the fierce battle of the undead in the dark.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, bring the people on the roof here. Oh, do you have any vehicles that can carry them?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure! Just in case, we prepared two minibuses in the underground parking lot. Hyunsok! Jongmin! Go underground and get them ready!” Minsok replied.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok turned and prepared to escape, while Sungwoo checked the situation outside the building to plan the deployment of the skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, there was not yet enough space for him to realign his forces, so he had to continue hand-to-hand fighting instead of killing the zombies effectively.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeh! Kueeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Zombies still keep coming!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>More than half of the zombies were wiped out, but they were still crawling out of the alley.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Given the way they put on clothes, most of them weren’t from this world. There were far more from the alien world, like the zombies summoned by Sungwoo, than those who became infected and turned into zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This means that they can come endlessly. In the worst case, we won’t have defeated them before we occupy Beomgye Station.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The zombies decreased a lot, but never gave up and moved blindly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>For example, they crawled like worms on Bone Drake for a meaningless attack. Dozens of zombies charged at the human beast skeletons and inflicted effective damage by pressing them down all together.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your subordinate spirit will return to eternal death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eventually, one of the Werewolf skeletons was ripped apart by the zombies and died.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was confident of this kind of war of attrition, but since this was a large-scale quest given to the entire region, a huge number of zombies that he could not easily defeat were coming in droves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The damage was not limited to just one Werewolf skeleton. Since cracks began to open up all over the bodies of the skeletons, it was inevitable that there would be more sacrifices.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Nonetheless, I should not summon the Response of Death or Grim Reaper because I don’t know when our fighting will end today.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo expected tonight’s fighting would be very long because he planned to move on to occupy Beomgye Station itself after wiping out the zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, let’s go. We have to take over the streets and block alleys as quickly as possible.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu pulled up the zipper on the sweatshirt and turned her wrist to loosen its muscles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah. I’m ready.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu jumped into the battle. He fired the crossbow with his left hand and swung the Ownerless Sword with his right hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although it was a heavy sword, he could use it without difficulty thanks to his high physical strength.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In close-range battles like this, Jisu fought better than Sungwoo. She grabbed the sword with both hands and swung it, running around on anomalous steps.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The blade of her sword moved precisely every moment, cutting off the zombies heads. In addition, she unleashed the energy of the sword toward the zombies in the rear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blood splattered all over her body, but she didn’t care and moved deeper into the enemy forces. It seemed that she was enjoying the fighting itself. </div><h2 id="chapter111">Chapter 111</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Alley! Focus on firing the arrows towards the alley! Stop them from coming out to the street!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They’re crowded on the right side of the bar! Use some magic skill to get rid of them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now that the players inside the building joined Sungwoo and Jisu in the fierce fighting, there was a great decrease in the zombies on the street in front of the mall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo fired the repeating crossbow toward the alley and moved the Werebear skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Four large Werebears blocked the alley where the zombies popped out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He also had Bone Drake and Ogre Skeleton guard both sides of the street.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wooong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>After he secured the safety around the building area, the shutter of the underground parking lot was raised and two minibuses drove out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Vehicles are ready!” Minseok shouted as he got off the driver’s seat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I blocked the zombies from approaching as much as possible. Please tell the people to get on the bus quickly!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok turned and shouted at the players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, we will guard the entrance to the building. Got it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Players lined up from the entrance of the building to the doors of the minibuses. In no time, the elderly and children began to descend the stairs of the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A young woman who came down first grabbed her children and pointed to the bus entrance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, listen to me well. Don’t look anywhere else, don’t look down at the ground. Just look in front and run all the way into the bus? Got it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They sniffed their noses and nodded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“One, two, three! Run!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They ran quickly and got into the bus. Their terrified eyes were bloodshot and swollen, but they shut up and followed their parents’ direction very well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good job! Put on your seat belt. Don’t talk inside the bus while we’re riding this bus.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sister, how long do we have to drive?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s all over now. It will be over soon…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the attack by the hordes of zombies only began now. As always, this game didn’t end at the 1st phase. There appeared a message before the survivors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Ghouls are moving after smelling human flesh.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were restless and scared to see the message.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck! Ghoul!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok once warned them against ghouls before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fuck! Ghouls are coming soon! These fucking animals are quite different from zombies. They persistently target only those who are alive.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even Minsok looked depressed, stricken with fear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I dare to ask you a favor. Please stop them from approaching the children. They are moving so fast…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he said that, he almost burst into tears for a moment, unable to finish, then breathed roughly and said, “When these fucking animals broke the car window and grabbed my youngest son, I couldn’t even respond. I am afraid that they’re going to do the same this time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His hand holding the shield trembled violently. There was a reason why ghouls were embedded in his mind as the object of fear and hatred.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ll try my best to stop them,” said Sungwoo. But he didn’t say he would guarantee it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you. I will do my utmost, too. This time I definitely want to protect my family.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, all the elderly boarded the second minibus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With Bone Drake standing at the forefront, Sungwoo had Ogre Skeleton defend the back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He placed the two minibuses between them, then positioned the skeletons on both sides of the buses to protect the elderly and the weak as much as possible. Minsok and other players also stood close to both sides of the minibuses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We won’t be able to drive the bus quickly, but we’re going to head to Beomgye Station as safely as possible. Let me go there and get rid of the ringleader and finish this quest,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you very much. We will put our lives on this fight, so we can’t be a burden on you,” Minsok replied.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They now began to go further into the dark city center.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whenever they ran into a vehicle in front of them, Bone Drake had to push it aside.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Because of these obstacles, they were literally moving at a snail’s pace.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They moved forward little by little, but couldn’t relax their hands holding their weapons tightly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They illuminated the lights in all directions and slowly let out a hot breath.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it…Why is it so quiet all of a sudden?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>” Don’t say such awful things! Ghouls don’t make any noise except when they chew internal organs.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The minibuses and their headlights slowly pushed away the darkness in front. However, the flashlights the players were holding were so dim that they wandered around here and there in the dark.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was dark in the city and the alleys were long. Their flashlights could only illuminate the entrance of the alley. The survivors had to rely on wild imagination to figure out what was there at the end of the alley.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, this place?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They soon came across a commercial building with a pale light. It seemed to be a children’s clothing store, but the lights in the lobby were flickering feebly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, people here were also killed…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I ran into people here during lunchtime yesterday.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were dozens of zombie corpses strewn at the entrance. Some players’ bodies were also seen among them. And there were a lot more corpses inside the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Without the Necromancer, we would have faced the same fate as those who were killed here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What a relief!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They turned their eyes away from the corpses while passing by the building, but it was too early for them to feel relieved yet. They had yet to wait long until dawn broke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And night was by no means kind to them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ssssssss-<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, something appeared around us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu alternately looked at the rooftops of both buildings. Her eyesight was not strong enough to see through the darkness, but she noticed some alien afterimages, such as the gray paint spreading over the black paint.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everyone raised their heads to hear that. Somebody was heard swallowing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! They came!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shush!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could figure out what these “silent beings” hovering around were.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He gently lifted his bone shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, something stuck on Bone Drake’s back. Before Bone Drake even reacted, it bounced back into the air again. Sungwoo lost sight of its movement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly, the player who was moving at the forefront collapsed, with his head fully cut off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everybody, stop!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their procession stopped. There was a red pool around the neck of the player, whose body was lying on the ground. Since he was attacked in an instant, his knees were still shaking as if he was walking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The sound of the engines of the minibuses resonated ominously in the silence. The survivors couldn’t even make the sound of breathing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Watch out. Your left!” Jisu shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something jumped from the alley on the left and ran toward the minibuses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The children’s faces were reflected in the bus windows. The purple monster rushed towards the windows. They could do nothing about the attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, the ghoul’s head rotated twice in the air and bounced off, separated from the body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu seized the chance to throw herself to confront the ghoul.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the flying ghoul struck her hard and threw her into the minibus behind her very hard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oops!” She threw up several times as if she had pain in the belly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But before she pulled herself together, she lifted her sword and watched out. She clearly discovered this was an emergency situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, there came out eerie sounds from everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuh! Keeeeeeeeh! Kieeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They’re coming toward us in droves!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ghous began to appear one by one at the entrance of the alley, on the rooftop railing and on the road sign. They were not small.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuh! Keeeeeeeeh! Kieeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tall cannibal ears with purple skin and empty eyes of only black without whites were aiming at those who were alive and breathing. Sticky saliva flowed out of their mouths with no teeth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They didn’t rush immediately. As if they were looking at a chicken coop to choose a chicken to eat, they examined the survivors, with their greasy black eyes rolling back and forth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok was standing next to the minibus where his family members were on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While lifting his shield, Minsok made eye contact with Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There are too many,” he said in a voice full of frustration.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Was it because of the trauma that he suffered after losing his youngest son? The tip of his sword trembled. </div><h2 id="chapter112">Chapter 112</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>He opened his mouth desperately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, if a human becomes a skeleton, is he still conscious?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok grabbed the hilt firmly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Jisu said, “Sungwoo, they are about to attack us now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like she said, the ghouls began to lower themselves slowly in an apparent move to attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, please do me a favor,” Minsok said as if he wanted to leave a will.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Sungwoo could not reply because of the urgency of the situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They’re coming now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as Minsok finished saying it, the cannibals ran toward the ‘soft flesh’ of those inside the buses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Protect the children!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just like Minsok warned, they were not interested in the skeletons at all. They only focused on the prey inside the bus, rushing to catch the children to fill up their stomachs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Therefore, their main targets were the street players and the elderly in the car.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo fired the repeating crossbows into the air, but most of them scattered into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They’re moving so fast.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were not just fast. Their movements were very erratic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They first seemed to run forward, then bounced sideways and rolled over the floor. Then, they jumped back and ran forward again. It was impossible to predict where they would run and bounce.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Behind Sungwoo, a player’s scream disappeared into the air. With his upper body cut, his lower body staggered, blood gushing, and fell under the wheel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ghouls were incredibly fast, so Sungwoo and the players could not attack properly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tuuung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, a ghoul landed on the second minibus. It struck the ceiling of the bus with its left hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump! Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as the ghoul struck down, the ceiling was literally torn off like a sheet of paper.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Block him!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo moved the Werewolf skeleton. The skeleton jumped right on the top and hit the ghoul. The two got entangled and fell behind the bus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your subordinate spirit now returns to eternal death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could not know what was going on behind the bus. All he saw was that the ghoul shattered the Werewolf’s skull, then stood up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ghoul screamed and faced Sungwoo directly. His big eyes were fixed on Sungwoo’s stomach. Rather the ghoul was aiming for something in his stomach.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, however, a magic circle fell from over the ghoul’s head and pushed him down to the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, someone rushed to the fallen ghoul and struck his head with a shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the ghoul’s eyeballs popped out. The attacker was Minsok. He swung his sword to cut the ghoul’s head off and kicked it away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Watch your back!” Sungwoo shouted at Minsok.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he fired the repeating crossbow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok quickly lifted the shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, another ghoul smashed the surface of the shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Minsook endured the shock and began to attack the monster with tremendous momentum.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He shook the ghoul’s balance by pushing the shield against the monster, then stabbed the sword into its stomach and cut it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I must definitely kill this monster once and for all.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since he knew he couldn’t kill the ghoul by cutting its stomach, he lifted his sword, tore up its intestines and cut its heart.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With its body cut and torn, the mutilated ghoul fell to the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a perfect fight. But as he tried to turn his head, he raised his shield, startled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? Ig wasn’t killed when it was mutilated like this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ghoul, whose heart was cut off, was recovering from the wounds and raising its body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t worry. Let me take care of him,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo picked up a giant black scythe “Grim Reaper”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Death Scythe, ‘Grim Reaper,’ is summoned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Grim Reaper retention time (00:59:58)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although he tried to save his time as much as possible, he used the 1st awakening time after realizing that the situation was serious.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You obtain the power of ‘Lich’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Your subordinate spirits increase by (+50).<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All stats increase by (+10).<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You can revive and regenerate the destroyed undead nearby ‘indefinitely as much as the maximum number of your subordinate spirits.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I see. Got it. Whew…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok was not surprised to see the Necromancer with his bones exposed because he had already seen it on the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, he felt different when he actually saw the Necromancer in person. He could not help but feel overwhelmed by his grotesque image.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sungwoo looked at the message floating in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit<br/><br/><br/><br/>* This is an undead object that had an owner. The ties between master and servant were cut off by its death and are now yours.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Undead type monsters such as ghouls could also be resurrected as the subordinate spirits ‘after they were killed once’. In this case, they didn’t become a skeleton, but they kept their original appearance as a ghoul.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Anyway, I can reinforce my forces with this.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Skeletons began to move more boldly. The ghouls moved so quickly that it was hard to catch them, but their target, namely Sungwoo, was slow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Let me catch and kill those targeting the players and the buses.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Surprisingly, the ghouls ran around like crazy, moving vertically and horizontally, then rushed towards the buses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s eyes were only fixed on those ghouls. Just before they hit the buses, the Werewolf skeletons on standby charged at them. Two skeletons threw themselves on one ghoul at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the Werewolf skeletons was quickly knocked out, but the other skeleton grabbed the ghoul by the neck. The skeleton that had been smashed a moment ago was reassembled, shrouded in a green light, and suddenly the two skeletons started striking down the ghoul.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 9,000 gold by hunting the ‘ghoul’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This kind of fighting began to take place everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bone Drake snatched and crushed the ghouls running between buildings. With a growing increase in the ghouls that changed into Sungwoo’s subordinate spirit, Sungwoo’s forces began to gain the upperhand in the fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 9,000 gold by hunting the ‘ghoul’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like a hunting dog chasing a wolf, Sungwoo’s ghouls moved as a group to chase and bite the enemies running around in all directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 9,000 gold by hunting the ‘ghoul’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The more the Necromancer fought, the stronger he became. Sungwoo was not the only one who was fighting now. Minsok fought brilliantly. Sunngwoo carefully looked at him throughout the battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The Wall of Valor!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as Minsok shouted, a yellow magic circle covered his shield. This was a skill different from what he used in attacking the ghouls. As he pounced on the ghoul, the ghoul slipped as if slipping on oil.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>He stabbed the sword into the ghoul and cut its stomach open at once, but at the last minute he cut the ghoul’s heart.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘His attack is perfect!’ Sungwoo thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok proved that he was not stuck helplessly inside the building just because he was weak.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His power was simply not overwhelming enough to protect the people around him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Aside from his stats, he might be stronger than Junghoon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought that even this middle-aged man might be stronger than the Youngdungpo Prosecutor, ranked 4th on the players’ list.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok burrowed into the ghoul by lifting his shield, then swung his sword and cut through the back of its knees. The ghoul staggered, and at that moment Minsok pushed it down with his shield and stabbed the sword into his heart.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whew…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first glance, Minsok didn’t seem to have chosen a one or two star job. He didn’t fight as well as Jisu who had an unusual sense of fighting, but he was fighting better than anyone else. He moved calmly and with agility, though his attack was rather rough and clunky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dad! Dad!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hush! Keep you head down and stay quiet!” He hissed at his son to be quiet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And there was a reason why he had to fight so hard at the risk of his life this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This time, I won’t lose my family…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He still vividly remembered how the ghouls stormed his car and snatched his youngest son.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly after the local quest was triggered, his family was unfortunately stuck on the road.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After he agreed to join hands with another group nearby, he was on his way to the designated shelter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He grabbed the steering wheel and moved across the twisted roads. He was about 500 meters away from the shelter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, there was the sound of the car window smashing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang! </div><h2 id="chapter113">Chapter 113</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Oh! Honey!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dad!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He looked in the rearview mirror. No, he shouldn’t have done that. He should have turned his head straight and stretched his arms first. In that brief moment when he couldn’t respond, his youngest was pulled out of the window by the ghoul.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While he stopped moving his hand holding the steering wheel for a moment, his son disappeared into the end of the alley, carried away in the ghoul’s mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He would never forget that sinful moment his son was forcibly taken by the ghoul never to return.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right now, the disgusting ghoul that had killed his son was trampled under Minsok’s feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me cut you to pieces! Damn ghoul!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While he was confronting the ghoul, he turned his eyes to the bus just in case. If another ghoul was found aiming for the bus, he would turn and run to kill that ghoul.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘We can do it. If we can resist like this, we can protect all of the people in the buses.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, he spotted another ghoul climbing onto the back of the bus. He immediately ran and stabbed the sword into the ghoul’s leg, dragging him down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>He struck the ghoul’s head with his shield. After avoiding the ghoul’s nails flying toward his head, he swung his sword. Meanwhile, he fixed his eyes on the bus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He saw his two sons shaking their heads with their heads buried in his wife’s arms…<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 12)<br/><br/><br/><br/>He quickly invested stats in his physical strength. Then, he looked around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Was it his illusion based on false hope that the situation was getting better?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok, Sungwoo and Jisu were fighting exceptionally well, but the other players were helplessly slaughtered by the ghouls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhh! It hurts! Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuuh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A man was screaming, leaning against a wheel, with his arm cut off. A ghoul was already eating the intestines of a murdered man.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kaaaaaaaaah!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A woman screamed. With the ghoul’s teeth in her neck, she was dragged over the rooftop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the situation got worse and the ghouls attached from all directions, the defense around the two buses began to weaken.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uncle! Look at the front of the bus!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Someone shouted loudly. On the left side of the first bus, a ghoul was pulling an old man out of the window.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haaaaaaah! Haaaahh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the ghoul’s nails pierced his back, the old man was pulled out of the window helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a matter of fact, this was not a situation in which these people could get rid of the ghouls. Their friends and families were cruelly being killed in real time before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo wanted to stop this tragic situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thanks to the effects of the Grim Reaper’s ‘Killing Zone’, Sungwoo’s broken skeletons rose up again, moving in groups and hunting the ghouls one by one, but it was virtually impossible to stop the loss of their lives in this chaotic situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Tell the people in the bus to lower their heads right now!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had to confront the ghouls almost alone in this chaotic situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhh! Dad!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok suddenly stopped moving while running toward the first bus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He turned right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two ghouls were attacking the bus where his family members were.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He yelled and used his skills. A yellow pattern floated over the shield, and a magic circle fell from the air and pressed down one of the ghouls, but there was still one ghoul stuck on the bus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He immediately reached out his hand. He needed to use a second skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Not available now. (Waiting time: 00:01:58)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ghoul stretched out his long arm inside the window, waving his dagger-like fingers toward Minsok’s son.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I’m too late.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok recalled that brief moment when his youngest son disappeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I’m too late again.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>If he was a little late again, he wouldn’t be able to stop the ghoul’s attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>He threw his heavy shield at the ghoul.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he threw his sword, too.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shouting loud, he ran at full speed and struck the ghoul’s body stuck to the window. The ghoul fell off the bus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok got entangled with the ghoul, rolled on the ground, then fell down to the underground stairs of a shopping mall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no! Honey!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dad! No! Dad! Ahhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head after hearing the boy’s crying. He heard Minsok and the ghoul wrestling down the stairs, but he couldn’t see them because it was so dark there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhh! Oh, uncle! Uncle Necromancer! Please save my dad! Oh, please!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo found Minsok’s shield and sword on the ground<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Is he fighting the ghoul with his bare hands?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo hurried down the stairs. He lifted the flashlight tied to the repeating crossbow and pulled out his sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was only the sound of him trampling down the stairs. As he went down the stairs little by little, I heard someone letting out a rough breath.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Gasp! Huhhhhhhh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo arrived at the end of the stairs and found Minsok sitting in front of the iron gate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was holding a dagger and under his feet was the ghoul’s body with his belly cut open.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Coughl!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Minsok’s stomach was also sliced open. Blood was gushing between his legs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me bring you some portions.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, that won’t save my life. You know that. Right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minseok was right. In fact, the portions could not heal someone who was as deeply wounded like Minsok.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, I should defend my family…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was weeping bitter tears, thinking of his family.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn shit ghouls!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His eyes trembled violently as if he was gradually losing his mind, but he opened his mouth with all his might. He seemed to say a lot of things.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I couldn’t hear your reply to my request a moment ago, but please, please defend my family by using me…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He lowered his head even before finishing his last word.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo raised his head and looked up the stairs. And suddenly he thought he wasn’t confident about going up there. At the same time, he remembered Minsok’s request that he could not answer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok’s request was that if he died, Sungwoo should resurrect and raise him as a skeleton to protect his family. The last thing the knight left behind was his father’s remorse.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And something unexpected happened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Exclusive Quest’ is activated because special conditions are satisfied.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Exclusive Quest]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Title: Will of A Knight<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Type: ‘Salvation’ or ‘Neglect’ of the dead<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Goal: Raise the knight as a ‘skeleton’<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Reward: Exclusive skill<br/><br/><br/><br/>*There was a knight with a strong mission. He died for that mission on the one hand, but he had a deep grudge because he failed to fulfill that mission, on the other. He left a will with you who hold the reins of death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You have received the knight’s will and you are qualified to possess his body. However, you must be responsible for the safety of ‘his family’ according to his will. When you fulfill your responsibility, the knight’s body will reward you with loyalty, above all else.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, you can take the knight’s will as the weak man’s last will, then leave. The choice is up to you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Your choices affect your ‘destiny’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is this a quest?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was a quest for Sungwoo to raise his own subordinate spirit, which he had never done or seen before. What’s certain was that Minsok’s actions satisfied certain conditions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, this was far from difficult.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo resurrected the body of the middle-aged knight, Minsok.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Oooh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok’s body was engulfed in green flames. Slowly, the bones began to appear from beneath the flesh of his limbs. The flames covered his face. Then, his empty eyes filled with green light.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The big knight stood up again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-A contract relationship with the ‘Death Knight’ is established.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* He maintains his consciousness during his lifetime.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* If the conditions are satisfied, you can use him as your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You have accepted my request.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sugnwoo handed the ‘Ownerless Sword’ to the Death Knight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His scrawny hand grabbed the black greatsword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go back up and get rid of the ghouls!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The knight climbed the stairs. He was ready for another fierce fight. </div><h2 id="chapter114">Chapter 114</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The sound of bones and metal armor clanking against each other began to ring from the bottom of the stairs. The skeleton with shining green eyes slowly walked up and stood on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A tall skeleton knight, a Death Knight, appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He silently gazed at the minibuses parked on the street in the night. Torn human flesh was strewn here and there, covered with blood, but thanks to their sacrifices, those inside the bus survived.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he looked inside the window, his children in his wife’s arms gently lifted their heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Skeleton?” One of them shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But they couldn’t recognize their father.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that time, a ghoul jumped between them. The ghoul, drooling, ran towards the bus. The boy snuggled in his mother’s arms, startled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Argh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just before the ghoul’s fingers touched the window, the skeleton cut him in half, his green eyes flashing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle – Rattle –<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ghouls turned their attention to the skeleton because he was of the same race as them, but he radiated an extraordinary force. For the ghouls, he was in a different league, with an air of nobility and displeasure.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Three ghouls charged at the Death Knight at the same time. He stood with his back against the bus and gently lifted his big sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as he wielded his sword, the head of the ghoul who ran first was severed neatly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, turning around to avoid its nails, he reached out with his left hand and grabbed the ghoul’s neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Its skull shattered and its eyeballs popped out when the skeleton squeezed him with tremendous force.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>He threw the ghoul at a power pole violently, and swung his sword vertically with his right hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chooak―<br/><br/><br/><br/>The blade slipped through the crotch of the third ghoul, who collapsed in no time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The three ghous were crushed in several seconds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok, who turned into a Death Knight, possessed tremendous power far beyond what he could imagine when he was alive. He no longer felt tired, nor did he feel pain. Since he had no weak human flesh, his attack was more aggressive and violent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the ghouls did not give up because they didn’t fear him at all. To them, the Death Knight was no more than an annoying thing who interfered with their meal. Two of them rushed towards the skeleton head-on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok held out his left hand towards them. Then, a black magic circle appeared in the palm of his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two black chains protruded from the magic circle and crawled toward them like a snake, coiling around their heads and limbs tightly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they screamed, he pulled his left hand and swung his sword with his right hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two ghouls were cut in half immediately before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 9,000 gold by hunting ghouls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Time remaining until you prove your qualification: 4,324 days<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 9,000 gold by hunting ghouls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Time remaining until you prove your qualifications: 4,304 days<br/><br/><br/><br/>A series of messages floated before Sungwoo’s eyes while he was climbing the stairs after the Death Knight. Sungwoo came out, stood on the ground and looked around. Suddenly, the situation was under control.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were numerous ghoul corpses, as well as human bodies. Among them was a man standing, who was a living corpse.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His profile appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Contractor Profile]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Minsok Ahn<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Level: 12<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Job: Death Knight<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Ability: Muscle strength (30), agility (20), stamina (30)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Attribute: Knight, Undead<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Contractor skill information (summary)]<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Abyssal Chain: Summons a chain with the power of death to bind a specific target.<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Exploitation of Life: Absorbs the soul of the living to strengthen oneself and the surrounding undead. (10% increase per one. Up to five.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok picked up a shield that fell on the ground. Since it was half crushed by the ghouls’ nails, he could not use it any longer, though he had been using it from the beginning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Feeling sorry for the loss of his shield, he turned his head to look inside the bus. He made eye contact with his young son, but he could not open his mouth. In fact, there was no point of him opening his mouth as he only had bones left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I think it’s over. But what is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While approaching him, Jisu looked at the Death Knight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ll explain it to you later.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at the dim green sign at the end of the minibus headlight. It was marked Beomgye Station with an arrow pointing straight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, let’s go straight to Beomgye Station. This time it’s our turn to attack them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They had no time to take a rest. The shoe was on the other foot now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was time for them to bring real death to the monsters there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They stopped in front of the entrance to Beomgye Station that housed two department stores in the same station building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Certainly that black smoke has become thicker than before,” Minsok said, moving his jawbone. While he was looking at Beomgye Station, he sometimes glanced at the bus with his family on it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you not going to tell your family about your transformation?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I’m afraid I can’t for now. Besides, we have a more urgent mission now. I can tell them later when our mission is over. No matter how scared they will be at seeing me, my sons are patient enough to not cry.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, it was not easy for him to stand before his family as a skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The disappearance of their father would be a shock to them, but it would be another matter for them to accept the skeleton as their father.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Jisu walked out of the black smoke. She stumbled, wearing a gas mask.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Cough! Cough!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She coughed while removing her gas mask. Then, she touched the floor with her hands, dry heaving.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you alright?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, gas masks are useless…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The smoke rising from Beomgye Station became thicker. It was so toxic that even the gas masks they had prepared could not protect them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ma, that’s what they called the breakdown of balance.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo shook his head when Minsok said that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sugnwoo said, “There has never been such a thing as balance in this game.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since there was no balance, there was no collapse.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, let me and Minsok go in first. So, please protect the survivors. Just hide in a nearby building that’s as safe as possible.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu felt a bit uneasy since she could not help Sungwoo, but she could not help it anyway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please protect my family,” Minsok said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, yes. Don’t worry about that,” she nodded at him with a smile. Someone had to be left behind for the survivors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Before entering Beomgye Station, Minsok couldn’t approach the bus, looking at his family members at a distance. His youngest son was seen whining in his mother’s arms.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Mom! Mom! Dad? Where is Dad?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Mom! Did Dad get caught by a zombie like Hyunjoon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsuk’s wife couldn’t answer her sons’ questions. However, she just blankly stared at the Death Knight standing at a distance. Her eyes trembled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, let’s go.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok turned his head with effort.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The undead army, led by Lich and the Death Knight, disappeared into the black smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was emptier inside Beomgye Station than Sungwoo expected. There were several zombies and corpses ripped apart by the zombies, but there was nothing other than that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they went inside the station, the smoke faded, rising only near the ceiling, but the Breath of the Abyss was activated only around the station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘As expected, they released the Breath of Abyss to block the outsiders’ access.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Given the situation until now, there was a higher possibility that the research facility of the Evolution Society was actually inside Beomgye Station. Obviously, the Breath of Abyss was installed to block the players from getting inside the station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Then, what happened to the Raid Boss?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>What Sungwoo could guess from the monsters’ memories and maps at Sindorim Station was that the Raid Boss was “detained” here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If that’s the case, the guys of the Evolution Society didn’t bother even if they could easily find and “hunt” the Raid Boss here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The Raid Boss monster is definitely alive!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The “local quest” issued after midnight was also highly likely to be a kind of sub-mission for the Raid Boss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The question here was how they could go as far as “detaining” the Raid Boss when they could easily hunt him?<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Maybe I can find out if I hunt the monster.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>What Sungwoo could do at the moment was to find the Raid Boss’s room somewhere inside the station. Sungwoo and Minsok went down the stairs. The black smoke rising from the basement served as a guide.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It leads to the underground tunnel.” </div><h2 id="chapter115">Chapter 115</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Just like Minsok said, the smoke coming from the ceiling of the station building led into the subway and tunnels.<br/><br/>Sungwoo stuck his head out and lit the flashlight on the repeating crossbow. However, the ray of light did not go far. There was only endless darkness like the throat of a giant marine animal.<br/><br/>“Let’s go inside.”<br/><br/>They jumped off the railroad tracks and walked.<br/><br/>Tramp–Tramp–<br/><br/>However, the deeper Sungwoo walked through the tunnel, the stranger he felt about this particular place. It was an empty space with nothing special, which made him more suspicious.<br/><br/>He soon noticed why he felt so strange. Obviously, this place had been left unattended after the fall of this place, but there was no pool of water inside.<br/><br/>‘Suwon Station was half flooded.’<br/><br/>Underground facilities such as this were inevitably susceptible to flooding, so they needed the constant management of drainage facilities and water pumps, but this place wasn’t flooded at all.<br/><br/>‘If that’s the case, somebody is managing this place?’<br/><br/>Of course, since Sungwoo was not fully aware of the geographic situation of this place, it’s possible this underground place was well managed.<br/><br/>His suspicion turned out to be correct.<br/><br/>“What’s that?”<br/><br/>It was beginning to be brighter little by little, then a white light poured out from ahead.<br/><br/>Then, a white plastic curtain appeared and blocked the whole passage, but could be opened and closed with a zipper. It seemed like a kind of temporary quarantine facility.<br/><br/>“I used to see it in zombie movies. Isn’t that the mark of the government?”<br/><br/>On the left side of the entrance door, where Minsok pointed, the Taegeuk mark, the symbol of the Korean government, was attached. Below it was the description of the facility.<br/><br/>-Ministry of Public Administration and Security: Disaster Response Committee<br/><br/>-Quarantine Test Facility B-2<br/><br/>– Off limits to outsiders<br/><br/>“I think this is a government facility, given this kind of sign,” Minsok said.<br/><br/>Sungwoo frowned at his remark.<br/><br/>“I think the problem is whether the people here are public servants or not.”<br/><br/>The reason why Sungwoo came here was to find the crazy guys behind the Evolution Society, but it was an unexpected government facility that greeted him.<br/><br/>What’s the relationship between the insane scientists who have been making mysterious plots and the government that disappeared at the start of the game?<br/><br/>‘Can it be true that the Evolution Society guys are from the government?’<br/><br/>Of course, it was possible that the key government officials drew cards and became players. If that’s the case, they, too, were influenced by the quests, so they must be struggling to survive somewhere.<br/><br/>Even though they lost all the vested interest and power due to the collapse of the government, it’s possible that they were maintaining a large group somewhere because they used to govern the Republic of Korea.<br/><br/>‘Whatever it is, it is no longer an organization we can trust and follow.’<br/><br/>Even if such a surviving power group was still functioning somewhere, it was not appropriate to call them ‘the government.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo opened the zipper and entered the cylindrical vinyl area. Then, another door appeared ten meters away. It was as if there was something like a terrible virus beyond that door, so they seemed to have quarantined it in multiple ways.<br/><br/>Rattle-<br/><br/>He opened the second door and entered. Then, a facility with a relatively high ceiling appeared. Several pieces of experimental equipment were installed inside the tunnel, which measured four meters in height and eight meters in diameter. And there appeared something terrible before their eyes.<br/><br/>“Ugh?”<br/><br/>-Raid Boss monster ‘Ghoul King’ has appeared.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuueeeeeeh!<br/><br/>Finally, the Raid Boss monster appeared, but it was not complete.<br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/>Inside a huge vinyl tube was a huge purple ghoul, with his limbs cut off, bound with a white chain. A white magic circle over his head circled and restricted his movement.<br/><br/>That helpless guy was the Raid Boss monster, “Ghoul King.”<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Abyssal Rift’ is being generated in the affected area.<br/><br/>And with such a warning message, a purple portal began to open toward the tunnel on the other side of the tube.<br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeh! Kueeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/>Then, dozens of zombies poured out from there and ran out like crazy into the darkness of the tunnel. Immediately, after they came out, three ghouls crawled out.<br/><br/>Fortunately, there was a screen made of tempered glass between the portal and the facility, so the undead did not come towards them.<br/><br/>“Now I think I know why zombies have been pouring out. It’s like a hen that keeps laying eggs,” Sungwoo said calmly.<br/><br/>Minsok gnashed his teeth and said, “Who the hell did something like this….”<br/><br/>At that moment, the door of the facility on the left opened and someone walked out.<br/><br/>“It was you, Necromancer, as I expected.”<br/><br/>He was in a black suit. He was tall, with pomade-styled hair. His face was familiar to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>‘I didn’t expect to encounter this guy here.’<br/><br/>This was the guy who had sent the director and the white Werewolf to Sindorim Station.<br/><br/>A couple of his deputies also came out. One of them was a man in a white cassock and a shoulder cape, and the other was a woman in glasses.<br/><br/>The woman looked at Sungwoo then sneered at him.<br/><br/>“Suddenly, the quest was upgraded, so I released more smoke. I wondered who could get through that thick smoke and come as far as here. Man, the guinea pig that we have wanted to collect came to our place voluntarily.”<br/><br/>Then, she looked at Minsok and said, “Gosh, what the heck is this? Skeleton knight? Oh, you’re sexy!”<br/><br/>“I’m sorry to say this, but you’ve got three, or you had three children…”<br/><br/>Minsok wanted to grab his sword as if he was about to charge at them and swing. He realized they were responsible for this terrible situation.<br/><br/>“Now, let’s stop staring at each other for a moment. Just in case, let me make a suggestion.”<br/><br/>The pomade-styled man came forward one step closer.<br/><br/>“Well, it seems we haven’t had a good relationship until now. But I think we made a mistake in the beginning. So, if we have a conversation, I think we can satisfy our interests together.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t reply, but the man continued, not caring at all, “You’ve chosen a death-related job, and I’m working on death, though it’s completely different.”<br/><br/>“You said you are researching death?”<br/><br/>The pomade-styled man reached out and pointed to the Ghoul King in custody.<br/><br/>“As you know better than anyone, this is the Energy of the Abyss. It is the power that is opposite to all life.”<br/><br/>And the resulting products of that were several bombs and gas weapons that released the Breath of the Abyss.<br/><br/>“Let me cut to the chase. I and my colleagues regard this event as a trial, or a test for the evolution of human beings. Whoever we give the trial has to overcome and pass the test. And the way to do it is to throw away our existing system and transcend it.”<br/><br/>Youido, the new human race, and transcendence: Sungwoo heard all of these concepts from the director.<br/><br/>“We regard the beginning of our work as an escape from death. So, we’ve been working on death and the abyss, and in this chapter, surprisingly, as if we were on the right track, a raid boss called Ghoul King appeared in this area. It was a golden sample for us.”<br/><br/>The pomade-styled man, who was pointing at the Ghoul King, turned to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“And now, you’ve come to this place, Necromancer.”<br/><br/>“It looks like somebody is helping our work,” the woman in glasses said, giggling.<br/><br/>The man continued, “You may think everything seems to be a coincidence in this game, but it is being manipulated by an artificial system. It is the result of the quest that you and I are meeting face to face like this. That means there is already the answer. It’s the ending of the game.”<br/><br/>“Ending of the game?”<br/><br/>“Yeah. We intend to be the main characters in that ending.”<br/><br/>The man paused for a moment, then calmly continued, “Necromancer, we saw a happy ending of this game through a special opportunity, so we know the destination we have to reach. We are standing at the great intersection leading to the ending at this moment. In other words, you have to decide whether you want to join us as our colleague or turn your back on us as our enemy…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo frowned at that point.<br/><br/>‘Happy ending? The ending of the game? Does the Evolution Society have the prediction stone of the happy ending?’<br/><br/>At that moment, the pomade-styled man approached Sungwoo one step closer and said, “Now, why don’t you share our great cause? It will do you good, too.” </div><h2 id="chapter116">Chapter 116</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The pomade-hair guy looked at Sungwoo with a calm expression. He didn’t ask Sungwoo a favor. Actually, he offered something like a proposal, but Sungwoo hardened his expression at that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What cause are you talking about when you’re only a horse in this chess game?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t like the way you speak to me. Since you look down on the great cause I mentioned, I’m so disappointed, and I have to deal with you duly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just like the Vampire Road and Youngdungpo Prosecutor, another guy bragging about his great cause appeared. Sungwoo wasn’t interested in their ideas or philosophy at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Above all, he didn’t want to compromise with these guys who sprayed poison gas on the survivors and cut people into pieces to make drugs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The pomade-hair guy turned, then said, “Well, good. Let me cut to the chase because this is an era in which we forget about our reason. Hey, Sungkook!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man in the white, standing silently, stepped forward. He pulled a little wand from his pocket.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Doctor, let me free the Ghoul King for some time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, we have to be ready then.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The breakdown of the negotiations meant a fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Guards, don’t come out and wait inside because you could disturb me casting the spell.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man holding the wand spoke towards the door, then stared at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This guy is a clergy type.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, he had an occupation that was directly opposed to the undead. The magic that overpowered the Ghoul King was also most likely opposite to Sungwoo’s, he thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo moved the skeletons including Minsok and ghouls standing at the entrance. At that moment, three more people emerged from the front door. They, too, were priests holding wands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Smash all the undead!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, a light flashed from their wands, then a white magic circle began to be drawn on the floor. It was large enough to cover the entire tunnel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“All ready!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Start it now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woooooong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The stats of your subordinate spirits are drastically reduced by divine power. (-60%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s subordinate spirits, the undead, rushed quickly toward them, but their movement was slowed due to the debuffs in play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump! Thump! Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Except for Sungwoo, all the undead were thrown into the back wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed to be the countermagic of the undead attribute and was so powerful that it caused a crack in the outer wall of the tunnel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pick! Pick! Pick! Pick!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo fired a barrage of repeating crossbows. But when the woman in glasses raised her hand, the arrows stopped in the air, turned 180 degrees, and flew back toward Sungwo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In an instant, the bone shield was separated from the bone armor, completed clumsily, and blocked the arrows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok was stuck behind the iron gate of the facility. Although he felt no pain, he felt dizzy because he was thrown into the air all of a sudden. He stood up, grabbing the half-folded iron gate with his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungkook, be careful. There is an experiment tank in the wall over there. When it breaks, we’re going to be in big trouble,” the pomade-hair man shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, yes!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having heard that, Minsok turned his head and looked inside the door. Like the pomade-hair man said, there was a huge tank over there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And he noticed something floating in the tank.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Bring them up again! Smash the infiltrators!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The priest named Sungkook yelled at them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo pondered over how to attack them, waiting for their inevitable attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Since the tunnel is too narrow, I can’t summon large skeletons. Even if I could summon them, they are useless in this narrow tunnel.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At best, it was about 4 meters high inside the tunnel, so it was impossible for Sungwoo to summon Bone Drake or Ogre Skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“All ready!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While Sungwoo was agonizing over his strategy, they were attacking him again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me start…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even before the priests joined hands for synergy effect, a man on the far left soared into the air all of a sudden. There was a black chain wrapped around his neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Cough! Kuuuuuuh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The Death Knight exploits life. (Step 1)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The stats of nearby undead increase. (+10%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, the Death Knight was grabbing his neck tightly. However, he fixed his eyes on the tank inside the iron gate in the back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hubble-bubble―<br/><br/><br/><br/>People’s heads were floating inside the tank.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I really can’t forgive these bastards…” Minsok shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The heads belonged to the survivors kidnapped by the ghouls. He was not exactly sure, but it seemed that a little boy’s head slowly sank and disappeared inward.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our enemy is the undead anyway! Smash them with divine magic!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the priests lifted their wands, the arrows of light poured out toward the Death Knight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, it was the magic that was fatal to the undead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo improvised a bone shield in a hurry, and Minsok picked it up quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Synergy effect’ is given due to your team play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/><br/><br/>4) Indomitable Knight (Complete)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Hidden Synergy<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: Undead + Knight + Shield<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: When defending with a shield, you gain ‘immunity’ against ‘abnormal state’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I definitely need a shield.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok’s green eyes started to burn intensely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The mightiest of Sungwoo’s subordinate spirits was Bone Drake, and the next powerful was Ogre Skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two monsters had unrivalled strength compared with other skeletons because they were basically from the Raid Boss monster race. However, their overwhelming size sometimes imposed restrictions on their movement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As they already showed it in their battle with the ghouls, it was difficult for them to respond to the small and quick guys timely because they could not move around quickly due to their enormous weight, but there was another big problem: Sungwoo could not use them indoors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘That is why the Death Knight is more special to me than any other subordinate spirit.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Death Knight, namely Minsok, was an undead with an overwhelming force despite his humanoid size.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wearing armor all over his body and carrying a huge shield, he moved about the battlefield without feeling pain. So, his presence itself was formidable to the enemy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A white magic circle flew toward Minsok, the Death Knight, but it scattered into the air after hitting his shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? My magic doesn’t work!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Cast the spell again!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t that the magic didn’t work. The damage caused by divine power was certainly effective, but it failed to fly toward the wall because of the synergy effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the Death Knight’s black chain shot out like a viper’s head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the woman wearing glasses reached out to protect the clergies, she had to confront Sungwoo when he lifted the repeating crossbow to aim at her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pick! Pick! Pick! Pick!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Don’t disturb me!” the woman shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She stopped controlling the arrows telekinetically and threw them back towards the Death Knight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, there was no chance that the Death Knight would suffer damage from such arrows. The arrows bounced off helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Death Knight stepped forward with great strides after breaking the neck of the priest he had just grabbed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Death Knight exploits life. (Step 2)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The stats of nearby undead increase. (+20%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘divine power ‘ of the area disappears.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the players controlling the spell were killed, the abnormal condition based on divine power was dissolved. In other words, the leash that was holding the monsters was broken. Soon, the undead behind the Death Knight began to move again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Summon the security guards!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The priest named Sungkook shouted hastily. When he realized that his forces could not confront Sungwoo’s forces on their own, contrary to their expectations, he started looking for the security guards they had left behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it was already too late. The ghouls rushed at terrific speed, then rushed from all directions on the ceiling and walls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The priests who lacked direct combat skills had no way of avoiding the ghouls’ attack. The woman in glasses hurriedly shook her left hand to push the ghoul away from a priest, but the priest died instantly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come out, everybody! Hurry up!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Belatedly ten security guards waiting inside the door began to come out quickly. They, too, seemed to be players with quite high levels.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Those with shields, move forward!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fire at once!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, they couldn’t survive long in a narrow tunnel, surrounded by a number of undead. Even before they got out of the door, they fell prey to the tankers at the forefront.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ghouls roamed freely on the hemispherical ceilings and attacked the security guards running out of the narrow door.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Where are they coming from? Look at the ceiling!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ghouls bit and took them into the corner, then began to cruelly slaughter them.<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter117">Chapter 117</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>When the situation got worse before their eyes, the security guards, who hesitated to come out the door, chose to stay inside the door as the inside of the tunnel was literally like a living hell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s hold out here! Kill all the undead coming through the door! Those with shields, step forward!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wizards, prepare the spell in advance!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it wasn’t the undead that flew in front of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the body of their colleague, swelling and green.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was an explosion inside the door, then the undead began to crawl through the broken door.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Help! Help!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Amid the chaotic situation Sungwoo aimed at the two remaining priests. They emitted a beam of sacred light to push out the undead, their arch-nemesis, but it was almost impossible for them to avoid the ruthless attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pick! Pick! Pick! Pick! Pick!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have gained 12,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have gained 10,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those priests fighting separately were no more than easy prey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On one side, there was fierce fighting going on between the woman using telekinesis and the Death Knight. To put it accurately, they were engaged in a chase.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get lost! Get out of my face!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shouting at the top of her lungs, the woman stretched out her hand violently. Whenever she did, she forcibly pushed out the Death Knight telekinetically. At the same time, her two daggers flew in the air and scratched the body of the Death Knight here and there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang! Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Minsok, the Death Knight, was an experienced swordsman, so he struck back the flying daggers pretty easily. The daggers that bounced off were thrown into the floor and firmly stuck there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Go away! Ahhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The woman desperately tried to push the Death Knight away, but the Death Knight got closer to her as if he broke through a strong gust. Now, he stood right before her with his green eyes shining brightly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get out of my face! Get lost, you monster! Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 12,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the woman’s screaming stopped, it became silent inside the tunnel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only the pomade-hair man stood among the numerous bodies of his minions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nonetheless, he opened his mouth with a cool expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You guys are great.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he slowly raised his left hand. Then, something like a particle spewed out of his watch, and it quickly gathered on the palm of his hand, forming a flask.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I have no combat skills, so I struggled every time in the fight.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After saying that, he threw the flask at Sungwoo and the undead. An electric current burst out, along with an explosion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The undead were instantly entwined with a net-like current and fell into a state of immobility. In the meantime, the pomade-hair guy stepped back and formed another flask on his palm. This time it was green.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time it exploded nearby, then vines and stems began to grow out of it explosively. Sungwoo charged at him and picked up the “Grim Reaper” that appeared in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You now obtain the power of ‘Lich’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Your subordinate spirits increase up to (+50).<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All stats increase by (+10).<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You can resurrect and regenerate the destroyed undead’ nearby indefinitely as many as the maximum number of your subordinate spirits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, Sungwoo’s body was gnawed by a green flame, and at the same time, his bones began to appear. Then, he swung the huge sickle horizontally.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The heap of vines that were growing like gourds were severed with a single stroke. The stems and leaves of the vines fell in all directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the Grim Reaper’s attack range was wide and his stats increased a lot when he became Lich, Sungwoo could easily defeat the pomade-hair man’s tricks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The pomade-hair man seemed surprised at Sungwoo’s unexpected attack, but he was already preparing another flask.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a light and explosion at the same time. It was a flash bang. Obviously, he planned to block Sungwoo’s vision and do another trick, but Sungwoo rushed to him instantly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, the pomade-hair man hardened his expression because he was faced with another unexpected situation. But he quickly burst into laughter and said, “Oh, I see. One of your eyes is not real, but you can still see without a light receptor!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since there was no human eyeball in Sungwoo’s left eye after his transformation, it was impossible for the flash bang to take any effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the two flasks failed to work according to his plan, he was quickly pushed against the wall by Sungwoo. He immediately stretched out his right hand toward Sungwoo charging at him. His bracelet spread out from side to side and turned into a small crossbow. He fired the crossbow violently, but the arrows flew behind Sungwoo’s back without causing any damage. Sungwoo lifted the giant scythe and began to swing it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A half-moon-shaped steam of blood splattered on to the wall. His right shoulder was cut off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like he said, he didn’t have a combat-oriented job, so he could not defend against the attack of Sungwoo and his increased stats. The pomade-hair man was struggling desperately for survival.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it…You picked a really good card. It’s the best card to protect yourself, but how could you defend others?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck are you talking about?” Minsok asked quickly as he was bothered by his last word. It was a sensitive matter for him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you asking me now because you don’t know it? Where do you think the zombies and ghouls went? It’s not just the energy of the abyss that we’re working on. We’re developing the method of turning every element of this system into a weapon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bastard!” Minsok shouted and walked toward him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the pomade-hair guy raised his finger in a relaxed manner, as if to ignore Minsok.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What he pointed to was the “Ghoul King.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo turned his head, the white chains and divine spells that were binding the Ghoul King were gone, and his wounds were recovering.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The pomade-hair man said, “You seem to have too much work to get out and save somebody. Real power doesn’t mean just protecting your own life. Let me see if you can fight us to the end when everything around you is gone.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, he was desperately struggling to buy time as much as possible. He was not fighting for what he called a great cause, but to get Minsok and Sungwoo into trouble.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sngwoo turned his back and said to Minsok, “Kill him as brutally as possible.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though he heard them, the pomade-hair man showed no sign of resisting. He just smiled at Sungwoo feebly and said, “See you again.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok stabbed his chest with the sword, then raised it high. With his face turning white, the pomade-hair man kneeled. But his body turned into powder and disappeared before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Wasn’t he a human?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 13,000 gold by destroying the player’s ‘Clone-002’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked closely at the message before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Clone?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo accessed the community bulletin and checked the ranking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Oh, one is missing!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was no more the nickname ‘DOCTOR-002’, which was in the top 10 rankings until yesterday. He remembered that there were as many as five people called ‘DOCTOR’ within the top 20 rankings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This is why this organization was so large.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo now began to have a clear grasp of this mysterious group of the pomade-hair man. They were actually just one. Numerous “clones” of one man spread across the country and were pursuing the same goal at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was only one, but he was working like an organization, which was similar to the Vampire Lord but would act more powerfully.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay, let’s get rid of that monster as soon as possible.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head and looked at the Ghoul King. After breaking loose from the divine magic, the monster healed to some extent by regenerating part of his body while the pomade-hair man was desperately struggling to buy time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>If he could have his way, Minsok wanted to run to his family at once, but he could not because the Ghoul King began to tear out of the plastic tube.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tramp! Tramp!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Ghoul King’s severed limbs were revived and grew again in an instant. Then, moving the red limbs that had not yet been reassembled firmly, the Ghoul King began to crawl toward them at great speed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The target of the Ghoul King was Sungwoo, the only living being in this place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pick! Pick! Pick! Pick! </div><h2 id="chapter118">Chapter 118</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>After deactivating the summoning of the Grim Reaper, however, Sungwoo stepped back and fired a barrage of the repeating crossbow. Numerous arrows were stuck in his head and neck, but Sungwoo could not stop this monster, who was about 5 meters tall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>While stepping back, Sungwoo waited for the monster to approach the players’ bodies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tunnel was narrow, so the monster inevitably had to climb onto the bodies. The moment about 8 bodies were trampled under the monster’s feet, there occurred an explosion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as there was a huge explosion, the monster’s body was thrown into the air, scattering dust and stone dust in all directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His right arm, which was not yet recovered, was cut off, and his abdomen was completely torn apart. Nevertheless, he tried to move forward desperately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But at that moment Minsok’s chain wrapped around one of his remaining arms.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately moved the Werebear skeleton to pull the chain with Minsok.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monster’s forearm, which was not healed yet, began to be torn apart, unable to withstand the tension. His muscles ruptured and ligaments broke. Then, his skin was peeled off, revealing his white bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Losing his limbs again, the Ghoul King struggled desperately. Since he had been detained by the guys of the Evolution Society for a long time, he was almost dead until now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok, the Death Knight, walked toward the emaciated Ghoul King.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching them, Sungwoo muttered, “Come to think of it, you guys leave behind a gift all the time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Ghoul King was the second raid boss monster they left behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was widely believed that while Sungwoo and Minsok were away, the ghouls would eat the survivors in the buses easily, but Sungwoo didn’t think so because Jisu was there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although her brilliant activities were eclipsed by Sungwoo, the Necromancer, she was also a strong player with Level 13 as well as No. 8 in the Korean server rankings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haaaaa! Haaaaa!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Letting out a sigh, Jisoo stood tall on the third floor of a franchise cafe in the shopping mall near Beomgye Station. Zombie and ghoul corpses were strewn around her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haaaa…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After catching her breath, she rubbed the blood on her hands on her pants. Then, she grabbed her sword once again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is it all over now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The survivors gathered in the corner of the cafe. Those who could fight were protecting the elderly and children.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu quietly closed her eyes without replying. Then, she opened up all her senses and caught all the vibrations of this building: the sharp sound of somebody scratching the stair handrails, the vibrating of empty pipes, the sound of the exterior walls of the building crumbling, and the disgusting breath of the monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nope, it’s not over yet. They are coming back again!” Jisu replied, at last.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as she said that, the window in front of her was broken, and a purple-skinned monster popped in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanging from the ceiling, the monster rushed at her, aiming for her neck. That wasn’t the end. Two zombies came in from the emergency exit on the left and rushed toward her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Parents embraced their children. A couple of men hurried to help her deal with the zombies in the emergency exit, but a ghoul immediately joined the two zombies to attack Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Another ghoul?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was not one, but several ghouls coming out everywhere now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Jisu moved without hesitation. As soon as the ghoul charged at her from the ceiling, she turned to the left and swung her sword. The ghoul was beheaded. His head fell on the ground and his body slid towards the survivors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, she turned her head and went around the two men stepping back, scared. At the same time, she took her right hand off the hilt and swung her sword with her left hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ghoul’s right arm was cut off and fell to the side, but she stepped forward to confront the two zombies right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She swung her sword about two steps away from the zombies. At that moment, the energy of the sword was unleashed at once, throwing them into the air. She immediately turned at a right angle and looked at the ghoul’s severed arms.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly, the ghoul approached right behind her, then swung its left hand towards her head, but she lowered her head and swung her sword at the ghoul’s head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A handful of the ghoul’s hair was cut in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, its left wrist was severed. With both hands lost, the ghoul stuck out its head as a last resort and opened its mouth towards her neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu stabbed her sword into its chest, then pushed it with all her might.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She bent her legs and tightened her shoulders before lifting the blade of the sword vertically to cut the ghoul’s head and heart with a single stroke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 9,000 gold by hunting a ghoul.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haaaaaaah…Whew!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The left side of her face and neck were covered with blood. Her right side was also stained with blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the two men who stepped out to help her looked at her blankly, as if they were shocked by her tremendous fighting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As an expressionless swordsman with blood all over her body, she looked terrifying to them now. But at that moment, she frowned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang! Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They attacked her again. She grabbed the hilt of her sword and turned around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She noticed somebody at that moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, guys!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A black chain was wrapped around the window frame, and a Death Knight appeared, pulling the chain. He was none other than Minsok. .<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s Dad’s voice!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dad? Dad!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The children raised their heads, but couldn’t run out. The man’s voice was definitely their father’s, but what they saw was the Death Knight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The second 6-year-old asked innocently, “Has our Dad changed to somebody else?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok, who flinched at that, nodded and replied, “Yeah, Uncle Necromancer helped me transform myself into a skeleton for a minute.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only then did they begin to feel relaxed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, my son!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! Cool!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I want to change, too!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo walked up from the stairs. While looking at the corpses of ghouls and zombies strewn all over the cafe, he saw Jisu face to face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I didn’t worry much because you were here, Jisu.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did you get rid of them all?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah. But things have gotten more complicated.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They could not continue the conversation because the system intervened again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-As of now, the mainstream ‘CHAPTER 2: When You’re Faced With Big Fate’ has ended urgently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those who saw the message whispered something among themselves here and there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is all this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ending urgently?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s over already? Then what else is coming next?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu also felt something ominous.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It looks like something else is about to happen.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I guess so.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Mainstream start guide]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-CHAPTER 2-1: The balance patch is urgent!<br/><br/><br/><br/>We would like to congratulate the survivors of the Korean server for your extraordinary attack instincts! You have completed all of your missions much earlier than the given time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Ranking of the raid boss monster hunting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Kangsok Han: 4<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) kor-157: 3<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Yoon Choi: 2<br/><br/><br/><br/>4) DOCTOR-000: 2<br/><br/><br/><br/>5) Hyonmin Jang: 2<br/><br/><br/><br/>6) Wrong choice: 1<br/><br/><br/><br/>7) DOCTOR-001: 1<br/><br/><br/><br/>(A total of 15 animals were hunted.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>[Attention!

In other words, a huge group of monsters bigger than the “Chief Orc” of the school or the “Lizardman Warrior” of Youido would appear, according to the message.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, this means it’s not good for us to wake up early, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, we will have to wait and see.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The “ending” of all this surely exists, but the thing is that there are several possible endings and several routes to the ending. In that respect, this event would also be one of the routes to the ending.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The variables are dangerous, but they will give us a greater reward.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>A bigger fight was approaching them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Of course, I welcome it.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the necromancer, Sungwoo didn’t have to fear a massive battlefield. </div><h2 id="chapter119">Chapter 119</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as it started, a simultaneous assault against the groups of survivors across the country began.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Praise of our overwhelming achievement? Damn it! Man, this is like telling us to die! This is something like hatred of Korea!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho ran down the corridor, shouting desperately. The main entrance of the museum was broken open by the massive attack of the monsters. He knew from the beginning that the physical barrier wouldn’t last long, so the only thing he could rely on was the shield in the Safety Zone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, there was the sound of monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeh! Keeeeeeek!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of goblins were chasing Hanho and Kyongsu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, they are just goblins!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho and Kyongsu thought these low-level monsters and goblins that only gave about 10 gold could not be a match for them, but they had to step back when they saw the monsters increasing by hundreds and thousands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get inside the building quickly!” Hanho’s father, Jungho, shouted at them from the end of the corridor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a translucent wall where he was standing. It was the boundary and shield of the Safety Zone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhh! Safe!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho and Kyung-soo barely managed to get into the Safe Zone. Right after they got inside, hundreds of goblins came running towards them in droves, but ran into the shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What did you say? Safe? Are you crazy, shouting like that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dad, you would not scold me like this if I had been stabbed in the back. You would have been crying by now. So, you’re lucky that your son has come here…!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Hanho stopped talking when he heard a thunderous noise behind him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, numerous goblins began to attack the shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The numbers appearing before Jungho’s eyes began to go down quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Pioneer Camp Shield (1455/1500)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Pioneer Camp Shield (1432/1500)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment the shield collapsed, it would be impossible for them to block the huge number of monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everyone, get ready for battle! Those with spears and shields, come forward!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kyongsu shouted, looking back at the survivors in the village.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They weren’t as weak as before. Although he survived by relying on Sungwoo, they kept beefing up their strength after that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In particular, before the Youngdungpo terrorist attack, the survivors gained experience dealing with various monsters while running a crackdown team.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Those with arrows and crossbows, and wizards, go to the rear row! We’re going to line up from side to side and fire at the monsters at my command!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wizards, come this way! Cast fire magic in advance! After that, prepare freezing and lightning magic!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sgt. Kim and Inho led the players who could mount a long-range attack. Since the number of those who could confront the monsters was over a hundred, they felt they would not be easily defeated this time, but they were not sure they could win.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Pioneer Camp Shield (988/1500)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, the monsters are breaking through our shield so quickly!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even before Sgt. Kim and Inho lined up the fighters, their shield had already been broken down by half.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jungho looked at his son with an anxious expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho sighed deeply and said, “Daddy…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Huh? Did you call me now? Why are you trying to look so serious?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you for raising me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He looked so gloomy at the moment when he said that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You don’t have to say what’s so obvious. I’m just confused why you are saying that now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, his gloomy expression was gone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He said, “Although you ruined the family because you were addicted to gambling, I learned the transience of life and a beggar’s behavior pattern thanks to you…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho, you can’t afford to talk nonsense anymore. We’ve got only 450, no 440 now before the monsters break through our shield.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it!” Hanho shouted, then pulled out daggers in both hands. He glared and threw himself out of the shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, he stabbed the dagger into the goblin’s neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There appeared a message before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 30 gold by hunting a low-level goblin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But that wasn’t all. Another message came up immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You get the ‘Holy Shield’ for 10 seconds with the skill of the ‘Slayer of Faith’. (200/200)<br/><br/><br/><br/>A golden shield was formed around Hanho’s body. It was the skill of Rogue + Priest that was activated at the moment he killed the enemy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alright, get out of the way!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Hanho began to storm boldly toward the middle of the enemy camp, but the goblins surrounding them beat at the shield while swinging their swords, but they could not break through the mighty shield with such attacks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Holy Shield (62/200)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Actually, it was a bit of a dangerous situation because the goblins kept inflicting minor damages to the shield, causing cracks here and there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Hanho also kept throwing daggers at the goblins, aiming at their necks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck!Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 30 gold by hunting a low-level goblin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 30 gold by hunting a low-level goblin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 60 gold by hunting a goblin attacker.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When ten seconds passed, another shield was formed. Although the goblins charged violently and ate away at the shield, the shield kept being generated before they ate it away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I think I’m pretty cool right now…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Swinging his arms like an inflatable doll, he rushed forward without any hesitation. As soon as he moved, a number of goblins’ bodies lined up just like a pile of laundry hastily gathered up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh! Let them all come! Argh! Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He screamed grotesquely and turned round and round like a spinning top. Maybe he was mistaken that he was the main character in a movie.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The survivors could not help but admire his brilliant attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He’s awesome, but something…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s not fun, but a little…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jungho also watched his son attacking the goblins brilliantly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, great! He’s terrific, but I’m not that proud…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho’s charge at the goblins was obviously terrific because the defense line within the Safety Zone was completed thanks to all the aggro directed toward Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I hate goblins! Dirty goblins! Let me kill you all!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While marching forward vehemently, he suddenly found something and stopped.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a goblin with only bones left standing before him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Orun? Are you Orun?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment numerous skeletons popped up behind Orun’s back. Then, they began to slaughter the goblins inside the museum.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Furthermore, outside the museum, Bone Drake, Ogre Skeleton, and Ghoul King who recently joined Sungwoo’s subordinate spirits smashed the goblins that filled the square.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the man wearing a dark green robe, Sungwoo, walked into the museum and swung a giant scythe. Five goblins were cut in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sunwoo! Sister Jisu!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer was back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Half a day has passed since a new mainstream was launched. According to the community bulletin, the vast majority of the survivor groups across the country suffered massive raids.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The idea that they would be safe inside the Safety Zone was overturned overnight, for the monsters formed a group to search for the last living places of human beings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I hear that they are dealing with thousands of orcs in Youngdungpo. Fortunately, they are in a lull after blocking their attack well, but they are looking for you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho told Sungwoo after confirming the article in the community bulletin. The reason they were looking for Sungwoo now was because he promised to defend them after he received a huge sum of one million gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, I have to go back there soon. I told Junghoon about it beforehand.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly after he attacked the monsters at Beomgye Station, a helicopter sent from Youngdungpo arrived. After helping the survivors get on the helicopter bound for Youngdungpo, he headed south with Jisu to the village in Suwon.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I can’t believe how the Safety Zone was broken through like this. We’re going to be in big trouble if the guys of the Evolution Society already moved.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Was it because Sungwoo kept moving that they didn’t find any loopholes in this village? Even those who had power around the country could not pay attention to every aspect of their place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘And at this moment, they must be being attacked too.’<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter120">Chapter 120</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            A little later Inho and his men returned from their scouting mission.<br/><br/>“We climbed up to the four tallest buildings in this neighborhood and looked around. A large group of goblins seemed to be coming from Mt. Paldal. It must be clear that they are located inside the mountains.”<br/><br/>Fortunately, the “warlord monsters” generated near the village were the weakest goblins.<br/><br/>If they were as powerful as Orcs, a step higher than them, Sungwoo would find it hard to confront them. Orcs are originally a race that engaged in large-scale wars, so when they increased in number and had a command system, they became incredibly strong.<br/><br/>The warlord monsters threatening Youngdunpo were none other than Orcs. To put it precisely, they were a slightly more powerful tribe called “Red Orcs.” There was a lot of chaos in the southwestern part of Seoul, Kimpo, and Incheon right now because of them.<br/><br/>“A helicopter is supposed to come to pick me up tomorrow morning. Let’s attack Mt. Paldal before the helicopter arrives here. Inho, can you estimate the size of the monsters in Mt. Paldal?”<br/><br/>Inho shook his head and said, “They were hiding among the trees, so I couldn’t observe them completely. However, when they first came out in droves, it seemed they numbered more than 2,000.”<br/><br/>Having heard that, Kyungsu began to add, “And they rode wild boars and there were even wizards there. The wild boars are really annoying. They make up for the goblins who lack the power to break through.”<br/><br/>It was clear that they were not to be taken as the same race as the existing goblins because they were in reinforced conditions as the nickname ‘warlord monsters’ suggested.<br/><br/>So, Kyongsu, Inho, and the village security force, who confronted the goblins only, could not hide their concern.<br/><br/>“No matter how weak goblins are, I’m afraid we are still on the defensive because they are numerically superior to us. When I confronted them, I knew they were well organized.”<br/><br/>Inho also nodded at that, and said, “I feel the same way. There are those in command, such as Chief Goblin and Captain Goblin. All the other goblins follow their direction with great loyalty. Since Sungwoo is with us, I don’t think we will lose, but I think we need to be a little more prudent to win the war instead of fighting in a hurry.”<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo had a different idea.<br/><br/>He said, “Our purpose is not to win the battle.”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“I’m going to focus on how much EXP and gold we can collect in the mountains. Not me, but you. Don’t you think this is a good opportunity?”<br/><br/>Kyongsu and Inho realized that the Necromancer in front of them thought differently from the way they thought.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was preparing for hunting, or harvesting, not fighting.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The command system was essential in carrying out a war. Strong leadership and a well-organized command system were essential elements that could qualify a being for the “warlord” title.<br/><br/>The command system given by the system transformed even barbaric monsters such as goblins into a powerful army.<br/><br/>Kruuuuuuuk!<br/><br/>An Orc-sized “Goblin Lord” sat at the edifice of the Tourism Information Center in Paldal Park, called the center of Mt. Paldal. Fifteen “Goblin Captains” lined up on his sides in an imposing manner. As the leadership of the goblin warlords, they gathered in one place now.<br/><br/>“Alright. Let’s blow away that whole building.”<br/><br/>Goblins are a stupid race. They appeared as a large group because of the mainstream, but once their leader was killed, they would most likely turn into a disorderly band of goblins as they used to be.<br/><br/>Based on such assumptions, Sungwoo made a simple plan.<br/><br/>“We’ll start the attack by removing their leader.”<br/><br/>His strategy was to start with killing the boss monster, then destroy the disorderly army under the leader to collect EXP and gold easily.<br/><br/>Sungwoo infiltrated the mountains alone to carry out the operation. The densely wooded mountains was the ideal place where the “Shadow King’s Robe” could show its highest efficiency, so Sungwoo reached the center of the goblin headquarters while avoiding the eyes of the goblin guards.<br/><br/>‘Come out.’<br/><br/>Then, he summoned one of his subordinate spirits from the rooftop of the Tourism Information Center building, where the ranking officers of the Goblin Army gathered.<br/><br/>With black smoke rising in the air, a white giant appeared out of it.<br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/>It was Ogre Skeleton who was more than eight meters tall.<br/><br/>Kieeeeeeeeeh! Kieeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/>The goblins who were camping around the building raised their heads blankly, confused by what was happening.<br/><br/>When Ogre Skeleton lifted his right hand, a blue flash of light began to radiate from his bracelet.<br/><br/>Kieeeeeeh! Kieeeeeeeh!<br/><br/>Frightened, the goblins picked up their weapons hurriedly, but it was too late. When it flashed, a tremendous electric current bounced off and evaporated the whole single-story concrete building.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>-You have earned 2,500 gold by hunting the ‘Goblin Captain’.<br/><br/>-You have earned 2,500 gold by hunting the ‘Goblin Captain’.<br/><br/>-You have earned 2,500 gold by hunting the ‘Goblin Captain’.<br/><br/>-You have earned 2,500 gold by hunting the ‘Goblin Captain’.<br/><br/>There were a total of 15 messages. The debris of the building flew into the air and fell to the hillside behind it. The bodies of the goblin captains were seen here and there through the debris.<br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrrl!<br/><br/>Only one goblin survived in the place where the building stood. It was none other than Goblin Lord, who was much larger than other goblins. Already seriously injured, he raised his head, gasping for breath.<br/><br/>“Can I take care of that guy? It’s been a while since I saw a goblin.”<br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle –<br/><br/>Holding a bone shield, the Death Knight with a black sword on his shoulders walked with heavy steps.<br/><br/>“Yeah. Kill him as soon as possible.”<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo was casting a glance at a different place. He fixed his eyes on the campsite behind the castle wall, located along the ridges, which was home to the main force of the goblin army numbering several thousands.<br/><br/>-You have summoned the ‘Grim Reaper’.<br/><br/>-Grim Reaper retention time (00:34:56)<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned the black scythe to use Lich’s power.<br/><br/>-You have gained Lich’s power.<br/><br/>* The maximum number of your subordinate spirits increases by (+50).<br/><br/>* All stats increase by (+10).<br/><br/>* You can resurrect and regenerate the undead destroyed nearby ‘indefinitely as many as the maximum number of your subordinate spirits.<br/><br/>Then, he summoned all the undead including skeletons and ghouls among the trees, and fifteen zombies around the campsite of the goblin’s main unit.<br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeeeh! Kueeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/>The goblins on standby in the camp were greatly confused when the creepy cries of the ghouls resonated through the mountains while they were approaching.<br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/>It was huge monsters approaching the goblins, shaking the earth, who they had never seen before.<br/><br/>But they were an army of their own, ready to fight at the order of the goblin leadership at any time.<br/><br/>-You have earned 105,000 gold by hunting the warlord monster ‘Goblin Lord’.<br/><br/>Now, their commander disappeared.<br/><br/>At that moment, their discipline collapsed in an instant, and the scene was like hell on earth.<br/><br/>Since the core officers of the goblin main unit, including the boss monster, evaporated in an instant, the remaining goblins under their command system became remnants overnight.<br/><br/>Kieeeeeeeeh! Kieeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/>They were no longer an army. Frightened, they started running away for survival.<br/><br/>Sungwoo controlled the undead that surrounded them from all directions and guided them in one direction, as if he was driving a herd of sheep.<br/><br/>“Why don’t we start a drive hunt?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo singled out the trash mobs, then drove them downhill, east of Paldal Park, namely in the direction of Namporu, where there were village players in ambush.<br/><br/>“They are coming! Get ready to fire!”<br/><br/>“Wow, there are so many out there!”<br/><br/>According to Sungwoo’s operation, they were quietly waiting to harvest the EXP and gold by killing the goblins.<br/><br/>A huge number of goblins jumped down the stone steps and hillsides, stunned.<br/><br/>The majority of goblins didn’t even hold weapons since they ran away hurriedly. Obviously, they completely lost the will to fight.<br/><br/>“What a jackpot! We can earn several times as many as what we earned while cracking down on them the hard way.”<br/><br/>“You know what? Hunting them is a piece of cake!”<br/><br/>The players in the village raised themselves, then lifted up their weapons, surrounding the path of their retreat in a semicircle. </div><h2 id="chapter121">Chapter 121</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Come on, get ready!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Some groups are devastated by a war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Right now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fire! Just pour it out!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sweep all of them with AOE magic!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Some groups use a war as an opportunity to grow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jackpot!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Gold keeps coming in!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And when the war is over, there is supposed to be a huge gap between the loser and the winner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>More than two hundred players appeared before a flock of goblins fleeing from the attack of the undead. All of them were holding long-range weapons such as arrows and crossbows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fire!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as the order was issued, they fired arrows and crossbows at once. The goblins collapsed helplessly without even a moment to escape from the attack, with the players blocking them from retreating.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Catch them, so they can’t escape!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Look to the left! Another flock of goblins are running away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 30 gold by hunting a low-level goblin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 28 gold by hunting a low-level goblin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 54 gold by hunting a low-level goblin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>An endless stream of messages of rewards appeared before the players in the village.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, how come hunting is so easy?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, you should not forget that Sunwoo has laid the foundation for our efficient fighting.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even Kyungsu and Inho who belonged to a high level thought their hunting was rather easy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>All players could not grow at the same speed. There were very few people who jumped into dangerous places like Sungwoo and actively hunted, looking for more and more powerful monsters, and that was why they were ranked the top players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the average level of the villagers was only 4. The same was true for other groups of survivors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The gap in their level is getting wider.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are a number of weak people in any group. Just like Jung Hoon said, they were the “dependant population,” who were a tremendous risk for the survivor groups.<br/><br/><br/><br/>For example, it was because of the old and the weak that a terrific knight like Minsok had to be trapped inside the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘When weak people are neglected, they become a great risk.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just like Sungwoo sent Hanho to the village for fear it would be attacked, the weak would most likely be a great risk for Sungwoo, too.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I can solve this problem. Even those who are inherently weak or sick can become stronger. That’s the system.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>No one is destined to be weak all the time. They can gain a skill by drawing a card like anyone else and strengthen their bodies through leveling up.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo decided to mobilize all the players in the village for this hunt, so both young children and old people took part in the fight, holding arrows and crossbows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, they would have been hunted unless Sungwoo had not created a special situation like this from start to finish.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sir, don’t worry and shoot calmly. When the monsters are approaching, we’re going to defend you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, boy, shoot now! Good job! You’re very talented!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everything was easy now. All they had to do was shoot long-range weapons at the weak monsters going downhill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sometimes some of the goblins broke through the attack and approached, but those players with combat experience stepped forward and stopped them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 2)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! I also leveled up! Finally!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, me, too! Me, too!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thanks to just one operation, such a large number of people who were classified as ‘dependent population’ began to function after proving themselves useful. At first these new players were clumsy and inexperienced in fighting the goblins, but soon they overcame fear and actively participated in the hunting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A little later the same message was displayed in front of all players on the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have successfully destroyed the “warlord monsters” on the first Korean server. (Biggest contributor: kor-157)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh! We have won!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can fight now, too! I’m level 3!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have won a large battle. Extra gold is issued to all the participants. (Differential payments based on their contribution)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, we’re receiving 2,000 gold at once?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I have already received 3,000!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And maintaining a useful group meant that Sungwoo could have a lot of capital.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The reason why Junghuoon, who was weaker than Sungwoo, could hire him was because he maintained such a group. Actually, he could easily collect one million gold by having the tens of thousands of survivors gathered in Yeongdeungpo chip in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Standing on the hill, Sungwoo watched them fighting the goblins. His operation was successful.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Yeah, these people can also be important weapons for me.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo has confronted various groups until now such as vampires, the army, the Evolution Society, etc. So, if he could create a group as large as that, they could serve as something like great insurance for him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next morning, Kyongsu reported to Sungwoo about the results of the battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The average level of the villagers was 3, but they have levelled up by double thanks to the previous battle. I haven’t yet counted the gold, but I think it will be huge. The problem is that the nearest store is in Suwon Station…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. From now on, we will run the monster crackdown task force with the purpose of getting rid of the monsters in this area on a larger scale.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you mean we can safely go outside now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, Sungwoo stopped them from going outside because of the danger of the Evolution Society. Although Sungwoo destroyed several facilities belonging to the group, they were still up and running, ready to retaliate against the survivors anytime.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Sunwoo said, hiding in a safe area didn’t mean they would get absolute safety because their Safety Zone could be destroyed, too.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, the only way for them to survive in this world was to be strong according to the rules of the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kyongsu, since we have eliminated the warlord monsters in this area, we will be able to hunt the monsters freely here, compared with other areas. Please try to make them achieve level 8 on average until I come back to this area.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the players in other regions were focusing on defending against the attack by the monster army, the players in the village could hunt relatively freely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Level 8… Sure, let me do my best to increase their level.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Achieving an average of level 8 wasn’t that easy. Even if everyone could join their hands to fight the monsters, it was not easy for them to reach that level. Except for a few of them, most of them would find it hard to achieve that level.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I have no obligation to take responsibility for the weak people here. I’m not going to come to your rescue even if something happens. So, you should try to protect yourselves. I hope you can remind them of my point,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah. I will not forget it either,” Kyongsu replied.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was not their guardian. So, he was always ready to take his hands off and leave.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mutual survival was only possible when they could support each other. So, the villagers had to prove that they could be helpful to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo! The helicopter has arrived! They are shouting you should get in urgently!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If they could not prove they could render support, they could pay the price for their protection, just like Youngdungpo Prosecutor did.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alright. Since I’ve received the money, let me go and protect them.” </div><h2 id="chapter122">Chapter 122</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The Crusader Team, the main force of the Liberation Guild, was positioned at the southern end of Yanghwa Road on the Han River. They, who were in a command vehicle converted from a bus, were monitoring the situation on Sunyu Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How about the movement of the enemy?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon got on the bus. When he asked, a wizard staring into the air turned his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, please wait a moment. Let me take a look at the northern boundary quickly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, the wizard turned his head to the front. Even now he was observing Sunyu Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyone with the wizard job could share a high-end item called a “magic drone,” so the wizard already flew a magic drone above the Sunyu Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A group of large monsters were moving in groups among the few buildings in the greenery of the island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were trolls. Numbering about 200, they were gathering toward the bridge, armed with wooden clubs and stone axes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Given their movement, I think they are going to come out soon… Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the magic drone was hit by something, lost its balance, and crashed on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It was shot down by a weapon like a slingshot.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum, who was next to him, suddenly stood up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander, we have to think about destroying the bridge. Currently thousands of Red Orcs are rushing in from Kimpo, so it is impossible for us to confront them on two fronts. We have to destroy the bridge, so we can confront the Red Orcs army coming from Anyangchon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The flock of “Red Orcs” that rose up from Kimpo were rushing in after occupying Kangso District. If they crossed Anyangchon, their next target was Youngdungpo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Because of this urgent situation, it would be a huge strategic loss for them to confront the troll troops that appeared on Sunyu Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How about mobilizing all the allied troops to get rid of the troll troops, then move on to the Anyangchon front?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Liberation Guild was operating a number of troops, aside from the Crusader Team. There were 300 Youngungpo security guards and allied troops such as Kangyoon Lee and Ansok Ku who participated in the Youido raid.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though they were classified as allies, they were actually subordinate to the Liberation Guild underJunghuoon’s command. They were currently gathering on the Anyangchon front to prepare for a battle against the Red Orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Trolls are not easy to deal with. If we engage in an all-out war because we are running out of time, we will suffer big damages. To make matters worse, if we have to confront the Red Orcs after that…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In that case, they would be faced with the worst battle. They were surrounded by enemies from all sides.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghun looked at Sunyu Island silently. At the end of the bridge, giant trolls were appearing one by one. As if he was so frustrated, Minhum opened his mouth, pressing his forehead with his fingers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, let me tell the security guards of Youngdungpo Station to come to this place except for the essential members.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the monsters’ terrorist attack took place while the Liberation Guild members were away, they had to pay particular attention to the security of the Youngdungpo headquarters now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, someone came in through the front door of the bus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Deputy! We have received a message from the helicopter that we sent to pick up the Necromancer. He’s going to arrive soon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What a relief! He won’t be too late. If the Necromancer joins us, we may be able to stop the trolls without sending our allies in Anyangchon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a moment of a little hope.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, by the way…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The member who conveyed the message seemed to have more to say.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Checking Junghoon’s expression, he opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“When I briefed the Necromancer about the situation on the front line, I was told that our Crusader team should get out of here and move to the Anyangchon front.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum said, frowning, “Uh? What the heck are you talking about? The troll troops are coming from the Sunyu Island right now. How can we move to Anyangchon instead of stopping them here? Did you brief him about the situation here, too?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, I did, but he said he would join us after collecting some bones…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Collecting bones?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Doodoodooo!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the thunderous noise of the helicopter rotors passed over their heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A strong gust blew over and made the bus windows rattle violently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A familiar firefighting helicopter flew low over the Yanghwa Bridge quickly. It was flying north where the troll troops were concentrated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The helicopter was hovering over the entrance to Sunyu Island for some time, then began to turn south quickly. At that moment, someone jumped down on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in that area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Death Response’ begins in that area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As black smoke erupted above the heads of the troll squads, they fell into great chaos and ran around wildly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That effect was typically activated when the Necromancer summoned a number of undead. And it wasn’t just a simple visual effect. If they breathed in that black smoke, they would be trapped in a “curse of death” and suffer damage. So, the trolls had no choice but to step back inside Sunyu Island, screaming in pain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeh! Kuuuuuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Terrible monsters popped out of the black smoke: Bone Drake, Ogre Skeleton, and Ghoul King. The three raid boss monsters were standing at the forefront.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, what the heck is that? There’s one more huge monster, isn’t it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bet! Trolls are also huge…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusaders couldn’t hide their admiration. Trolls were also large monsters over 4 meters tall, but they were like dwarfs before the raid boss monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ogre Skeleton ran to the forefront and swung his fists. Since he had the nickname ‘warrior,’ he was excellent at breaking through the trolls. The trolls who were nearby collapsed, then the ghouls ran over them and bit their necks ruthlessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- thump- thump- thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bone Drake and Ghoul King charged without hesitation towards those trolls who were staggering, losing their balance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the back of Bone Drake was a skeleton knight. He swung his sword at the necks of the trolls passing by him and threw the black chain around their necks, dragging them. His presence was a powerful addition to Bone Drake’s attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the battlefield, they killed the trolls, and there emerged the new undead, the “troll skeletons.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Collecting bones?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer was collecting bones as he claimed. In preparation for the upcoming war with the Red Orcs, he was creating a stronger force.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He was a tough guy from the beginning…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching the Necromancer collecting bones everywhere, Minhum muttered, “Man, he is like a fish in water.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The war was the best stage for the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum seemed to have a clear grasp of what was going to happen in this battle. He knew what would happen when the Necromancer who destroyed the troll troops joined the allied forces on the Anyangchon front.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Definitely dozens of giant undead will destroy the Red Orc army.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were not just dozens.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘These terrible monsters that neither tired nor died dominate the battlefield.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how hard he thought about it, he couldn’t think of how to surpass the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And after the war was over, the gap between Junghoon and the Necromance would be widened because death was an asset for the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was difficult for Sungwoo to handle the giant sickle “Grim Reaper.” Since he earned it only recently, he was not familiar with using it yet. Besides, it was so long and wide, and simply too heavy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the blade alone was 1.5 meters long. Since it had such a wide range of attack, just wielding it at random could be threatening enough to the enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In particular, it was quite effective because it could inflict a number of ​​deep wounds, which could delay the healing effect of the wounded trolls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo wrapped the Grim Reaper’s blade on the inside of the troll’s thigh and pulled it tightly, that giant monster fell, losing his balance. The muscles and tendons from his hips to the back of his knees were severed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Boounuuuung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>While rotating the Grim Reaper over his head, Sunwoo cut through the neck of the fallen troll.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 8,000 gold by hunting the ‘Troll Warrior’. </div><h2 id="chapter123">Chapter 123</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sungwoo actively made the most use of the Grim Reaper and Lich buffs that lasted for only one hour. Since his stats would increase drastically as long as he remained as Lich, Sungwoo could freely wield the huge scythe to kill his enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Booung! Booung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>By swinging the Grim Reaper horizontally, Sungwoo cut two trolls on the left and right side at the same time. Shortly afterwards, the Ogre Skeleton approached behind Sungwoo and covered the sun. A huge shadow covered Sungwoo’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a shadow alter ego was created with the ‘Ring of the Shadow King’ effect. In that condition, Sungwoo triggered the repeating crossbow, which sent off twice as many arrows as before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pick! Pick! Pick! Pick! Pick! Pick!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Argh! Ahhhhhhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A troll approaching Sungwoo fell with dozens of arrows all over his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 8,000 gold by hunting the ‘Troll Warrior’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After becoming Lich, Sungwoo did not simply play the role of commanding the battle, but also destroyed the enemy camp by freely using short-range and long-range weapons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the enemies did not easily collapse. Since they were a large-scale unit, the trolls in the rear poured out and filled in the empty ranks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Strange enough, the trolls rushed toward Sungwoo alone. Was it because they noticed that Sungwoo was in command of the undead and decided that they could win if they got rid of him?<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was not fighting alone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeh! Kueeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Ogre Skeleton, standing behind Sungwoo, punched and knocked both trolls back at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the skeleton was from a “fighter race,” he superbly threw his punch to smash the trolls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo made armor using the fallen troll corpses. This time the armor was unusually large, but it flew behind Sungwoo and attached to the Ogre Skeleton’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The figure of an 8-meter warrior in bone armor was majestic and bizarre. The trolls in the rear used slingshots like catapults, which only destroyed part of his bone armor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- Thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ogre Skeleton ran forward, grabbing the troll’s head, lifting it, and throwing him at the trolls using slingshots. Three trolls got entangled and fell down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump! Thump! Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then he kicked and punched them one after another, crushing the faces of the leading troll warriors. It was as if a giant gorilla attacked a herd of chimpanzees.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This wasn’t all. Bone Drake and the Death Knight behind his back were already fighting deep inside the enemy camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quaguaguaaaaa!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bone Drake twisted his pelvis and swung his tail. In one stroke, a group of trolls fell into a moribund state, and when they tried to raise their bodies, Sungwoo cut them with his sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, a black chain flew around and wrapped around the troll’s neck. At the same time, Bone Drake jumped the ground, and there was the sound of the trolls’ back being broken behind him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Ghoul King and the ghouls under his command were eating the trolls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the zombies, wearing full plate armor made of bones, blocked the trolls’ retreat and stuck to their legs to slow down their movement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, Orun used his small figure to get onto the trolls’ legs and cut them randomly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 8,000 gold by hunting the ‘Troll Warrior’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 8,000 gold by hunting the ‘Troll Warrior’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 8,000 gold by hunting the ‘Troll Warrior’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if to relieve the Crusaders’ concern, the Necromancer jumped into the heart of the enemy camp and destroyed the trolls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And quite a few were watching Sungwoo fighting brilliantly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can you see him over there? Isn’t he the Necromancer?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? You’re right! That dragon-like monster also appeared during the Youido raid. He’s really huge even when we look at him from a distance!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of players were chatting, gathered by the windows of a building with a nice view of Sunyu Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the fighting on the ground was spectacular. Even from a distance, they could see the ranks of giant trolls collapsing like dominoes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“When did the Necromancer come? Didn’t you say he was staying in Suwon until last night?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, that’s what I heard. Man, he suddenly appears and vanishes into thin air!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the Necromancer’s brilliant fighting was such a contrast with the Crusader Team members who were just watching him helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, is it really true that the Crusaders are just standing idle without fighting at all?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, where is the camera? Just take the photos of them quickly! This is going to cause a great stir if we put this on the community bulletin.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The photos of the Necromancer slaughtering the trolls on Sunyu Island and the Crusaders doing nothing while watching him blankly were taken in one frame. And this picture was enough to cause a conflict between their supporters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While the community was heating up from the supporters’ arguing, Sungwoo penetrated the center of Sunyu Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly, his army was being filled with a huge number of “troll skeletons.” In fact, he kept the skeletons and the ghouls in the Empty Haven and picked up the slack with the trolls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Synergy effect’ is given due to team play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Giant (Stage 3)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Attribute synergy<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: 20 or more with the attribute of a giant<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Reduces damage caused by small and medium opponents (-30%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The synergy of  generated by the addition of a large number of troll skeletons would be a great advantage for Sungwoo when he confronted the Orc Legion in the future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If they put on bone armor here, they won’t break.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was preparing for the battle of tomorrow by going through the battle now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I think that guy is the boss,” Minsok said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, the boss monster of the troll unit appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The warlord monster ‘Troll Chief’ has appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The boss monster, accompanied by a dozen bodyguards, walked out with a desperate expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unlike other trolls, he was quite a big guy, holding a large stone ax in his right hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Given that the stone was illuminating green, it didn’t seem like an ordinary weapon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, the boss monster swung the ax and struck down a troll skeleton. At that moment, a vine grew from the floor and tied his ankles immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quazzik! Quazzik! Quazzik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the monster began to wield their axes at the troll skeleton violently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The troll’s bones were smashed and piled up under his feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, the monster’s attack turned out to be futile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The smashed trolls started to reassemble by the power of Lich.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Show him what it means to be tied and beat him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo shouted, the Ogre Skeleton rushed to the boss monster. As his bodyguards were confronting Sungwoo’s troll skeletons, the boss monster had to confront the Ogre Skeleton one on one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Along with the huge sound of him trampling the ground, the 8-meter white giant Ogre Skeleton stretched out both hands. The troll chief counterattacked by swinging the stone ax.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Booooooooung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the troll chief’s attack was not as timely as he thought. Ogre Skeleton avoided his ax by lowering his head and grabbed him around his waist. Then, he lifted the troll chief up in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Perhaps it was the first time the troll chief found himself being lifted into the air like that because there were no trolls around him who could lift such a giant troll like him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The troll chief struggled to get out of Ogre Skeleton’s hold, but he couldn’t stop himself from falling vertically onto the concrete floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Kugugugugugugugugugu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>With cracks in the floor beginning to spread, the troll chief’s body became stiff for a while. A tremendous shock shook his central nervous system.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Ogre Skeleton punched his broad face ruthlessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ogre Skeleton kept punching him. Since the troll chief was never trained in counterattacking once he was laid under by somebody, he had no choice but to be beaten helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He lifted both arms to cover his face, but Ogre Skeleton began to strike his abdomen hard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you don’t know, you should get this punishment.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The bloody screaming of the troll chief resonated across Sunyu Island for some time. No matter how good the troll chief was at regenerating, he could not stand it when he was restrained and beaten.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, with his face and skull smashed to pieces, Minsok killed the troll chief with his sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Time remaining until you get the credentials: 3,853 days. </div><h2 id="chapter124">Chapter 124</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The Crusader Team members were guarding Yanghwa Bridge in preparation for the incoming attack by a large number of trolls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They thought that the only way for them to effectively stop those tremendous monsters was to deal with them on a narrow road, so they were determined to confront them to the end even at the risk of their lives.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, they’re coming!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But when they looked at the strangers, there were only two crossing Yanghwa Bridge. They were the Necromancer wearing a dark green robe and the Death Knight with glaring green eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon and the Crusaders greeted them at the end of the bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m glad you arrived not too late.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At this moment, Junghoon felt that he could not buy off this man who could smash a large army of monsters alone with only one million gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He thought to himself, ‘Man, I decided to strengthen myself while the Necromancer was defending Youngdungpo, but the Necromancer appeared as a much stronger being.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>But he tried to look as calm as possible and shook hands with Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is only the beginning of our fight. We’re going to see the Red Orcs attacking from the west quite soon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I know.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon didn’t want to be humiliated by Sungwoo in the next battle. Since the entire Korean server was watching him closely, he would lose his face completely if he fell behind Sungwoo once again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I am already far behind him. I’ve got to fight successfully in the next battle to prove my presence.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>With strong determination to beat Sungwoo, he was now burning with a desire to fight the Red Orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The brilliance fighting of the Necromancer was splashed across the entire Korean server through the community bulletin. The implications of his fantastic fighting brought about unusual consequences.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ‘Youido Raid’ led by Sungwoo that took place recently was close to an ‘event’ that the players from all over the country watched from afar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter what happened to the participants of the raid, there was no visible damage to those watching their activities through the live broadcast.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, we’re getting so many calls from here and there, telling us they want to join our alliance.”<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>[481] Necromancer is our only hope, no matter how hard we think about it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Author : Euntaek Kim │ Hits: 145,555<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>「Comments: 67」<br/><br/><br/><br/>[485] I also support the necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Author : Kim 344 │ Hit: 133,125<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>「Comments: 44」<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as such threads began to spread on the community bulletin, a group of survivors, who had been trying to find the way of survival independently, began to gather one by one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They wanted to participate in the alliance for the upcoming battle with the Red Orcs. In fact, they already knew they could not survive if they didn’t join now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And they witnessed so many events through the community bulletin, so they knew well what choices they had to make in a moment of crisis.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their conclusion was they needed to join hands with the Necromancer for survival.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That’s why they began to gather around the allied forces led by Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I hear that the survivor group in Ilsan are coming to join us. They have a force of around 200. They’re larger than we think, but strange enough, they have been keeping a low profile until now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Another survivor group in Namyangju also contacted us. They said they would take five buses to come here. Man, this is going to be a…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, the leadership of the Liberation Guild was confused. Obviously, they needed more troops for the battle with the Red Orcs. Besides, they could beef up their forces on the occasion of the upcoming fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the problem was that what the survivors regarded as their pivotal was not the Crusader Commander of the Liberation Guild, but the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What has the Commander told us to do?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusader Team member who brought the message asked Minhum.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, we have to accept them. We have to take them on our side. We can’t send them back now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The war was coming soon, but their troops were infinitely small, compared with the Red Orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re going to have a commanders’ meeting soon. So, if they arrive, arrange them into groups. Let me come back and confirm it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They could not figure out how many “Red Orc” troops appeared in Kimpo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to one article posted in the community bulletin, the number of Red Orcs was so large as to fill the vast Kimpo field. Obviously, they were a large force.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Such a tremendous Red Orc force was now advancing eastward towards them. The survivor group in Mokdong informed them through the community bulletin that they were raided several hours ago. It meant that they already arrived at the place not far from here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, the allies of the Liberation Guild secured an outpost at the intersection of the entrance to Kyongin Expressway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re going to start the frontline commanders meeting now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At 7 p.m., the commanders’ meeting was being held in the largest tent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have deployed surveillance troops on all the bridges, but since we don’t know when and where the enemies will cross the bridge, we’re going to launch a magic drone to monitor the enemy’s movement in 24 hours.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While Minhum was briefing them, the leaders of each group glanced at Sungwoo sitting at the end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although they knew the importance of a joint operation, they were conscious that the fate of the battle would be decided by the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum was bothered by the commanders’ attitude but continued to give the briefing. But he was stopped when one of the Crusader Team members came into the tent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander! Just a minute ago one survivor flew here from the west.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he delivered the urgent news, there was a moment of silence in the conference room.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon at the head table opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He flew here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, he flew. But what he got aboard was rather unusual.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unusual?<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the end, Junghoon stood up from his seat, then went out of the tent without saying anything. Then, other commanders stood up and followed him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A team of Crusaders surrounded something near the tent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, be careful! Don’t go close!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You’re going to be killed if you are pecked by that beak.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a huge monster, a flying creature with an eagle’s head and a lion’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His body seemed to be bigger than most bulls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Rest assured! He doesn’t bite you unless you attack him first. He is good.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a ‘Griffin’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good boy, good boy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A woman was gently stroking Griffin’s neck. The Crusader man who brought the news pointed at her and said, “Commander, I’m talking about that woman.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he said that, the woman hurriedly turned her head and looked at them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then she shouted, with a sad expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please help me!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What she said next was just unbelievable and quite unexpected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, a few hours ago a huge number of Chinese players landed in Kanghwa!!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everybody began to be agitated at her remarks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What did you say? Who is coming?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“China? She said the players were Chinese, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They came to our land from China? Why?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The woman was about to cry.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They came to our village and slaughtered the villagers! They came aboard dozens of fishing boats, and maybe they will come here soon through Han River!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, everyone instantly felt that this war would not be over even after they beat the Red Orcs. </div><h2 id="chapter125">Chapter 125</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Inside the Commander’s tent, the griffin rider, Heyon Lee from Kanghwa Island, testified about the situation she witnessed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“About one thousand players live on Kyodong Island right now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to her, the players of Kanghwa Island had a Safety Zone on the small island ‘Kyodong Island’ connected by land to the main Kanghwa Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the island was small, the players initially thought it was relatively easy to secure safety by blocking Kyodong Avenue which linked Kanghwa Island after slaughtering all the monsters on the island first. They were aware of the mighty inland forces, such as the Liberation Guild of Youngdungpo, who could help them in contingencies, but they chose to survive by themselves until the Chinese pirates arrived unexpectedly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Heyon said, “A few hours ago, the pirates landed on Kyodong Island. They were aboard dozens of fishing boats.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She said the pirates, who were believed to have come from China, landed on three coasts, including the “Kyodong Island Dock,” and took control of Gyodong-daero first to block islanders from retreating.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We resisted as much as we could because there were quite a few villagers on the island, but we couldn’t win. I escaped from them and came here to ask for your help.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Heyon was a “Griffin Rider.” She had the only job that could use the sky roads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How many pirates?” Junghoon asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Heyon shook her leg while sitting in a small plastic chair. She frowned as if she recalled what she had seen then opened her mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“About one thousand, I guess. Maybe more than that because I saw more people on the anchored fishing boats.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Deep sighs came out here and there when they heard that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Since China has such a large population, Chinese players are probably twice as many as ours here. Wouldn’t it be big trouble if they decided to attack us?” one of the commanders said. Then, others agreed with the commander.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As you know, there are guys who hunt players rather than monsters. I’m afraid these Chinese pirates are definitely such guys. I think they’re going to attack us to take our gold.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think so. We need to prepare for their attack.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s right.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Junghoon, looking down at the table, was just touching his chin with his hand. Minhum next to him spoke first, “You’re right, but it’s hard for us to deal with the Red Orcs. Since we are not sure about the purpose of the unidentified players who landed on Kyodong Island, it would be dangerous for us to act recklessly. For now, we should be careful.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Minhum emphasized prudence, the self-proclaimed “King Kwon,” Ansok Ku, said he was opposed to his prudence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But what if they attack us through the Han River? Isn’t that big trouble? Youngdungpo would be in danger, and we would be ambushed even before we get to counterattack.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ansok spoke as gently as possible, but given his violent temperament, it looked like he would hurl abuses anytime.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Junghoon raised his head and said, “You guys have to confront the Red Orcs right now. You can’t avoid them under any circumstances. As long as the Red Orcs are in control of Kimpo and the Kangso District, those pirates will not be able to move inland toward us. We should be concerned about their possible infiltration into the rear through the Han River, but we can dispatch troops down the Han River to monitor them. We can’t go to Kanghwa Island right now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah…” Heyon let out a deep sigh at that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although she came here for help, she found out they could not afford to help her and the people on Kanghwa Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What about my idea?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was Sungwoo who opened his mouth then. All eyes turned to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We can dispatch a commando unit to crack down on the pirates, and then attack the front and rear of the Red Orcs at the same time. In other words, we’re carrying out a feint operation.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Ansok frowned at his remarks, with his arms folded, and said, “I agree with you about attacking them, but our Commander just said we could not afford to create a commando unit, right? Besides, the only way we can infiltrate there is to use a helicopter, but if a helicopter flies over that small island, we can’t mount a surprise attack…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ansok suddenly stopped opposing his idea as if he hit upon something, then looked at him with a surprised expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can you do it?” Junghoon asked. He understood what Sungwoo meant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The commando unit that Sungwoo mentioned was not a small unit of elite members. It referred to only one person, namely Sungwoo himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Anyway, it’s difficult for me to fight with you on the same battlefield because the skills I use can harm you. Since I have to separate the battlefields anyway, let me go to Kyodong Island to take care of things there, then I’m going to attack them from the rear.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The battlefield where Sungwoo was fighting was very tough and dangerous. He often spread the Curse of Death or the Breath of Abyss. He also triggered Corpse Explosions from time to time. Because of his activities, it was not easy for him to move with other players as a team.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, it was not for that reason that he wanted to go to Kyodong Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Chinese players? I don’t know why they suddenly appeared, but they are probably a large force, and I think I can get some important information and items from them.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Until now, Sungwoo was completely separated from other servers, so he could only find out what was going on within the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Therefore, if he contacted the players from other regions and met them, he could expect to have an unexpected opportunity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘After I get tips from them, let me go into the rear and take over the essence of the Red Orcs.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>In addition, as the operation against the Goblin Lord by infiltrating the rear was effective, he was thinking of using a similar strategy this time. For that reason, he needed to go further west than Kimpo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I don’t even have to get on a helicopter. I can ride with Heyon and infiltrate as quietly as possible,” he said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he looked at Heyon, as if he was asking for her permission.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She said, “Sure, of course!” She nodded at him gladly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He then turned his head to Junghoon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon also nodded because he knew Sungwoo’s operation seemed the most effective.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Great!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stood up and said, “Then, let me go there and meet them in my capacity as the representative of our groups.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Heyon said that before flying she had to feed her griffin and go through a safety check.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, Sungwoo visited Jisu and Hanho and explained why he had to go to Kyodong Island now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, are you leaving us behind again?” Hanho asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Take care…” Jisu said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time, he could not take Jisu with him because it was impossible for three people to ride Griffin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“When we meet next time, we will see each other probably in the middle of the battlefield, so take care of yourself until then. Hanho, got it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why should I?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“When you caught a goblin at the art museum, I saw you were dancing because you were so excited. Don’t get hurt while you are carried away with useless heroism.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m far from it, man! You are so mean…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A little later Heyon came back to tell Sungwoo that she was ready for the flight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo put all his luggage in the skeleton’s bag, except for the repeating crossbow, and put it into the Empty Haven. He reduced his flying weight as much as possible before the flight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he got to the end of the road, the griffin l prepared to fly. Heyon was tightening all kinds of strings on the griffin’s back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, you are here! You can get in the back seat here and connect the harness hooks.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She explained about the safety devices for flight. Although she expressed gratitude for the Necromancer who offered to help in person, she looked quite impatient, which was quite natural, given the urgent situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, her family and relatives were held hostage by the pirates on Kyodong Island. It would have been quite difficult for a 19-year-old girl like her to confront them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you’re done, can I start now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Heyon put her hand on the griffin’s head, he lowered his body, so that Sungwoo could climb.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stepped on the saddle and climbed onto the back seat. Like she explained, he tied his body to the saddle and fixed it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I should have told you before flying. I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you in advance,” she said, getting on the front seat. </div><h2 id="chapter126">Chapter 126</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“They are growing very large monster birds. These birds monitor us while flying in the sky, so if they are flying in the sky, we have to wait until dark on the nearby shore.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could not figure out exactly what the Chinese pirates were doing, but it was obvious that the Chinese pirates had someone with a job that could raise flying animals.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded without saying anything.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go, Gust!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Beep!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The griffin, Gust, spread its wings, roaring. He ran down the road, rolling his feet, flapping his wings, and starting to push the ground. In no time, his heavy body carrying the two soared into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whoowooooooong-<br/><br/><br/><br/>His altitude rose in an instant. Suddenly, the 8-lane Kyongin Expressway on the ground looked so small.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And far away in the downtown of the Kangso District, Sungwoo noticed countless Red Orcs wriggling, entangled with each other.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There are so many orcs out there!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>An enormous army of orcs was gathering near Anyangchon. Passing over the army of orcs, Gust flew further west.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>A gray container box was placed in a corner on the northern shore near the Kyodong Island dock.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Done!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jeeeeeeeng―<br/><br/><br/><br/>The lantern on the door flickered and the light came on immediately. The light pushed out the gloomy darkness around it, creating a pale shadow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Four people sitting on the table in front of the container box turned their heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, are you done installing the batteries now? It’s a gloomy orange light. It looks like a very old lantern.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But it’s moody here, isn’t it? Man, we have to hug a woman in this mood. Damn it! Why should our leader have us not touch the prisoners here? I hear that our players in Taiwan are enjoying themselves freely now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You know what? There are quite a few prisoners there that even low-level guys can play with. Hey, if we go to the mainland of Korea, we’ll also have a good chance. We can earn lots of gold and take a couple of Korean women in our arms. Don’t you think Korean girls are better than Taiwanese girls?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chatting and laughing like that, they filled their cups with alcohol, but an unknown, large centipede was inside a transparent glass bottle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! It was a really clever idea to make strong alcohol with a ‘monster centipede’ egg we caught from Hangzhou. Wow, just great!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Still, our captain may fly the monster bird in the sky to monitor us, so look closely at the sky. If we are caught, we may have to donate the other two bottles to that drunkard.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahaha!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players from China completely occupied the area around the dock on Kyodong Island. They were now dispatched all over the island to monitor the coast. There were some like these players who were idling their time away instead of doing their jobs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, don’t you think we are better off after we were kicked out of the mainland? It’s much more fun for us to beat the local players here like this than fighting those monsters on the mainland. Don’t you think so?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bet. Besides, we are gaining lots of gold. I think our leader…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the man wearing a ponytail raised his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wait a moment! Shush!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a moment of silence. He put down the glass with a frown. Then, he put his right hand on the dagger on his waist and stared at something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, there seems to be something out there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you hearing anything? Where is it coming from? I can’t see anything.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Other players found nothing. But they trusted the senses of this guy with the ponytail.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His job, “hunter,” gave him senses that far surpassed those of an ordinary man.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While there was an eerie silence, only the sound of bugs chirping was heard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man wriggled his eyebrows and glared somewhere in the dark.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the four others here could not see anything in front of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, three heads fell onto the table, along with the sound of the wind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A green demon with a huge scythe stood tall in the space where there was nothing before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Among the colleagues whose heads were cut off, only the man who was sitting at the far end of the table was spared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Aaaaaaah!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a scream, the man stepped back, startled, and the moment he rolled away from the table, somebody threw a black chain and wrapped it around his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The chain pulled tight and dragged him into the dirt.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shush! Be quiet. Can you understand me?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the man looked up, a skeleton knight with hollow green eyes stretched out his hand toward his neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, yes! Of course!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The system equipped with translation function made it possible for them to communicate beyond language.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Follow me quietly. If you don’t, I will put your head in that liquor barrel.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even the skeleton knight’s terrible threat was contained in the translated voice of the system. Now, the Chinese player had nothing to do except nod at the skeleton knight’s order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, he left the corpses of his colleagues behind, then he was dragged somewhere with his hands tied and mouth covered. The place he arrived was inside an old warehouse on Mt. Hwagae. Inside it was a creature that was terrible enough to be compared to two green skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a griffin, a beast with a lion body and the head of an eagle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the beast saw the man, he made a rough breath, bumped his beak on the ground, then got ready to rush at him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, a young woman sitting next to him began to soothe the griffin and said, “Alright, calm down. Let me give him to you later.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Me… later?” The man, with his face turning white, looked at the two men who brought him there. The devil-looking man who was wearing a dark green robe had changed into an ordinary man.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He pulled an iron chair and sat in front of the Chinese player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You know what I’m trying to do from now on. Don’t be stubborn. I have the skill to read some of the memories of the dead. Either talk in detail when you are alive or tell me roughly after you are killed. Choose one of the two options.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man just swallowed at Sungwoo’s threat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay, did you choose which option you want to take?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the man did not know because he would face the same fate regardless of which option he took.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>At 3 AM, the whole Kyodong Island was noisy because the patrol guard reported that a large number of the players had gone missing overnight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Does it make any sense that 90 people disappeared overnight? Check if any of the prisoners we detained here escaped! Get on the boat right away and search the coast if there are any shops outside!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After giving them the order hysterically, the captain went out onto the dock and held out his right hand to the sky. Then, a magic circle in the shape of a cage floated in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Black birds with a wingspan of five meters suddenly popped up from somewhere. There were a total of ten birds, but they disappeared into the night sky with their four red eyes sparkling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know who the hell they are, but don’t ever think you can find a place to hide on this island!” The captain muttered, gnashing his teeth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He thought there was no place to escape on this small island, and they could not hide as long as he controlled the island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, somebody came running, gasping for breath.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Captain! We have found the missing men!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? Where are they?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He lifted his finger and pointed at the fishing boats anchored in the dock.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lantern lights were flickering dozens of fishing boats. People were yelling here and there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“All of them were found dead, but they were piled up in the ship.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Bodies inside the ship? What kind of pervert is this bastard?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gnashing his teeth, the captain walked to the dock. After assassinating the guards and putting their bodies inside the ship instead of throwing them in the sea? He could not understand the attacker’s behavior.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment he arrived near the dock, his eyes turned orange in the light.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were big explosions that could shake the whole island, then the fishing boats on the left began to explode one by one. The shock coming from below the deck spread everywhere, scattering the wood debris in all directions. Subsequently, the flames began to eat away the remaining parts of the broken ships.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kugugugugugugu….<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every ship was smashed by the explosions and flames. Watching the explosions, the captain wondered if he was dreaming.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this? What happened?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…” </div><h2 id="chapter127">Chapter 127</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Hey! Didn’t you hear me asking? What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The captain shouted with veins bursting in his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“All the boats were smashed with explosions!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I know that! Why are they exploding?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know yet…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The disaster they could not understand was not over yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pusheeeeeeee―<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh! Ahhhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Keeeeeeeek! Keeeeeeek!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those who were guarding the building with the waiting room came out in droves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They threw down their weapons, coughed, and began to fall, foaming at the mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Black smoke rose from the waiting room window behind them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Captain! Gas is spreading! There was something like a strange thermos…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You must avoid it! That’s the Breath of Abyss used by the black wizard. If you inhale it, you will be incapacitated!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Furthermore, there was the sound of bizarre cries from all around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is this sound?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A series of bizarre things began to take place on the remote island at dawn. The screams of the captain’s subordinates dispatched all over the island to search for intruders rang out from everywhere. It was something serious.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The captain looked up at the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monster birds he was raising were crying. They were scanning the whole island to check the movement of the enemy, so their signals meant that there were enemies all over the island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This is a massive raid. They are trying to trap and annihilate us.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The captain was sure it was a massive raid by enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Bridge! Secure the bridge now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since all the fishing boats had exploded already, Kyodong Bridge was the only way for them to escape. The captain thought there was a huge army of enemies, and he knew his players would be isolated on the island with no way out because the enemies used biochemical weapons such as gas.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘As things stand now, we might be stranded here even before our reinforcements come from Taiwan. I need to take my men to a wider area, so our main force can land safely.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The captain couldn’t even confirm the numbers of the enemy. Besides, when he witnessed bizarre things happening in succession, he naturally thought of the worst scenario first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He breathlessly raced to get on the truck he prepared in advance. Dozens of vehicles were lined up. They turned on the engines all at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wooooooong! Wooooooong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They drove fast toward Kyodong Bridge without looking back. When they drove along the winding coastal road, they saw something white over the dark sea. It was a concrete bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Floor it! We have to escape to a bigger island by all means!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since there was little traffic between the islands, it was devoid of abandoned cars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed like they could go to Kanghwa Island in no time if they were not stopped.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a huge monster appeared on the bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh! What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The giant, white monster, Bone Drake, was standing in the middle of the bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the monster’s head stood a demon covered in green flames holding a huge scythe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God! What the hell is going on in this land?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were the real identity of the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>A few hours ago, Sungwoo obtained all kinds of information from the kidnapped sailor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Where are you from?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, we are from the second server in China.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The pirates came from China’s eastern coastal cities such as Shanghai and Hangzhou. They were China-2 server’s players. Since China was a vast land, there were three servers, according to the sailor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is there any restriction when you switch to another server?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, there is no such thing. In China, there has been widespread contact since the restrictions on regional movement were lifted.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the Korean Peninsula had sea on three sides, there was no opportunity for its players to contact other servers, but they could contact other servers in China.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that even if a player moved to another server, there were no other restrictions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why did you come to Korea?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, we were pushed aside in the battle for supremacy within the second server. That’s why we were almost driven out of China and forced to storm the areas close to China such as Taiwan and South Korea.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were similar to the Germanic tribes who were pushed out by the Huns invading the Roman empire. However, the Korean server wasn’t easy prey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right now, they would witness it directly on Kyodong Bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Screeeeeeeech!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of vehicles suddenly stopped right before Bone Drake who blocked the bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their headlights were beaming randomly from side to side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Yeah, these guys escaped in a hurry.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo already knew that the pirates would try to escape from the island immediately after they had been ambushed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Chinese pirates planned to use Kyodong Island as an outpost for the conquest of the Korean peninsula, so they planned to build watchtowers along the coast for fortification.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, they were no more than an advance party for the landing of their main force.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Because of that, they were planning to remain in Korea at the risk of their lives to help their main forces land safely, and they even made an “emergency escape manual.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The guy said that after they escaped through Kanghwa Island, they planned to move inland to lay the groundwork for more pirates to land.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could not allow them to do so, of course.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The captain shouted, “Now, everyone get off the trucks! Ready for battle!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get ready for battle!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His voice was urgent. It was Korean in Sungwoo’s ears, but the tone of his voice was a mess. It seemed that the tone peculiar to the Chinese language was not corrected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The captain shouted again, “Hide behind the car and prepare magic!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Archers, load fiery arrows!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They hid behind the vehicles and watched Bone Drake carefully. However, it seemed that they didn’t dare strike first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had the undead scattered all over the island on standby in the Empty Haven. Then, he summoned all of them to the bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in the affected area!<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Death Response’ begins in the affected area!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Along with unidentified messages, black smoke rose and engulfed the whole bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pusheeeeeee―<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh! What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, my whole body is aching!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Stick with it! You can stand it without any problem! If you guys run around in confusion, they are going to attack us right away! Stay calm and watch out!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The pirates suffered damage while breathing in the black smoke, but they endured it in the back of the trucks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Certainly, they thought the smoke wasn’t fatal enough to kill them at once. They just thought it was kind of a skill that would shake their camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But they were mistaken because they never imagined that the undead would pop out from the black smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh! Be careful! They are attacking us from behind!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kueeeeeeek!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Zombies in bone armor jumped out of the dark, stabbing their spears into the backs of the pirates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They couldn’t respond because they were on alert for only Bone Drake in front.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Where did they come from?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everyone, stand up and fight! Fire behind you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! They’re coming on your side, too!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time, they were ghouls. Violet-skinned monsters moved on the railings of the bridge then jumped onto the pirates’ sides.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ghouls’ sharp nails cut through the pirates’ necks. With acrobatic movements, they freely crossed between the cars, railings, pylons, and cables to attack the pirates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Aghh! Help me!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The pirates, who were focused on the surprise attacks from behind, fell helplessly when the ghouls attacked randomly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! They are also attacking from above!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Watch out everywhere!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Monsters poured out from the surrounding dark where car headlights of the trucks on the narrow road were the only lights. They could not respond.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The captain looked at the corpses of his men piling up around him and turned his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His eyes again turned to Kyodong Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Secure our retreat right now! It’s better for us to go back to Kyodong Island if we are surrounded here on the bridge.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s too late. All roads are already blocked!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The entrance to Kyodong Island was blocked by other large skeletons: Ogre Skeleton and Troll Chief Skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were four troll skeletons standing tall on both sides of the two monsters, so they quickly gave up breaking through them to escape.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- Thump- Thump- Thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monstrous giants grabbed their bone hammers and began to close in on them. When the monsters over 4 meters tall charged at them, they lost the will to fight and collapsed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhh! We are done!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We can’t beat them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was nowhere for them to escape. They hid behind the trucks, shuddering with fear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the troll skeletons turned the trucks over. Then, they lifted their hammers against the pirates hiding there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bloody screams were heard everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a sharp scream began to come from the sky above Kyodong Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, a flock of giant black birds flew in. </div><h2 id="chapter128">Chapter 128</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Uh, they are monster birds! Monster birds!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please kill all the monsters!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo suddenly recalled what Heyon told him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Are they the monster birds that she mentioned?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>She said that the pirate’s boss controlled black birds called ‘Monster Bird’. Sungwoo infiltrated the island in the dark not to be noticed by those monster birds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monster birds’ red eyes flashed in the night sky. They dove, aiming at the zombies with claws looking like hooks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of them snatched a zombie in bone armor as if he was a child and threw it off the bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Splash! Splash!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ten zombies disappeared in a blink of an eye.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Hum… they are not as terrible as I thought.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was not surprised when he watched them killing the zombies. In his eyes, the undead that the monster birds could deal with were only zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeh! Kueeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, they showed their claws to the ghouls that were much faster and heavier than zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, they were dragged to the ground by the ghouls. Ghouls had a stronger grip than expected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monster birds fluttered to escape but were torn to pieces by the ghouls’ claws and teeth. Black feathers were scattered all over the bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Use the slingshots!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each of the troll skeletons was carrying long-range weapons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They pulled stones almost the size of an adult fist from the leather pouches on their waists and hung them on slingshots that looked like catapults.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The stones, which were shot with tremendous speed, flew toward the monster birds’ wide wings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just one stroke was enough. One monster bird, directly hit by a stone, circled in the air and crashed into the bridge. They had excellent mobility, but their durability was not good.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no! Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The captain screamed, watching the monster birds falling one by one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He realized that he could not turn to the monster birds as his last resort.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, more terrible things happened. The monster birds that were killed began to wriggle, raise themselves, and spread their wings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– The dead now become your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead now become your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The sparkling red eyes of the monster birds turned green.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the moment when the monsters who previously followed the captain’s orders faithfully became zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo took a dead person as his subordinate spirit, they generally became a skeleton, but in the case of birds, it seemed that Sungwoo had them keep their original shape because without wings they could not fly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God! What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The captain stepped back, mumbling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey! No, I have to get out of here. If I contact our main forces, these bastards…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he climbed over the railing and threw himself off the bridge. His body fell toward the night sea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the monster birds flew and grabbed him by his shoulder and started to fly towards Kanghwa Island. He left his men behind to escape alone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But he couldn’t fly that far. Greater wings than the monster bird’s appeared right above it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You can’t escape!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was Heyon and Gust. When she put her hand on the back of Gust’s neck and whispered something, Gust spread his huge claws. Then, he rushed to the monster bird’s back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh! Get out of here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The captain yelled, but to no avail. Gust’s claw gripped the bird’s wings like a hydraulic press. The bird’s wing bones were smashed, then Gust threw it toward the top of the bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The bodies of the monster bird and the captain were separated in the air. The captain struck the reinforced structure above the pylon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>His skull caved in the impact and his spinal column was broken. Then, he fell on the asphalt in the middle of the bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since his bones were crushed, he couldn’t move. His head was torn and bleeding.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was now forced to stare forward, twitching his eyelids, the only thing he could move. Soon, he saw something like a foot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something huge landed behind him. It was Gust who had thrown the captain in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Necromancer! I freed all the villagers! They are taking back the weapons and fighting back against the pirates.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good job!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thanks a million. All thanks to you, Necromancer! Thank you so much! Thank you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like she said, the villagers on Kyodong Island took back the island in one day after it was occupied by the pirates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Who the hell is this Korean?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The captain wanted to ask him who he was, but he couldn’t open his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I heard that you guys made lots of gold through pirate synergy. If that’s true, I’m afraid I can’t take your gold.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man called the Necromancer said as if he knew something. He pushed the crossbow at the captain’s face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did you say your leader was General Chongong? Will he appear in your memory?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was clear that the Necromancer knew something. Perhaps during the night, he tortured several of his men. Moving secretly, he killed the security guards and exploded the fishing boats anchored on the dock.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nearly 800 men under the captain were killed overnight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it… who the hell are you…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The captain finally uttered something feebly, but they were his last words.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>An arrow was stuck in his right eye.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 17)<br/><br/><br/><br/>And soon he was resurrected and stood up as a skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You can check the ‘fragments of memory’ of the dead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The video started playing in front of Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was inside a big boat. A man was sitting on a red sofa. He wore a red silk robe embroidered with gold stripes. The robe looked like traditional Chinese clothing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He said, “Where should we go?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>None of those standing around him replied. The boat shook once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our 2nd Server gave way to that ‘Spirit’ bitch. And that self-styled ‘Emperor’ of the 2nd Server is advocating for the unification of the world by increasing his power every day. Our 3rd Server also surrendered to that guy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s right.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, what should we do? Is it our destiny for us to wander around the vast Yellow Sea?” The man said desperately, but his expression was calm.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed he had a plan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How about targeting Taiwan?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Taiwan?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Taiwan is certainly our Chinese territory, so I don’t understand why our servers are split. With our own force now, we can easily subdue Taiwan. We can prepare again there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man gently smiled and said, interlocking his fingers, “Taiwan? However, we can’t get a lot by taking a small land like Taiwan. The monster race has its own territory, so we need to have a large piece of land to catch more monsters, so we can grow richer faster.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, how about Korea? After occupying Taiwan, we can wait for the time to acquire Korea and advance to the mainland through Manchuria.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man in the red clothes nodded with a pleasant smile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Actually, that was what I was thinking.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He stood up from his seat, then said in a somewhat anachronistic tone, “General Jikong, check the landing site on the coast of Taiwan and build an outpost. We have some information about the forces in Taiwan. Since we are now wandering the sea, we can’t guarantee our future. Since you carry out your mission successfully on the first try, you should never let your guard down.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes! General!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He turned his head and looked at the captain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“General Ingong, lead a small fleet to the Korean peninsula, prepare and preserve an outpost for landing for our men until they occupy Taiwan. Refrain from instigating the forces of the Korean peninsula, and prepare for my arrival.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, General!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He sat back and interlocked his fingers again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everyone, make the most of pirate synergy. For the sake of the great cause, I hope that you can put aside any sense of guilt and rake in as much gold as possible.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As far as Sungwoo knew, “Pirate Synergy” was reserved for those players involved in killing and plundering. When they killed players, the gold they earned was doubled. Besides, they could earn up to 20 percent of the players’ gold automatically.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That’s why they slaughtered the inhabitants of the occupied land without hesitation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Finally, don’t forget our quest. A prince will be born at the end of this confusion…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everyone bowed their heads and cheered for the general. That man was their boss, “General Chongong.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The video ended there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘As expected, I can’t believe those who talk about a great cause.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Such characteristics were not limited to the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Next, Sungwoo selected the skill item from the level-up cards appearing before his eyes after killing the captain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have acquired the skill .<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Skill grade has been upgraded. (Skilled → Professional)<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Death Response<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Professional<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Cost: 110 Mana<br/><br/><br/><br/>*You can summon and control 25 ownerless zombies in the abyss. They are not limited by the number of your subordinate spirits, and they disappear to dust after 30 minutes. (Wait time for reuse: 30 minutes)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like last time, Sungwoo’s skills were strengthened because he earned the skill Death Response. This time, he gained as many as ten, which was a great reinforcement ahead of a big battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Heyon approached and said, “Necromancer? What are you going to do now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked toward Kyodong Island. Smoke was rising all over the island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo infiltrated the pirates’ dens and killed most of them, including their key members on the bridge. Since their key members were killed, the residents of the island could easily get rid of the remnants.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, let’s go to Kimpo for the real war.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He turned his head and looked toward Kanghwa Island. Bone Drake was standing tall on Kyodong Bridge. And on his back the newly acquired undead, ‘zombie monsters’ lined up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can use them in the war.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He hit upon a strategy that could be a game-changer. </div><h2 id="chapter129">Chapter 129</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>After occupying the Kimpo area and moving into the Kangso District, the Red Orcs attacked a group of survivors near Dungchon Station before gathering near the Han River finally. They were now crossing Olympic Highway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God! They are flooding in!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A total of 5 magic drones were checking the situation in and around Anyangchon and conveying it to Junghoon and his allies. The commanders shuddered, watching the scary scenes projected on the white screen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“These monsters are three times as strong as ordinary orcs. They are huge…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>These red-skinned monsters over 2 meters tall were advancing, holding barbaric flags.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their flags shook with several severed human heads hanging on them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The victims were obviously those who were trying to survive in the Safety Zone of Mokdong.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although Junghoon didn’t see these monsters attacking them, he could easily guess they were killed terribly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, these monsters are only the advance party, not their main forces?” Minhum said, standing up with others watching them in a heavy atmosphere. Shortly afterwards, a map appeared on the screen. Minhum marked the Orcs’ marching route with a laser point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He said, “Now, given the direction of their advance, it seems that they will try to cross into Anyangchon through Yomchang Bridge. It is the street where they can move into Youngdungpo Station by the shortest route.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a bridge between Anyangchon and the Han River, far north of the Kyongin Highway Intersection where the allies were located.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We should stop them from passing this area by all means.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, Junghoon stood up. Then, he lifted the sword he had hung on his chair. “To do so, we have to start right now. Use the prepared means of transportation to go to your designated location. Then, fight the monsters according to our operation.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The war with the fate of the Korean peninsula at stake had begun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Near Yomchang intersection of Olympic Highway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump! Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Vehicles abandoned on Olympic Highway were being thrown off the road. Slave trolls with furrows on their necks picked up the cars and threw them off the road to clear the way for the large army of Red Orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Doudoudoudouuuuuuuu-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The sound of drumming filled the whole riverside. The Red Orcs marched without an organized formation. Like outlaws, their fighting style was simple: they stormed into the enemy area and crushed them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sometimes, they attacked tactically, but they didn’t feel the need for it right now because the humans, the natives living in this area, were weak.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But their advance was blocked, to their surprise. When the advance party stopped, the drumming stopped. An orc walked forward.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orc revealed his teeth when he witnessed what happened. The slave trolls who were clearing the road collapsed after having been burnt to a crisp. They were clearly ambushed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Red Orcs didn’t panic. They were on the march for war, and they enjoyed fighting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Holding axes, they were on alert, watching the surroundings carefully.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr…<br/><br/><br/><br/>There weren’t many places for the enemies to hide. At best, they could hide in the windbreak forest or an apartment complex along Olympic Highway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Attack them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Attack them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, human voices were heard here and there. At the same time, numerous arrows were shot from all over the apartment complex. The orcs did not panic, then they dispersed in all directions. Most of them started running towards the apartments. Since the enemies appeared, the orcs were ready to destroy them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, someone rose behind the bodies of the trolls. He was Kangyun Lee, a wizard of the flame series, who adorned his whole body with luxury items.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Dirty orc bastards!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kangyun raised his wand and shouted the spell. Then, fire soared from the windbreak that was blocking the apartment complex.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A huge flame spread along the windbreak forest, as if sparks fell on oil sprayed there beforehand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orcs who were trying to rush into the apartment complex stumbled, then retreated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, numerous arrows poured into their heads like a shower. Many of them were killed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, very good! Keep burning!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>During the Youido raid he could not play any meaningful role because of the wetland, but he had several skills specialized in AOE damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In particular, if there was such a densely clustered flock of orcs like this and a huge fire, he could freely cast the spell just like wildfires in the dry season.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Waves of Fire!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he shook his wand, the flames burning in the windbreak forest soared up to several meters. Then, they bent like a wave and soared towards Olympic Highway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were like a giant wave that swallowed the Red Orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orcs could not avoid the fire in a timely manner. Dozens of Red Orcs were struggling in the intense flames.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 1,200 gold by hunting ‘Red Orc Warrior’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 1,200 gold by hunting ‘Red Orc Warrior’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 1,200 gold by hunting ‘Red Orc Warrior’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 1,200 gold by hunting ‘Red Orc Warrior’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kangyun smiled in satisfaction at the series of messages.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uhhhhhh! It’s been awhile since I felt elated like this. Who else could do this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, it was still too early for him to be complacent yet. The Red Orcs were still up and coming, and they began to charge at Kanyun, the wizard who caused the flames.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shush!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! It was a close call!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>One arrow passed through his hat. Frightened, he hid behind the trolls’ bodies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, the sound of the drumming began to be heard again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dooung! Dooung! Dooung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Red Orcs began to attack again. When they could not move because of the windbreak forest engulfed in flames, they decided to start a frontal attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Block them! Protect the wizard!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, players ran out of the abandoned vehicles behind Kangyun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Most of them were tankers and holding shields. They formed something like a shield wall over the troll bodies. The shields were tightly attached shoulder to shoulder. They numbered two hundred.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are coming!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t move!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They then collided with the flock of orcs charging from the front in droves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The fighting between them began in the middle of Olympic Highway. The orcs were far superior in terms of their inborn build and strength. They were also numerically superior, but the players confronting them were those who had been trained by leveling up while going through a number of survival games.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hold out! If we can hold out here, we can inflict huge damages to the orcs!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blocking their advance with the flames and shields, they believed they were in a better position by firing arrows and casting magic from the apartment complex as long as they could hold out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Arh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have to hold out here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, simply building shield walls was not necessarily advantageous for them. The tall orcs could attack easily since they were taller than the shields. So, it was disadvantageous for them to confront the orcs face to face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We can’t stand still like this! Push them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Priests! Create shields in front!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players tried to overcome their disadvantages with their skills as much as they could.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of priests standing behind the shield walls generously triggered their healing skills and shield skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, the players lifted up the stronger shields and disrupted the orcs, then stabbed their stomachs with spears and swords.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When one player fell, dozens of Red Orcs fell at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While the bloody fighting was going on, arrows from the rooftop of the apartments were raining down on the orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fire the arrows! Keep firing them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t pay attention to the orcs coming through the flames! Defensive forces on the first floor will block them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyway, their ambush and isolation strategy paid off. Orc corpses were piled up all over the Olympic Highway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nevertheless, the orcs were huge in number. They rushed fiercely, passing over their fellow’s corpses. Among them were also non-combat series orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are orc shamans!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A large wooden shield came forward, and orcs with wooden canes appeared from behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were the monsters of the “shaman” series that used magic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Be prepared! Cast a magic protection spell on the shield!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s too late!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Black marbles flew in and stuck into the shields.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A tremendous shock swept the whole area when the marbles exploded. It was a spell powerful enough to push the shields and kill tankers instantly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuuh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was only when there weren’t any cracks that the shield walls could withstand the enemy attacks. In such a situation they could stop any number of enemies, but if some of them began to collapse, they would fall entirely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fragments of the shield and the players’ limbs were scattered everywhere. The left part of the shield wall was already paralyzed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Wake up! Orcs are racing toward us again!” </div><h2 id="chapter130">Chapter 130</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hundreds of orc warriors were rushing through the cracked shield walls. And even an orc cavalry riding on the “Dier Wolf” appeared among them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kangyun once again caused a wave of flames, but his spell became weaker, compared with earlier, for the flame itself faded after burning lots of the windbreak forest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, he could not stop the advance of the orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the players began to shout from behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Open the way!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everyone, get out of the way!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, with the sound of the metal clinking, a man in white full plate armor appeared among the cars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was Crusader Commander, Junghoon Choi.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crusaders Team, break through them now!” he shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Make a breakthrough formation!” Minhum repeated his order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At his order, the Crusaders in gray full plate armor lined up. They were now much larger than they were during the Youido raid, totalling 45 members.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those members at the forefront anchored the shields on the ground and defended against the orcs. Two layers of shield negated the orcs’ attack, which was much more sturdier than the shield walls of ordinary players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, not only the Red Orc warriors, but also the cavalry on Dire Wolves were stopped. Since they counterattacked the orcs successfully, it was time for them to retaliate. They aimed their huge crossbows at the orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the members in the rear row fired the crossbows all at once, the hordes of orcs running toward them like crazy collapsed like dominoes. It was tremendous. Even though ten crew members fired only once, they killed more than 30 orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Block the shamans!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Minhum shouted, those in the second row threw spears. But they were not real. The spears with the condensed energy of light flew and stuck in the wooden shield where the shamans were hiding.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The shield exploded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although there was no powerful shock, the orcs stumbled in sharp pain, and the magic that the orc shamans were preparing was canceled. It was a skill that served as a kind of flash bang.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Charge!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusader Team started moving forward. While maintaining a certain interval, they struck the orcs at the forefront hard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaaaaa!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The spears protruding through the shields pierced the necks and stomachs of the orc warriors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They fought back, wielding combat axes, but they bounced off the Crusaders’ golden shields.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusaders didn’t stop charging at the orcs. Maintaining a constant speed, they kept smashing the orcs and moved forward. Red-skinned bodies were piled up behind the road they passed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, that’s the best of the Crusaders’ fighting!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s the way they are waging the war!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players on the same battlefield were admiring their brilliant fighting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come on, guys. Don’t look at them blankly like that. Let’s go and support them! Hey, priests! What’s the point of saving your mana? Activate buffs!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although their activities were eclipsed by the Necromancer’s brilliant performance, the Crusaders team boasted the strongest fighting power on the Korean peninsula. In particular, they showed the best of their fighting skills in chaotic fighting like this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If we can fight like this, we can accomplish the exclusive quest.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon moved forward at the forefront, with his white armor stained with blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He raised his left hand and fired a ray of light, blasting the five orcs, then rushed and swung his huge sword at them Two orcs fell in one stroke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he fired his crossbows, a ray of light spread out, hitting four orcs at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Let me accomplish the exclusive quest, then move one step further. I’m getting close to the necromancer, too. Today is the day for me to awaken.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He felt that his awakening was not far away. The condition of awakening was training 30 Crusaders with level 10 or higher. His journey for awakening seemed that it would end on this battlefield finally.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hansung, step forward!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At his command, a crew member who was getting close to level 10, came running to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he stood next to Junghoon, and they swung their swords together. Junghoon left behind the neutralized orcs and kept moving while Hansung gained EXP by killing the orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A little later Hansung shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander! I’ve got to level 10…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good job.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have accomplished the exclusive quest  with ‘voice message.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Rewards are given. (1st Awakening, Exclusive Skill)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Your destiny changes subtly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And finally, the message that announced the completion of the quest appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wuuuuuuuuuu-<br/><br/><br/><br/>A golden aura emanated from Junghoon’s body. He slowly stretched out his left hand and lifted it up toward the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, that thing!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, a golden flag slowly descended from the air. It was a military flag called ‘War Standard’. Junghoon grabbed it. Even with little wind, the flag fluttered brilliantly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The whole army.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He raised the flag.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Charge!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He stuck the flag down on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘The area of a sacred war’ is declared in the affected area. (Lasts 1 hour)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All allies gain automatic-healing. (2% per second)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All stats of the ‘Crusaders’ will increase. (+5)<br/><br/><br/><br/>A golden wave spread over Olympic Highway. At the same time, the Crusaders rushed at full speed, screaming loudly. Knights supported by huge buffs broke through the center of the Red Orcs ruthlessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Smash them by gaining momentum!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hundreds of players followed the Crusaders. Half-dying orcs were left behind on the road that the Crusaders swept through. They were struggling like wasps struck with pesticides.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kill them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get rid of them without any exception!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players kept getting rid of the fallen orcs in high spirits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Move ahead!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Follow the commander!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusaders gained the upper hand after the golden flag fluttered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Orc warriors could not break through the Crusader Team’s shields. Because of that, they collapsed too easily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even without the Necromancer, they got rid of the orcs easily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon pulled his sword out of the Orc Chief’s neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s all over.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusader Team led by him annihilated one orc unit and even killed their commander.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum approached and said, “Commander, we’ve achieved a complete victory, except that about a hundred runaway orcs disappeared into the city.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What about the casualties on our side?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Three Crusaders were killed. Nearly a hundred players were killed, but casualties were far less than expected. Since they are all exhausted, they need to take a break before they run into other orc units.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon turned his head and looked around Olympic Highway. Gray smoke was rising from the windbreak forest, and countless corpses covered the road. The chaotic fighting was over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players, sitting on the unburnt empty land, were catching their breaths.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everyone was exhausted, including the Crusaders.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, vibrations kept ringing at a constant interval.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dooung-Dooung-Dooung-<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my God!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the sound of drumming again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this? Are orcs charging at us again?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Back to the battle right now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How many are they?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players couldn’t hide their astonishment, standing up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dooung-Dooung-Dooung-<br/><br/><br/><br/>A tremendous vibration was coming from the intersection of Kayang Bridge. At first glance, they seemed to be far larger than the previous orc unit they dealt with.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The scattered Crusader Team gathered around Junghoon. One of them, a member with a wizard’s profession, took a laptop out of his bag. It was connected to the magic drone, so the video of the orcs being filmed from the sky was being played.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A large army of orcs was approaching along Olympic Highway, not far from Junghoon’s place. And most of them were riding huge beasts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not only Dire Wolves, but four unknown monsters were moving forward at the forefront.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were black rhinoceros, who were larger than elephants.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It seems like they are the main forces of the Red Orcs. The orc unit that we dealt with was their advance party,” Minhum said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were far more overwhelming than expected. This was something Junghoon could not notice because the operating distance of the magic drone was short.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander, this battle is a bit dangerous. We’re all exhausted. Even if the Crusaders confront them, it’s impossible for them to stop such giant monsters.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think we have to go off the road and start a street fight. In my opinion, that’s the only way.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon said, frowning, “If we go into the street, can they follow us? I don’t think so. How about moving toward Youngdungpo Station through Olympic Highway?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum couldn’t easily answer his question.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our system cannot accurately predict our course.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, it is dangerous.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The orcs tended to head to the place where the players were gathered. And the place where most of them gathered was obviously Youngdungpo Station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was unclear whether the orcs would follow the allied forces to fight in the streets.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dooung-Dooung-Dooung-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The sound of the drumming got closer. The monster rhinos at the forefront began to trample the ground. With each heavy step, the asphalt shattered, and the huge vibrations reached the players’ feet. </div><h2 id="chapter131">Chapter 131</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Damn it! What the hell is that!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the hell! How can we stop them?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players were losing their minds at the terrific movement of the monsters. The horns on their heads were 1.5 meters long. If they confronted those giant monsters, all their bones and intestines would be smashed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- Thump- Thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monsters started running toward them now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, we’ve got to run now, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, we can’t stop them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment something fell on a monster’s head. At a glance, it was something like a corpse with limbs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>An explosion broke out right under the monster’s head. The monster staggered in the shock. Two riders on his back were thrown into the air, losing their balance and striking the guardrail before collapsing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, dozens of corpses were falling from the sky over the orcs’ cavalry.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With another corpse explosion, the orcs’ cavalry was in great confusion. When the beasts began to run wild at the unexpected shower of explosions, the orc commanders could not control them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The corpse explosions were like “carpet bombing,” a tactic that destroyed a large army with powerful firepower.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon raised his head and noticed Gust and unknown black birds flying in a row, holding corpses in their claws.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He could figure out what happened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, the Necromancer did it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The Necromancer is here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players’ voices were thrilled with admiration of the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Who would have imagined that the Necromancer decided to render firepower support instead of a feint operation?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, black smoke was spreading all over the junction of Kayang Bridge across Olympic Highway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the wind from the Han River pushed the smoke away, giant skeletons were standing in a row. Among them was Lich riding on top of Bone Drake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the best moment, the best reinforcements arrived.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ten “monster birds” and one griffin circled the sky before flying away. They dropped the orc corpses they had obtained from somewhere over the orc cavalry.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whenever they dropped the corpses, explosions occurred. The riders rolled down, and the beasts dispersed in all directions, stunned by the explosions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The undead giants charged towards them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- Thump- Thump- Thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of troll skeletons raced through the Olympic Highway, headed by Bone Drake, Ogre Skeleton, Ghoul King, and Troll Chief Skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a tremendous shaking on the road, resonating deeply throughout the whole city.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a giant rhino, whose appearance alone frightened the allied force, charged at them, but the Ogre Skeleton grabbed him by his horns and wrapped his arms around his neck before lifting and throwing him onto the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump―<br/><br/><br/><br/>The beast’s huge head was bent at a right angle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 20,000 gold by hunting the ‘Wasteland Rhino’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the huge beast named “The Wasteland Rhino” was resurrected as bones and charged toward the orc cavalry. The orcs had no way to stop that monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, can you see it? The Necromancer has appeared after having evolved further! This isn’t a joke!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And there were some who were broadcasting live such scenes with their own private broadcasting devices. They were independent players, who were filming the battle from the roof of a nearby building with the man with the cameraman’s job leading them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, look over there! The skeleton knight on top of Bone Drake is sweeping the battlefield like the hero of the old China’s Three Kingdoms!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You’re right! He’s like that legendary General Yopo! That’s the same skeleton that appeared during the fighting on Sunyu Island. He’s famous for the photo in which he was walking side by side with the Necromancer. Is he a player?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two cameramen were now commenting about the battle and the players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, he looks like the Necromancer’s man, but isn’t it rather unreasonable to call him a player? I haven’t even seen them speak.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But he was fighting brilliantly by using his own skills. My favorite skeleton was that little goblin, but I think I have to change my mind now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I like Bone Drake the best. Right now, Bone Drake is the most popular on the chat room. Yeah, I think I’m right.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Compared with the Liberation Guild’s official broadcasting of the Youido raid, there were not many viewers, but their numbers were constantly increasing after they heard the rumors that this fierce battle was being broadcast live.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right now the number of viewers reached 20,000.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Real time chat]<br/><br/><br/><br/>─ Sangtae Ahn: This time, the Crusaders fought brilliantly, but they were nothing compared with the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>─ Mr. Kim 23: Wow, I thought he would wrap it up when he stuck the flag a little while ago. He clearly proved it…<br/><br/><br/><br/>─ Hyosung Kang: Honestly, the Crusader Team was great this time, but the Necromancer is one cut above them. Man, that guy is really unpredictable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>─ Monkey Park: No matter how much you compare them, the Necromancer is the strongest player. Let me ask you this then. What the hell the guy ranked No. 1 is doing?<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was clear that the Crusaders made an outstanding performance in the first battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, people were supposed to remember only the top and the bottom.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Players on the Korean server ranked the Necromancer as the best, so there ensued inferences about the role of Gangsok Han, the unknown guy who was ranked No. 1. It was only after that that they mentioned the Crusader Team.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, most of them in the chat room feel that the Necromancer is the best. Nobody can deny that…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that time, the monitor screen began to shake violently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who, who are you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t come in! If you come in, I’ll shoot you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that there was an unexpected situation unfolding. The screen was still showing Olympic Highway, but there were exchanges of shouting and warning here and there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Put down your weapon! We are the Liberation Guild!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the intense scene was defused a lot when they heard it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Liberation Guild?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What brought you here now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, there was the sound of several people stepping in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please turn off the broadcasting right now! Or we will end it forcibly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Why are you doing this to us?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you are broadcasting this, you run the risk of exposing the strength of our allied forces! It’s dangerous, so turn it off right away! During the Youido raid, this kind of broadcasting was abused as information for terrorism!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like he said, at the time of the Youido raid, the Evolution Society members launched a terror attack against Youngdungpo Station while trying to seize the moment when the allied forces were most vulnerable because their information was exposed through such private broadcasting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, okay, step back first.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, they ended the broadcasting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, it was somewhat rather late when they stepped in. All the important scenes of the battle were already broadcast, including the dramatic appearance of the Necromancer that captivated the viewers the most.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Korean server players clearly recognized that the Necromancer would lead the war to victory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the first day, the allies who had won both battles returned to the outpost at the Kyongin Expressway Intersection.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo informed the allied leaders including Junghoon about what he had witnessed on Kyongdong Island. He could not keep to himself the fact that the Chinese forces were targeting the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m glad that you defeated their advance party, Sungwoo. Right now, we have to get rid of the Red Orcs first, then think about responding to the external forces behind them. I think we have to expand the role of our allied forces further after the war.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon explained the situation as calmly as possible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum added, “Armed conflicts with a large army of players will be different from fighting monsters. As you know, monsters have some standardized patterns of fighting, but the players don’t. They are humans like us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, they had experience confronting other players, namely humans, in the past.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But a large-scale war between two servers of different countries was fundamentally different in nature and scale.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If the entire server didn’t unite, they could be subjugated to other servers. The Korean peninsula had already experienced it during their long history, so they knew what that meant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you mean that we have to beat the players only after we get rid of the monsters? What should we hunt after that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ansok was now getting furious. Although he spoke emotionally all the time, all others agreed with him at this moment. What is the final purpose of this game that induces endless fighting?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Night fell. Sungwoo shared a small tent with Jisu and Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! This time we are fighting Chinese guys? I can’t believe this! In the south, the human beasts and crazy scientists are running wild, the orcs are going on a rampage in the west, and now Chinese guys are coming across the sea? Man, I really can’t believe this. How come all these monsters and players keep coming to this land?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho lamented as if he was sick and tired of the nasty development on Kyodong Island. </div><h2 id="chapter132">Chapter 132</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Although Hanho reacted emotionally, Jisu opened her mouth calmly while putting her two swords in order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We are strong on the Korean server, but I’m not sure how strong we are on the world stage. On the world map, Korea is a small country, so its server is also small. So, we have to…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She looked at Sungwoo, then said, “We have to hunt hard from now on.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was the right answer. Sungwoo needed to hunt more, which Sungwoo regarded as the goal after he left the campus, which was also the condition he put forward to her for her accompanying him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was true that Sungwoo’s group established an overwhelming position on the Korean server, but it was unclear whether they could stand tall on the world stage. In other words, the amount of gold and EXP circulating in the server was relatively small.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes. We have to take the upcoming battle not as a war but as hunting. By doing so, we will be able to get prepared for the next real war.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, we should try to hunt as many as possible in the fight tomorrow.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While listening to the conversation between Sungwoo and Jisu, Hanho looked dumbfounded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, what a relief you guys are going together like that! I feel like I’m useless. I just wonder what would happen to me if you didn’t take care of me. You are treating me well just because I’m good at controlling the community bulletin, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sunwoo ignored him and said to Jisu, “When this battle is over, let’s try to find a high-grade store and hope we can get some good luck.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>During that time, there was a lot of gold piled up. The gold possessed by Sungwoo was almost 6.1 million gold. He needed luck for this, but the moment this gold was turned into an item, he would become even stronger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Early in the morning, before dawn, there was some noise outside the tent, but it was not that of them preparing for the war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’ve been ambushed!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everybody, come out and block them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>An unexpected war began when they were not prepared at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are coming out of the ground!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu was the first to raise her body. She noticed some strange sensation even before the noise grew louder, so she was carrying her two swords.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m up already.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While approaching the entrance to the tent, she zipped up her training suit. The next moment, she twisted her body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whoooooooo- Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A battle ax missed her chin and smashed the paper box of food behind her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? What’s going on now?” Hanho, who woke up belatedly, shouted, with his eyes open wide.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu was already jumping out of the tent. Sungwoo put on his robe and picked up his repeating crossbow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, what the heck is going on?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Check it out at the community bulletin.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, are you mad at me because I complained to you yesterday?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo went out of the tent, the road was already a mess. More than half of the tents were torn apart, and the Red Orcs were attacking the players from all sides.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They came out of the ground,” Jisu said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were already a dozen orcs strewn around her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘From the ground?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked around and found cracks in the asphalt everywhere. There was a huge pit in the unpaved road.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What the heck is that?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>And something rose out of the pit. They were the roots of a tree about 4 meters in diameter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, the edges of the roots opened in four, and black smoke began to swirl in the center.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two Red Orcs appeared. They scattered in all directions as if on cue, then swung their axes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since they had been ambushed like this, it was only natural that the security guards were killed helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Yesterday, at the commander’s meeting, they concluded that it was rather easy to deal with the monsters because they had a standardized battle pattern, compared with the players, yet they had been ambushed by the monsters while undermining their strength.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Tankers, stick to your position!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why are you guys not out of the tents yet?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This kind of sudden battle was the worst possible development for them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the orcs were numerically superior, it was necessary for Sungwoo’s allies to firmly hold their position according to their job descriptions to come up with a normal response.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While the tankers were blocking the orcs, the archers and wizards were supposed to attack them, which was the standard way of attacking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, tankers had to wear heavy equipment, so it took a long time for them to prepare for battle. So, in an emergency situation like now, they had to jump out, holding their weapons only. It was impossible for them to hold their place while defending against the attacking orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Wizards, be careful!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Protect the wizards!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the tankers failed to carry out their mission properly, the archers and wizards in the rear could not help but be incapacitated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Smash the trees where they are coming out!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Somewhere, Junghoon’s voice was heard. And a golden light burst out from there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A flag fluttered brilliantly in the center.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘The area of ​​a sacred war’ is declared in the affected area. (Lasts 1 hour)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All the allies gain automatic healing. (2% per second)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All stats of the Crusaders will increase. (+5)<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was Junghoon’s skills of awakening. A huge golden wave swept the entire battlefield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, intense energy began to flow through the players’ bodies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good! I can hold out here!!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let them all come!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The situation changed a little. Although the tankers were not powerful enough to defend the orcs because they didn’t wear armor, they could hold out in their position thanks to the effect of automatic healing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As long as they could block the orcs for just one minute or even ten seconds, those in the rear could prepare for the attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wizards fired attack magic at once. All kinds of magic exploded in the center of the Red Orc group. They collapsed in a row. Knights popped out of the smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The Crusader Team, charge at the target! Offer cover fire!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their counterattack began. Armed with full plate armor, the Crusader Team, radiating intense light from all over their body, started an unstoppable advance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Charge!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’ll chase them to the end!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Arrows and magic shook the orcs in front. the Crusaders broke into them. Pushing the orcs hard with their thick shields, the Crusaders trampled the orcs coming out of the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Attack them all at once!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, they reached near the roots of the tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon, who was standing at the forefront, lifted his sword and swung it toward the top of the roots.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Half of the roots were cut, and the swirling black smoke scattered in all directions. He succeeded in destroying the unknown portal pouring out the orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I destroyed it! Charge to another place!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Different place! Where is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusaders looked around but didn’t see any more portals.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the Necromancer’s Ogre Skeleton was holding the ripped roots in both hands, and Bone Drake was chewing the roots he had pulled from the ground as if they were mountain herbs. And there were some burned root fragments around them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you done?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did the Necromancer smash everything when we only smashed one? Oh, my God!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They let out a sigh of relief, but at the same time they felt empty. As soon as they opened their eyes, they were involved in intense fighting, but the fighting ended quickly, to their surprise.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Anyway, what a relief!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Right.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were ambushed, but they could block the orcs with relatively little damages.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, look at this.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head at Jisu’s words. A black stone fragment was noticed through the root fragments scattered on the ground. The object was emitting pale black smoke, as if it had been heated up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Did this create the portal?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Junghoon and Minhum approached.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This looks like black magic. The orcs can do this kind of cunning trick?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muttering like that, Minhum picked up the black piece of stone. He frowned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! It contains a dark energy. If you touch it long, you will be negatively affected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, this is what I guessed.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a message appeared before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Orc Lord’ is casting massive black magic. If you don’t block them within the time limit, all the orcs will be reinforced as the ‘demons’. (Time remaining: 29:59:59)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The system is playing with us again!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo thought differently because he recalled an old memory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Black wizard Orc? I think this is a guy who can hit it off with me well.’ </div><h2 id="chapter133">Chapter 133</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Damn it! Why did they suddenly appear at this time?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum swore like a trooper. He then stuck his head out of the window slightly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusaders were closely watching the sky, almost crawling through the alleys back and forth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander, it seems like they disappeared near here, but we need to wait for safety’s sake a little longer. I think we shouldn’t rule out the possibility that the monster might be able to detect us from a distance and come back because we are camped here on a large scale.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, you’re right. We have no other choice. Let’s wait a little more.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The allied forces advancing toward Kimpo through the airport highway were stranded. The three magic drones that were floating in the air to serve as an early warning system were smashed at the same time. The Wyverns were responsible for this attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, the allies escaped the airport road to avoid the eyes of the Wyverns, and dispersed into the surrounding buildings. They were like a rabbit burrowing and hiding at the cry of an eagle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wyverns could capture prey from a distance like an eagle. The allied forces led by Junghoon could not move recklessly just because they disappeared from sight right now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo and his party sat on chairs inside the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s unreasonable for us to hunt the Wyverns at this point, right?” Hanho asked. “No matter how hard I think about it, I don’t think it’s reasonable to attack them at this point.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He asked and answered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party did not forget the horror they vividly experienced right after they got out of the campus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monsters that appeared with a gust and ripped apart a shuttle bus like a sheet of paper and ate the people in it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu shuddered with fear from the trauma.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t care if they are moving around as an individual. But the problem is dozens of them are flying around as a group. Besides, they are in the sky, not on the ground, so it’s just impossible to deal with them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The field boss “Wyvern Alpha Male” and the Wyverns under his command were the rulers of the Korean server sky. They were the most dangerous factor when Sungwoo and his allies had to use helicopters, the most useful means of transportation at this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since such monsters passed over this area, Sungwoo’s party had to stop all operations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I just don’t understand why these monsters appeared at this time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the Orc Lord cast the “Large Black Magic,” the countdown continued.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The allies were impatient, watching the remaining time passing gradually.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander, I think I can move again now. Considering the speed of their movement, they must have flown north of the Han River by now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. Please inform each team about this.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was about 24 hours left until the “Large Black Magic” was complete, and the allied troops had to move during the remaining time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon left behind two of the four remaining magic drones in the rear to prepare for the possible return of the Wyverns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, can’t you hear the flapping of their wings?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re fine. They say the drones are still monitoring the Wyverns.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I’m still scared…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The allied troops who were continuing their march after getting out of the building looked up and checked the sky from time to time. They were now stricken with fear that some unknown monsters might attack them from above.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But their real enemy was right in front of them. They were Red Orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unlike the Wyverns who were simply predators, the Red Orcs were invaders shaking the fundamentals of the ecology in which humans lived. As a result, confronting them was a battle for the survival of humans.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“According to the testimony of a survivor from the Kimpo region that was just posted on the community bulletin, the Kimpo field began to turn into a wasteland after the Red Orcs appeared.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While they were on the march, Minhum reported to the frontline commanders.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, since the Kimpo field was a flooded area, it was a fertile and grassy area. How come it became desolate like that overnight…?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the same phenomenon that they witnessed in Youido, which also turned into a wetland. When a group of monsters appeared in a specific area, the area turned into an environment suitable for those monsters to live in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“And I heard that their main forces, who got out of Kimpo field, were gathering near Kimpo International Airport.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are getting ready to confront us there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since they made a surprise attack after finding out the location of the allies this morning, they must have noticed that the allies were now marching toward Kimpo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They learned from the previous battles that it was disadvantageous for them to fight in a small area such as the city, so they are trying to confront the allies in a large open area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If they want to confront us in a big way, we should be willing to respond.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was a big battle in which the two sides would clash with their full might in a designated place. It was also the most preferred fight for the orcs that enjoyed fighting, and at the same time it was a situation where the Crusader Team could play the most active part.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We never know how they will attack us just like they did this morning, so we need to be prudent.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After the allied troops were ambushed this morning, Minhum decided not to look down on the orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Right. But above all else, it’s most important for us to get rid of them within the given time. It would be faster for us to finish the battle in a single fight instead of defeating them step by step,” Junghoo said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In no time, they were approaching Kimpo International Airport. They were at the end of Airport Road. A large outdoor parking lot was on the left, and the floating magic drone also noticed the runway of the airport where the orcs were gathered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! They’re the main forces of the Red Orcs…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The appearance of the mobilized orcs captured by the drone camera was shocking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something on one side of the runway was wriggling, dyed red. It was the huge number of Red Orcs mobilized there. They beat drums, shouted, and waved their flags, as if they noticed the approach of the allied forces.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Among them were monsters, including slave trolls and wasteland rhinos, lined up, and even bloody flying weapons such as the “Ballista” were seen. It was impossible to count them accurately, but they numbered at least 5,000. They were literally a huge army.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Compared with the Red Orcs, the number of the allied forces was only 814.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quite a few players were killed or injured while fighting the monsters on Olympic Highway and after they had been ambushed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since they were forced to confront the orcs this time even without filling the void, their fighting resources were running out quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Commander, the number of the enemies is far more than expected.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The allied forces tried every way to check out the strength of the enemies, but there was a limit to their efforts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Maybe we need to revise our all-out war strategy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dooung-Dooung-Dooung-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though the orcs were still far away from them, their roaring seemed to fill the whole place around Kimpo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The sound of them drumming, shouting, stomping their feet was heard everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players approaching the airport runway got cold feet at the huge eerie noise from afar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their physical ability was already beyond human limits, but they were psychologically weak.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, was it a good choice for us to come here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m not sure, but we made an irreversible choice.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I hope I can retreat even now…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were lots of them voicing their regrets and frustration, but they could not escape now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If they stepped back from here, the spell ‘Large Black Magic,’ would be completed. Then there would come a situation where they had to fight against a much stronger enemy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, they are gathered in one place. Is it possible for us to bombard them with your skill of Corpse Explosion?” Junghoon asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded, but was skeptical of the effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Of course I could try it, but it’s strange that they are gathered in such an open place because they know how dangerous it is since they had experienced it before. They are not stupid.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, they realized that street fighting was unfavorable to them, so they gathered in an open area to get the allied forces into their area to fight. They could not have forgotten the terror of Corpse Explosion in the past, so they must have set up a different trick this time. </div><h2 id="chapter134">Chapter 134</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Not surprisingly, the moment the monster birds, which were the resurrected subordinate spirits of Sungwoo, dropped the corpses over their heads, the Orc shamans reached out into the air as if on cue. The magic circles they launched were grouped together to form a huge dome-shaped shield. It was a kind of linkage spell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kung- Kuguuuuuung― Kugugugugugugugu…<br/><br/><br/><br/>The impact of the explosions scattered outside the shield. The shield might be broken when the explosions continued, but the allied forces were hard pressed for time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Orc army screamed out of joy under the shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the other hand, the allies had no choice but to become dispirited because even the “carpet-bombing,” their most important tactic, became useless.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They gathered inside the domestic terminal of Kimpo International Airport and looked at the runway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You know what? Those orcs know we’re here, but they are not ready to attack us. Obviously, they want to draw us into the kind of battlefield they want.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded at Junghoon’s remarks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think they are trying to drag it out because they want to complete the Black Magic. Even though we are in a disadvantageous situation, we cannot put off the fight.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“After all, we have to get onto their battle field.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think so.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Given all the factors, Sungwoo and his allies had no other choice but to wage an all-out war as well as a war of attrition with the orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With his face turning gloomy, Junghoon said, “Even if we win here, we still have a problem. There are too many enemies waiting for us to become weak…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon agonized not only about the battle facing them, but also about the upcoming battles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He knew his group had already been ambushed by the unidentified group called the “Evolution Society”, and it was also revealed that the Chinese forces across the Yellow Sea were trying to storm the Korean Peninsula.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the battle facing them right now was tough, Junghoon could not bet everything on it, for if he did he could not prepare for the next battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have to save our energies for the next battle… I’ve a lot on my mind.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon did not hide his worries before Sungwoo. It was true that he had been keeping the Necromancer at bay, regarding him as his rival to secure the hegemony of the Korean server, but he wasn’t blinded by jealousy strong enough to neglect this powerful being next to him. He knew that it was the safety of the Korean servers that he had to put the most emphasis on now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you bothered by the Chinese forces?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I would lie if I denied it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was obvious that the Chinese servers were much bigger than the Korean servers. So, he didn’t have to confirm that the Chinese servers were growing more and more powerful.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But what Sungwoo said at that moment was rather unexpected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Just don’t think about the Chinese servers anymore. Please keep maintaining and developing the alliance as it is now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The time is definitely coming when we need the huge group that you are craving for.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon looked at him. A huge group was what Junghoon wanted more than anything else.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo continued, “Because of this war, a group of conservative survivors have come to me voluntarily, but grouping them together and managing them is a different matter.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You’re right. That’s a difficult problem. Right now they have been united for instinctive reasons, but if they feel relaxed later, they will certainly try to compete with each other for their own interests.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It is difficult to restore a system that has collapsed. It is more difficult to do so in a chaotic situation like this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can you control that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Junghoon’s eyes flashed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If nobody stands in my way, it’s something I have to try by all means someday. Of course, blocking that obstacle is a problem.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo said with a nod, “As for the obstacle, let me get rid of the Chinese obstacle because I know where the Chinese players are and what kind of situation they are in now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, Sungwoo was aware of the enemies’ identity to some extent through the captain’s memories.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They weren’t the losers of the Chinese mainland. Rather, they were the third-class players who had been pushed out by the central force. They planned to storm the Korean peninsula after looting Taiwan to increase their power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It’s right for me to get rid of them before they grow bigger, so that I can turn this fight into hunting, not a war.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had no intention of letting his future enemies accomplish their goal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Among the two troubles, namely the Evolution Society on the Korean peninsula and the Chinese pirates, it was the latter that Sungwoo had to get rid of first because he knew their exact location.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought to himself, ‘In order to deal with such a large-scale group in the long run, a group that will support us from behind, that is, a strong system capable of supplying considerable capital, is needed. No matter how hard I think about it, the village in Suwon alone is not enough.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s request to Junghoon to strengthen the solidarity of the alliance was made for the same reason that he tried to grow the players in the village.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Over the long run they will turn into capital.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Junghoon was attracted to his request for a different reason.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I have to think about why Sungwoo suddenly made such a suggestion to me, but it is true that we need to create a larger community, namely a national community. However, I was thinking that it would come in the distant future…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, Junghoon gathered the survivors with that goal in mind from the beginning, but he could not leak it to anybody. A state must have the ability to protect its people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Then, is he now suggesting that I play the role of a state because he will support me? If Sungwoo really has it in mind, his daring push like this is close to arrogance.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, in his opinion, the Necromancer always had a reason why he was so confident.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Therefore, the Necromancer didn’t hesitate to make a decision and carry it out. That was one of the reasons why he could take action faster than others.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon thought to himself, ‘What I need to catch up with this guy are not just a high level and strong items.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he got to thinking about it, Junghoon suddenly felt deprived, but at the same time, he somehow became excited. He felt like he could reach his goal in this vague situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, he replied confidently, “Okay. If you can support me like that, I can be a little more aggressive. Let’s talk more about it after this battle is over.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon turned his head and looked at the runway. To achieve his cause, he had to overcome the obstacle right in front of him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then I should break through them first, right?” Junghoon asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As long as the orcs, stationed on the runway, would not move, it seemed that there was no other strategy than an all-out frontal attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment Sungwoo said, “There is another way to attack them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Saying so, he raised his head, “I think the orcs are looking at this battle only two-dimensionally.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Sungwoo’s opinion, there was a way for Junghoon to strike their leader without confronting the huge orcs one by one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, the allied forces crossed the domestic terminal and exited the runway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I feel like we’re playing some kind of sport. I feel like I’m leaving the locker room, entering a huge arena, facing my opponent and waiting for the start of the final game. Haaaaa…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho talked a lot when he was nervous. However, since ordinary people tended to be silent when they were nervous, no one responded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whooooooong-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment they came out to the runway, a gust of wind passed, blowing the wild breathing of the players away. The cold air that circulated in the open space made their leg muscles stiff.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The runway was wider than expected. Wherever they looked, it looked like the gray asphalt occupied half of the runway. But when they turned their heads to the front, there was a huge wave of red orcs on standby.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dooung-Dooung-Dooung-<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if they came running to sweep everything, the huge army of the Red Orcs was now slowly moving to prepare for the attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everybody, line up!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Line up by groups! Tankers, come forward!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wizards, go to the center, not the rear! The battlefield is wide, so be prepared for the possibility that they will surround you!” </div><h2 id="chapter135">Chapter 135</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>With the commanders shouting to their members, the allies began to form their positions for the fight. However, everyone felt they were on the defensive, compared with the Red Orcs’ overwhelming force.<br/><br/>It looked like the allied forces would disappear like dust the moment they collided with the orcs.<br/><br/>“Man, this fight is hopeless.”<br/><br/>“We are going to be killed.”<br/><br/>“Be quiet. It’s too late for us to run away.”<br/><br/>When they were done lining up for battle, Junghoon, the supreme commander of the allied forces, stepped forward.<br/><br/>Everyone looked at him. Even though his fame had faded a lot with the arrival of the Necromancer, he was still a powerful tall knight with a splendid fighting record.<br/><br/>He looked around the allies. They looked very serious and fully ready as if they were preparing for their last moment.<br/><br/>Junghoon slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“As you know, we have continued to fight and win impossible battles from the very beginning of this game until this very moment.”<br/><br/>His clear voice resonated throughout the runway.<br/><br/>“Even this moment is just an extension of our victory! And after we win this fight, even more impossible fights will be waiting for us!”<br/><br/>Gradually raising his voice, he raised his finger to point at the Red Orcs.<br/><br/>“There will be more and more difficult moments waiting for us after that. Yes, there will come ridiculous trials and hardships that will come to bring us down! If that’s the case…”<br/><br/>He closed his mouth for a moment. He lowered his finger pointing at the Red Orcs.<br/><br/>There was a moment’s silence, then he slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“Would you like to give up now?”<br/><br/>Everybody was silent at the question.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Jungwoo was serious. The game was getting more and more difficult. This ordeal would not be the final one, and they would fall in a deeper pit tomorrow.<br/><br/>“No! I won’t give up!” Someone shouted.<br/><br/>His voice was desperate, which prompted others to join him.<br/><br/>Their simultaneous shouting broke out everywhere.<br/><br/>“I’ll never give up!”<br/><br/>“Damn it! I will fight to the end!”<br/><br/>“I’m going to smash the operator of this game!”<br/><br/>Since this unknown game began, they have been struggling to survive without knowing the cause.<br/><br/>Numerous people were killed in the fighting, but they survived. They held out and survived, then finally, they began to understand and use the system.<br/><br/>At this moment, humans once again began to form a huge group to face the ordeal.<br/><br/>They might have been tempted to give up, but they could not because they saw the possibility.<br/><br/>“I can tell you clearly that from this moment on we will be more different than ever! We’re not going to endure while crouching! From now on, we will push forward!”<br/><br/>Having said that, Junghoon raised the big sword.<br/><br/>“Get ready to fight!”<br/><br/>Then, the players raised their weapons at once and shouted.<br/><br/>When he reached out to the sky with his left hand, a golden flag came out from the air.<br/><br/>The flag hit and stuck to the ground.<br/><br/>-‘The area of a sacred war’ is declared in the area. (Lasts 1 hour)<br/><br/>* All allies gain automatic healing. (2% per second)<br/><br/>* All stats of ‘the Crusaders’ will increase. (+5)<br/><br/>Dooung-Dooung-Dooung-Dooung-<br/><br/>As if to respond to the allied forces led by Junghoon, the Red Orcs also poured out a terrifying shout.<br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>The orcs’ huge crying instantly eclipsed the players’ shouting, resonating across the huge runway like a stadium’s roar.<br/><br/>“Uh! Damn it! These damn orcs’ screaming is so nasty!”<br/><br/>“Let me cut your neck!”<br/><br/>The players prepared for the battle in high spirits. In no time, the huge wave of the red orcs began to move toward the players.<br/><br/>“Man, they’re finally coming our way! Get ready!”<br/><br/>“They are coming! Erect your shield!”<br/><br/>“Prepare the magic!”<br/><br/>The Red Orcs began to cross on the runway like a huge tide. The runaway shook as if there was an earthquake.<br/><br/>Goooooooooo-<br/><br/>“If we are defeated, the Korean Peninsula is doomed!”<br/><br/>“We must win!”<br/><br/>“Let’s win!”<br/><br/>Soon, the frontline allied troops started attacking the orcs.<br/><br/>“Fire!”<br/><br/>“Pour it out!”<br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>Right before they collided with the orcs, they fired all kinds of magic and skills.<br/><br/>Explosions were all over the runway with flames soaring. The orcs moving at the forefront were frozen with freezing magic, and dozens of arrows poured out behind them one after another.<br/><br/>But the number of the orcs coming toward the allied forces in droves seemed never to decrease.<br/><br/>“Damn it! They don’t seem to decrease at all!”<br/><br/>“Prepare for a crash!”<br/><br/>There were simply too many orcs. The Red Orcs pushed in endlessly despite the overwhelming firepower of the allied forces. It was like throwing a stone into a wave.<br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/>Their shields shook violently. The tankers held out to the end, clenching their teeth.<br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>“Argh! Damn it!”<br/><br/>“Push them!”<br/><br/>After pushing the orcs with the shield push skill, they stabbed them with their spears.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>The orcs fell like a domino, but dozens of axes flew in from behind and struck the shields.<br/><br/>They had no time to readjust their posture to attack.<br/><br/>“Watch out! They are getting around the shield wall!”<br/><br/>“Block them! Block them now!”<br/><br/>The battlefield was so wide that it was impossible for them to make the best use of their position to attack. Tankers surrounded the healers and tried to protect them as much as possible, but there were limitations to their resistance.<br/><br/>“A shaman appears in the front! Prepare for his magic!”<br/><br/>“A rhino is charging from the right! Provide cover fire!”<br/><br/>Moreover, the orcs were not simply attacking them as a huge group. Not only did they fire powerful magic at the allied forces, but they even rushed, riding on the giant beast, the “Wasteland Rhino.” It was a monster that could tear through the shield wall with a single stroke.<br/><br/>“Shoot that damn rhino!”<br/><br/>“Concentrated fire!”<br/><br/>The Wasteland Rhino, who had been charging at full speed, was struck by dozens of arrows and crossbows before falling down in front of the shield wall.<br/><br/>Thud-<br/><br/>It was a close call, but that wasn’t the end.<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is that?!”<br/><br/>A huge flying weapon, a Ballista, was advancing toward them. Soon, they would be in its attacking range.<br/><br/>A Ballista was a weapon made to destroy the shield wall. As soon as it was loaded, it was almost certain that everything including the shield wall would be destroyed instantly.<br/><br/>“Hold out! We have to lead the enemies into this area! That’s the core of our operation!”<br/><br/>“Separate them from the Orc Lord as much as possible!”<br/><br/>And there was a reason why Junghoon induced such a reckless all-out war with the orcs.<br/><br/>He intended to strike at the heart of the enemy leadership.<br/><br/>And the moment when the Red Orcs scattered while rushing toward the allied forces,<br/><br/>Gust, flying in the sky, came close to the ground. At the same time, somebody fell down on the ground from his back.<br/><br/>Whoooooong-<br/><br/>It wasn’t a corpse this time. It was the Necromancer, falling with a fluttering dark green robe.<br/><br/>Then, black smoke filled in the air hundreds of meters high in the sky, then huge bones began to form. It was none other than Ogre Skeleton.<br/><br/>The Necromancer climbed the giant’s back. Just before touching the ground, the giant stretched out his right arm forward.<br/><br/>Blue flashes emanated.<br/><br/>Quaguaguaguagua!<br/><br/>The lightning hit the center of the Red Orc group. As if lightning fell, the Orc shamans who were preparing their shield rolled around here and there roasted like barbecue.<br/><br/>Then, Ogre Skeleton and the Necromancer landed on top of them.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in this area.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Death Response’ begins in this area.<br/><br/>Black smoke quickly spread out.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>The next moment, dozens of troll skeletons poured out of the black smoke.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuh…<br/><br/>They smashed the orcs that were not conscious and dispersed.<br/><br/>Then, they started to line up in a circle around a certain space.<br/><br/>After that, the zombies ran out and took their positions among the troll skeletons.<br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/>In the middle of the orcs’ camp there was created a huge fence made up of undead wearing bone armor.<br/><br/>This whole process was completed thanks to only one person’s control.<br/><br/>“It’s nice and cozy.”<br/><br/>At the edge of the fence appeared the very man who planned and controlled all these events, Lich with a giant scythe, namely Sungwoo. </div><h2 id="chapter136">Chapter 136</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>“…I’m sorry to come here so suddenly,” Sungwoo muttered, then put down the item in his left hand on the floor.<br/><br/>It was an object that looked like a Thermos, but black smoke was rising from it, slowly engulfing the whole area around them.<br/><br/>It was the “Purified Breath of Abyss (jar)” installed by the Evolution Society members at Youngdungpo Station. It was an item that released fatal gas when the lid was opened.<br/><br/>When Sungwoo stormed the main base of the pirates, he used it once.<br/><br/>-The Breath of Abyss is now being released. (11% remaining)<br/><br/>“I just want to talk with you alone.”<br/><br/>Having said that, Sungwoo was looking at the center of the fence.<br/><br/>Gruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh-<br/><br/>There was a group of orcs there. Orcs wearing black armor and flags on their back were on alert against Sungwoo.<br/><br/>At first glance, they looked like elite troops, and a crown made of bones was seen between their shoulders as they stood very closely.<br/><br/>-The warlord monster ‘Orc Lord’ has appeared.<br/><br/>He was none other than Orc Lord.<br/><br/>“There you are!”<br/><br/>Now, the tide of the battle began to change. The orcs, who were rushing toward the allied forces, quickly turned their course and began to retreat to save their leader.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/>They, who were more frantic than usual, rushed toward the bone fence built by Sungwoo in advance. They were charging very fast as if to break the fence right away to save the Orc Lord.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>But as soon as they approached the fence, roaring beastly, they bounced back violently. The fence was not that weak for them to break through quickly.<br/><br/>-‘Synergy effect’ is given due to team play.<br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/>-Category: Synergy of personnel<br/><br/>-Condition: Attribute of commander (Level 2) + 30 or more members required.<br/><br/>-Effect: Attack power increase (+6%), defense power increase (+6%), additional damage (+3%) when mounting a joint attack against a single enemy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Giant (5th stage)<br/><br/>-Category: attribute synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: 50 or more ‘Giant’ attributes<br/><br/>-Effect: Reduces damage from the attack by small and medium-size opponents (-40%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ironclad Knights (Phase 5)<br/><br/>-Category: Armor synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: Equipped with 50 or more ‘Full Plate Armor’<br/><br/>-Effect: Increases armor defense (+30%), Forms a shield equivalent to 40% of defense.<br/><br/>Obviously, this kind of synergy was created by optimizing all synergies for holding out to the end.<br/><br/>Therefore, it was like a barbarian army assaulting a fully armed knight. In other words, it’s like hitting a rock with an egg.<br/><br/>Pusheeeeeeeeeeeee―<br/><br/>Besides, the ‘Breath of Abyss’ encroached on the inside of the fence, and black smoke rose through the huge bones. The black smoke stopped the attacking orcs.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuuuh! Kueeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/>Then, the trolls’ axes fell over their heads.<br/><br/>-You have earned 1,200 gold by hunting the ‘Red Orc Warrior’.<br/><br/>-You have earned 1,200 gold by hunting the ‘Red Orc Warrior’.<br/><br/>-You have earned 1,200 gold by hunting the ‘Red Orc Warrior’.<br/><br/>Even if the fence was smashed, it was revived by the power of Lich. Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>Of course, they couldn’t hold out indefinitely. The Ballista rotated and started aiming at the allied forces. Then, five or six ‘Wasteland Rhinos’ charged toward them.<br/><br/>The moment the fences collapsed here and there, a huge number of orcs would dig through the gap to rescue the Orc Lord at the risk of their lives.<br/><br/>“We don’t have much time anyway.”<br/><br/>Minsok approached behind Sungwoo’s back. Orun was also standing next to him.<br/><br/>“There are about 20 bodyguards guarding the Orc Lord. I think they are stronger than normal orcs. What do you think is the most effective way of defeating them?”<br/><br/>Minsok lifted his big sword and took a posture as if he was racing toward them.<br/><br/>“Well, let me explode them right away.”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“Well, I’m going to use what I have used in the past. I intended to use it anyway.”<br/><br/>At that moment, they heard an eagle crying above their heads. When Minsok looked up, Gust’s four legs were grasping something tightly.<br/><br/>They were the bodies of the killed orcs. Then, they began to fall over the heads of the Orc Lord and his bodyguards.<br/><br/>“Goodbye!” Minsok muttered.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>The explosions smashed them. The giant bodyguards surrounding the Orc Lord bounced out in all directions.<br/><br/>“Checkmate!”<br/><br/>At the same time, Sungwoo, Minsok, and Orun ran forward immediately.<br/><br/>Immediately after Sungwoo’s surprise attack, the orcs’ offensive against the allied forces was markedly reduced.<br/><br/>In terms of the system, their greatest goal was to complete the “Large Black Magic,” so they instinctively turned to protect the Orc Lord who was preparing the spell.<br/><br/>However, it was still early enough for the allied forces to be relieved.<br/><br/>“They are going back!”<br/><br/>“They are focusing their attack on the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>The orc forces returned and went to attack Sungwoo. If Sungwoo failed, the allies would also fail.<br/><br/>“Everybody, get rid of the Ballistas! Charge!”<br/><br/>At Junghoon’s order, the allied forces dispersed, then began to fiercely chase the orcs.<br/><br/>Their first target was the Ballista. That huge crossbow operated by a pulley had the power to smash a troll skeleton with just one stroke.<br/><br/>The Ballista had been advancing a little while ago to break the shield wall of the allied forces, so it was very close to the allied army now.<br/><br/>“Wuuuuuuuuuuahhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>“Charge!”<br/><br/>“Take out those ugly monsters!”<br/><br/>Shouting at the top of their voices, the players aimed at the backs of the returning orcs.<br/><br/>Some of the orcs turned and confronted the players, but they were soon easily defeated because their leader had been ambushed, which led to the collapse of their command system.<br/><br/>“Kill them! Kill them!”<br/><br/>“Dirty orc bastards!”<br/><br/>While firing a barrage of arrows on the orcs behind their back, the players realized that their victory was around the corner.<br/><br/>“We’re almost there! Take control of the Ballista!”<br/><br/>Thanks to the fierce attack by the allied forces led by the Crusader Team, they finally reached their first target.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>A large 4-meter-long crossbow mounted on a four-wheeled wheel was in place, ready to fire. The pulley pulled the protest tightly while rotating.<br/><br/>Just before the Crusaders reached it, however, Ballista fired a huge steel spear.<br/><br/>“Damn it! Hurry up!”<br/><br/>The steel spear, 2 meters in diameter, flew in a parabolic shape, penetrating through the troll skeleton. The giant skeleton collapsed, and the orcs were seen jumping in.<br/><br/>But that was the last shot from Ballista because the Crusaders killed the archers.<br/><br/>“We’ve secured one Ballista!”<br/><br/>“There are two more on the right!”<br/><br/>The players moved around quickly to get rid of the orc remnants and secure the Ballistas.<br/><br/>Several orcs came to their senses to try to reclaim the Ballistas, but they couldn’t break through the allied forces unless they could overwhelm the allied army numerically as they did before.<br/><br/>“No way, damn bastard orcs!”<br/><br/>“Load the arrows! Let’s shoot them!”<br/><br/>While the players were confronting the orcs fiercely, the archer players started to operate the Ballistas. After learning to operate it, they began to aim the bows toward the charging orcs.<br/><br/>A huge iron bar was launched.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>With one stroke a dozen orcs collapsed like dominoes.<br/><br/>“Wow! What a great success! Keep firing!”<br/><br/>“Now defend the Ballista!”<br/><br/>If the allied forces kept up the fighting like this, they could pull off a miraculous victory.<br/><br/>But something unexpected occurred in the thick of the fighting.<br/><br/>“Uh? What did you say? Tell me again!”<br/><br/>Minhum stepped back and started shouting at the top of his voice, holding a walkie-talkie.<br/><br/>As if something ominous happened, his face turned white.<br/><br/>“Commander!”<br/><br/>Then, he hastily started looking for Junghoon.<br/><br/>“What’s going on?”<br/><br/>“This is a radio from the magic drone surveillance team! Right now they are coming from the north…”<br/><br/>The Crusader Team was operating a “magic drone surveillance team”.<br/><br/>Two wizards were conducting a surveillance operation in a nearby safe place. They helped the allied forces a lot by watching the whole area with a magic drone and conveying the status of the battlefield and the variables of the battle to them.<br/><br/>Even now they discovered something unusual and reported to Minhum.<br/><br/>Minhum opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“The Wyverns are approaching this way, according to the surveillance team.”<br/><br/>“…” </div><h2 id="chapter137">Chapter 137</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Junghoon also could not hide his embarrassment at Minhum’s report.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did you just say Wyverns?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The herd of Wyverns, which they thought had already passed over the allied forces and flown north came back at the decisive moment when the allied forces had completely defeated the orcs led by the Orc Lord.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How close are they to our allied forces now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our surveillance team is currently monitoring everything within the range of up to three kilometers, so the Wyverns will appear very soon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Were they coming back after hearing the noise of the battlefield? In fact, it was unreasonable to expect the Wyverns to pass over this area by accident. Besides, it was also unreasonable to think they didn’t notice the noisy and crowded battlefield while flying over this area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was unreasonable to expect them not to return.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon closed his eyes for a moment. Soon, he opened his eyes and turned his head toward the battlefield, then shouted, “Everybody, retreat! Evacuate into the building right now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If the Wyverns arrived, they would try to eat all of the players and orcs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In such a situation the victory or defeat on the battlefield would no longer matter. It was right to save their lives and reserve their power for the future battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do we have to retreat suddenly?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Players who did not know the situation were greatly embarrassed. The Wyverns were too fast for Junghoon to repeat his order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The field boss ‘Wyvern Alpha Male’ has appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Huge shadows lined up over the runway. Those on the runway turned their heads up and looked up at the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crazy! They’re Wyverns!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their huge wings that came along with a great gust filled the northern sky like a black veil.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t one or two. A huge number of Wyverns poured out into the sky, so that half of the sky was covered in darkness in a moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A terrible grotesque cry resonated wildly on the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their long eyes were filled with greed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although it was a fierce fight between the allied forces and the orcs, with their fates at stake, they were no more than the Wyverns’ delicious prey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh! Run away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are coming!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wyverns folded their wings and descended fast. Then, pushing their giant claws forward, they passed through the battlefield. When they soared into the sky again, screaming loudly, they were holding a handful of players and orcs between their terrifying claws.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhhhh! Help me!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Someone’s scream soared into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>While soaring into the sky after hunting successfully, the Wyverns collided with other Wyverns and lost the prey. Three players were let loose and fell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh! Ahhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the Wyverns flew in like a herd of hunting dogs, fighting to claim the prey first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While being chewed, the players’ weak bodies were shattered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo also noticed that terrible scene.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 900,000 gold by hunting the warlord monster ‘Orc Lord’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo succeeded in thrusting his sword into the heart of the Orc Lord after bloody fighting, but he could not find the time to recover the item.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! What the heck is going on?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo suspected that it was because of somebody’s operation of the system that the Wyverns were sent at this crucial time. So, he clung to Bone Drake’s body and observed the Wyverns closely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Wyverns were spinning around the battlefield like a swarm of crows. Then, they nosedived and grabbed the prey with their huge claws.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Immediately after grabbing the prey and soaring, all kinds of pieces of flesh fell. In addition, given that the bone fragments were raining down from the sky, it was obvious that they were only focused on devouring their prey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I have to let them know that they shouldn’t eat anything randomly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had no intention of falling into their prey helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned the “monster birds” to pick up two orc corpses, then dispatched them to the Wyverns. Then, he turned his head and looked for Junghoon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Junghoon!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While leading his men to the evacuation area, Junghoon turned his head upon hearing Sungwo’s voice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ballista! Have Ballistas ready!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shouting at him like that, Sungwoo pointed at the sky with his index finger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon seemed embarrassed at the moment, but soon, he commanded the archers of the Crusader Team to load Ballistas.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Three crew members headed to the Ballistas, turning the pulleys to load steel spears.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although they didn’t know when they would be eaten by the Wyverns, they were exercising as much calmness as possible in that situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, Sungwoo controlled the monster birds to approach the snout of the lowest flying Wyvern.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Grab it now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Without suspecting anything, the Wyvern quickly snapped the prey flying toward his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, the Wyvern had no way of noticing that it was the bait.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo muttered something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment the Wyvern closed his snout, an explosion occurred in the air. Because of the explosion, the flight trajectory of the Wyverns was markedly elevated, but the altitude of the very one who suffered the explosion began to drop sharply.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaaah…<br/><br/><br/><br/>His head was drooping. It seemed that he couldn’t control his body at the shock of the explosion. Soon he couldn’t get balance, then started flying up and down dangerously before slowly falling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That meant he was now within the striking range of the Ballista.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He’s falling now! Shoot!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo shouted, two Ballistas shot steel spears at the falling Wyvern.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the spears touched his neck and disappeared into the air, but the other one hit his chest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The damage was so severe that the Wyvern could not stand it. He folded his wings and fell. Right before he fell to the ground, Bone Drake charged at him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>After grabbing his neck with his huge snout, Bone Drake shook his head and cut his windpipe at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 754,030 gold by hunting the ‘Wyvern’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those who watched the scene could not shut their mouths.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have made it! We hunted the Wyvern!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The Necromancer hunted the Wyvern!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the moment when they hunted the hellish creature that they thought they could never kill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Moreover, a huge amount of gold was obtained for a single target like the Wyvern. The amount of gold was as big as that of a raid boss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, it wasn’t gold that Sungwoo wanted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The fallen Wyvern raised his long neck and slowly spread his wings. And his flipped eyeballs were back to their original position and lit up with green light.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the birth of the Bone Wyvern.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo got on behind him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get on it, Minsok!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Oh, yes!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo called him, Minsok got on. The back of the giant creature was large enough to accommodate seven people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Next, Sungwoo summoned four ghouls and made them hang on to the Wyvern’s back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They grabbed his ribs and settled in a stable position.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fly!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hoooooooooung―<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wings of the Wyvern, now Sungwoo’s subordinate spirit, spread wide. Once its wings moved, the Wyvern began to soar into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hooooooooung― Hoooooooooung―<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Wyvern soared up a dozen meters in the air after screaming three times on the ground, then began to surge very fast into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whoooooooooooo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s ride on the Wyvern was rather different from when he rode Gust. While Gust was like a sharp sports car, the Wyvern felt like an off-road four-wheeled vehicle. His ride was rough but held a sense of stability.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you hunting Wyverns?” Minsok asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He looked up at the sky with his green eyes flashing. While flying towards such terrible monsters, he felt no sense of fear because he had already experienced death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me make them realize how it feels to be hunted by others.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ‘Bone Wyvern’, which was rising vertically, turned to the left sharply.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, a Wyvern, who was left behind alone under his feet, caught his eye. Now, the Bone Wyvern descended towards its prey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>To Sungwoo, the lone Wyvern was a prey. Sungwoo had the Bone Wyvern approach him. To be precise, he moved into a position where he could aim at his head and back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! </div><h2 id="chapter138">Chapter 138</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>When the Bone Wyvern approached him, the ghouls hanging from his side were ready to fly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Minsok, grab the wings!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo ordered, he reached out his left hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, two black chains stretched out and wrapped around the lone Wyvern’s left wing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When his wing was tied, his body tilted, reducing his speed drastically.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ghouls flew over it instantly. They landed on the target, jumping from hundreds of meters above with their unique agility.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The lone Wyvern screamed and twisted when he suffered an attack for the first time in his life,<br/><br/><br/><br/>The four ghouls stuck their nails in the Wyvern’s leather and held on to it like ticks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, they climbed up on him little by little, and began to attack the areas believed to be his vital points, such as his neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me get rid of him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shouting like that, Minsok threw himself at the Wyvern and pulled the chain in his left hand at the same time. Then, he landed on the lone Wyvern’s back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if riding a wave, he held the string with one hand and kept his balance, with his knees bent. Then, he moved forward little by little, drawing his sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a shadow cast over Sungwoo’s head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time, the lone Wyvern grabbed Sungwoo’s back. He threw his huge claws toward Sungwoo’s head, but Sungwoo steered Bone Wyvern and made a sharp turn to the left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bone Wyvern’s speed dropped, then he turned sharply to the left. He managed to avoid the lone Wyvern’s claw attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, as usual in air battles, it wasn’t difficult to escape once one was caught from behind. The shadow above his head followed him persistently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pick! Pick! Pick! Pick!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo lifted the repeating crossbow and fired it, but to no avail.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He could not inflict painful damage to the huge Wyvern.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 850,000 gold by hunting the ‘Wyvern.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Time remaining until you prove your credentials: 3,702 days<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that Minsok succeeded in hunting the Wyvern. Sungwoo turned his head and looked at one Wyvern falling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Wyvern that was falling spread his wings again. He has gained a new power and a new owner, namely Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could not afford to pay attention to him because he was attacked by a claw the size of a blade. Bone Wyvern folded his wings and descended. The claws passed through the tail of Bone Wyvern.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come out.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Faced with the rough wind, Sungwoo summoned a skeleton on the back of Bone Wyvern.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right after he was summoned, Orun curled up in the harsh wind, then grabbed the bones of Bone Wyvern not to be blown away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Go!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, when Sungwoo issued an order, Orun let go of the bone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His little body was swept away by the wind and flew back. At the same time, he drew a knife from behind his back and turned around in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he faced the Wyvern following Sungwoo. He pushed his giant beak toward Orun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment Orun was bitten, he would be smashed and turned into powder.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Orun straightened his curled body and avoided his teeth by pushing hard. Then, he swung his sword after passing around his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Orun cut his right eye.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaahaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When his right eye was cut, the Wyvern lost his sense of direction. Finally, Sungwoo could get away from the Wyvern chasing him tenaciously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Wyvern shook his head and struggled. Then, he tried to fly into his crowd by flapping his wings violently because he knew instinctively he would feel most safe there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Catch him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, before the Wyvern joined his group, he was attacked by Bone Drake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With his green eyes sparkling, Bone Wyvern came from the other side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Because he already lost one eye, he couldn’t escape their attack properly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 850,000 gold by hunting the ‘Wyvern.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, a total of three “Bone Wyverns” were reborn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the ruler of heaven was still the Wyvern. In particular, “Wyvern Alpha Male” was their supreme leader in the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr―<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Wyvern Alpha Malel flew from the highest point in the sky while monitoring both the sky and the ground. He felt a different being among his race. Apparently, he had the same looks as his race but a different identity. The number of such beings was increasing from one to two, then two to three.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He regarded them as a threat and decided to get rid of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Roaring high, he charged at Sungwoo, followed by his minion Wyverns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is rather dangerous.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Minsok said that, Sunwoo also nodded and said, “I think so.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was possible for Sungwoo to catch one by one, aiming at the lone Wyvern while mingling with the herd of Wyverns, but it was impossible for him to engage in an all-out war with the whole Wyvern group. At first glance, they numbered more than 30.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I can’t even give them the slip.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was impossible for him to give such a huge number of Wyverns the slip by flying elsewhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, he could not escape through the buildings because they were low because of the height limits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment he was caught by the Wyvern, he would be torn to pieces in the air, surrounded by dozens of Wyverns without even a chance to escape. So, he should not be caught by them by all means.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I have to drive them out.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, he hit upon another idea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo took out an item from his bag. It was a thermos-shaped “Breath of Abyss (jar)”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he turned the lid, black smoke began to come out. It was the scent of death that any living being would never want to breathe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The Breath of Abyss is being released (4% remaining)<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It’s got only 4 percent left.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since Sungwoo used it twice, there was not much left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of Wyverns charged at Sungwoo all at once. It was as if dozens of piranhas were rushing towards a crucian carp in the wrong aquarium.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo steered Bone Wyvern to fly straight away while maintaining altitude. When Bone Wyvern flew forward, black smoke spread out behind him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pooooooooooh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The gas that killed living things spread more and more widely, and the Wyverns chasing Sungwoo were also buried in the smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Wyverns flipped their wings in the opposite direction and stepped back. The smoke was not toxic enough for the Wyverns to pass out, but they dispersed in all directions as if they felt it was disgusting even to touch the black smoke for a moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whoooooooooooooooo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had Bone Wyvern fly zigzag to sprinkle the black smoke over the widest possible area. As a result, almost all of the sky was covered with smoke, and there was no route for the Wyverns to break through the smoke to chase Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Wyverns couldn’t do anything in such a situation, so they were hovering in the air helplessly. Just like a dog chasing a chicken helplessly while staring at the rooftop where the chicken landed, the Wyverns were blankly looking at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nice!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, the “Alpha Male Wyvern” turned around to retreat, and his minion Wyverns also followed their leader.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s land on the ground.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Three Bone Wyverns began slowly descending towards the ground, and they found the Necromancer’s collections standing tall on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Huge skeletons such as Bone Drake, Ogre Skeleton, Ghoul King, and Troll Skeleton stood tall in the middle of the battlefield. “What the heck are they?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The monsters we’ve been fighting until now are gathered in one place.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The allied players were in the domestic terminal of the airport to avoid the Wyverns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They couldn’t believe their eyes when they watched the parade of monsters on the runway stained with blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Standing outside the building, Sungwoo was watching what was happening.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then he was lost in thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘After all, he was far from arrogant when he said he would get rid of the Chinese pirates.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer had a reason when he showed such confidence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If that’s the case….’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He could now carry out the plan recommended by Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If the Necromancer decided to help him, he could get around China’s obstruction and put pressure on them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was now imagining the Wyverns bombing a Chinese pirate fleet. </div><h2 id="chapter139">Chapter 139</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            -You have succeeded in attacking the 4th ‘Warlord Monster’ on the Korean server. (Best contributor: kor-157)<br/><br/>After the battle was over, the allies got rid of the orcs’ remnants. Although they were remnants who lost their leader, they were huge in number. While getting rid of them, both Sungwoo and Jungwoo leveled up.<br/><br/>[KOR Server Ranking (Page 1)]<br/><br/>Kangsok Han (LV. 19)<br/><br/>kor-157 (LV. 18)<br/><br/>DOCTOR-000 (LV. 17)<br/><br/>Youngdungpo Prosecutor (LV. 16)<br/><br/>Yoon Choi (LV. 15)<br/><br/>Sungwoo chose ‘Physical Strength Increase (+3)’ as the reward for leveling up because he would highly likely confront strong players in the future. In that case, he would be their target, so he did not neglect to strengthen his physical ability.<br/><br/>The players could easily guess that the only way to stop the undead unit from reviving was to kill the Necromancer.<br/><br/>Sungwoo checked the items he had obtained by hunting the Orc Lord.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Blackened Pearl Ring<br/><br/>-Class: Hero<br/><br/>-Category: Ring<br/><br/>-Effect: Curse-type magic damage increase (+10%)<br/><br/>-Description: The energy of darkness is present. It can be harmful to those occupational groups without immunity.<br/><br/>The item would be very helpful to Sungwoo because he had several curse-related skills, such as “Death Curse” and “Death Aura” that he usually activated upon triggering the Fellblade<br/><br/>‘I wonder if I had caught the boss monster after the Large Black Magic Spell was completed, would I have obtained something like Devil’s Bloodstone I had obtained from the gym?’<br/><br/>‘Devil’s Bloodstone’ was a legendary item that could take away mana. Of course, Sunngwoo didn’t regret it because he had to get rid of the monster before things got worse.<br/><br/>Night fell.<br/><br/>It got dark before the allied forces could return to Youngdungpo, so they set up a camp in Kimpo Airport.<br/><br/>“A total of 492 players have survived.”<br/><br/>Minhum reported to the commanders.<br/><br/>“Compared to the number of them when they gathered, they are less than one third.”<br/><br/>“Half of our team members were killed.”<br/><br/>“The Seongdong-gu team was annihilated.”<br/><br/>Quite a few players were killed during the battle with the Red Orcs. Those killed were not just ordinary soldiers because they were an elite force who achieved a high level by surviving in this hellish world.<br/><br/>“But those who have survived became stronger. Based on them, we must build a stronger organization in the future,” Junghoon said.<br/><br/>Like he said, they could be relieved that those who survived became much stronger than before when many of them were killed.<br/><br/>For example, Jisu reached level 15, and Hanho, who was slower than her, reached level 12.<br/><br/>In terms of the Korean server ranking, Jisu ws No. 7, while Hanho was No. 27.<br/><br/>However, there was one difference according to the grade of the job among those whose level was almost the same. In the case of Jisu, she didn’t have the opportunity of awakening even though her level was high. This seemed to be the case because she was not given an ‘exclusive quest’.<br/><br/>As for this, Hanho explained his thoughts on the exclusive quest with some complaints.<br/><br/>“When I analyzed the information posted on the community bulletin, the exclusive quest or the opportunity to awaken is a dirty and disgusting discrimination that is only given to 4-star and 5-star jobs. I would say this is kind of a new rank of this era.”<br/><br/>He continued with a smile as if he reached nirvana.<br/><br/>“That is, those with 4 stars and 5 stars are the stars, those with 3 to 2 stars are supporting actors, and those with one star like me are extras.”<br/><br/>It was true that the weight of the game changed, depending on which card they drew when the game began first.<br/><br/>“By the way, Hanho, you had two chances to draw a card, but how come you drew only one-star card?”<br/><br/>“Well…”<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>“Pardon? Oh, nothing. Actually, my real job is a chopstick-tossing master and a community analyst. Hahaha!”<br/><br/>“Hanho, don’t be too heartbroken.”<br/><br/>At that moment, the players who were patrolling the inside of the airport building returned.<br/><br/>They seemed to have found something.<br/><br/>“There is a shop inside the International Terminal, but it’s a little different from the existing one.”<br/><br/>“Right. There is a message we can’t get access to it.”<br/><br/>The strange shop found by the reconnaissance team was allegedly located in a duty-free shop in the International Terminal.<br/><br/>So, Ansok said, touching his bald head, “A store? If it’s a store, don’t we have to go there by all means? Since we had a hard time collecting gold, it’s time for us to get some good items.”<br/><br/>Just like he said, they needed to increase their strength by purchasing various items at the store. However, most groups tended to limit the use of free gold.<br/><br/>“Why don’t some of the commanders go and check it?”<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo and his friends also joined other commanders in heading to the shop.<br/><br/>In fact, they had no time to use the store, so they accumulated a lot of gold. Finally, the time has come for them to use that gold.<br/><br/>A red question mark icon was flashing above the entrance of the duty-free store when they arrived.<br/><br/>“Wow! It’s definitely different from existing shops!” Ansok said, swallowing in excitement.<br/><br/>“But why can’t we go in?”<br/><br/>“We’ll find it out when we get there. I think I can get in, though.”<br/><br/>Although Ansok said that with an air of conceit, a message appeared as soon as he got there.<br/><br/>-You need a ‘secret store coupon’ to enter this shop.<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is this? We can’t get in!”<br/><br/>“I can’t, either. What the heck!”<br/><br/>Ansok and Kangyoon, who tried to enter it first, met some resistance and stepped back.<br/><br/>Junghoo and Minhum also tried in vain to get in.<br/><br/>“A secret coupon…”<br/><br/>Others just gave up without even trying to enter it.<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo appeared among them. The commanders naturally stepped back.<br/><br/>“No way…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo stepped into the entrance of the duty-free shop.<br/><br/>-Would you like to use a ‘secret store coupon’? (Y/N)<br/><br/>Secret store coupon. Sungwoo remembered that he obtained one after he won the first awakening. It was given to a total of 50, and Sungwoo was the 9th who received it.<br/><br/>It seemed that even Junghoon was not included among those 50 people.<br/><br/>‘A secret store? Can I get the items that are not available at regular stores?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo clicked Y. Right after that, his body disappeared into the store. Those standing around the store looked puzzled because only one person, the Necromancer, entered the space they could not dare to enter.<br/><br/>“Shit! Only that guy again!”<br/><br/>“Why is it that only that person can do anything?”<br/><br/>“Is he like a VIP?”<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The inside of the shop was a normal duty-free shop. However, a huge screen was installed in the middle of it, and white light was radiating from the ceiling beam project.<br/><br/>-Sit down.<br/><br/>A message appeared on the screen. In front of the screen was an antique leather chair.<br/><br/>Sungwoo sat in the chair. Then, the screen moved to the next message.<br/><br/>-A total of 5 carefully selected items will be released one by one. If you are willing to buy, say “buy”.<br/><br/>* You have 10 seconds to make a decision.<br/><br/>* Items that you have passed cannot be purchased.<br/><br/>‘So, should I decide whether to buy or not within 10 seconds? It’s perfect for impulse purchase.’<br/><br/>-The first item is now revealed.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Golem Manufacturing (Skilled Grade) Parchment<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: Consumption<br/><br/>-Effect: When you use it, you can get the skill of ‘Golem Manufacturing’.<br/><br/>-Description: You can create a huge golem using nearby materials. Materials may be added, depending on the job.<br/><br/>* Price: 1,000,000 gold<br/><br/>‘1 million gold needed in manufacturing Golem?’<br/><br/>-10 seconds left.<br/><br/>The total amount of gold Sungwoo had at the moment was 10,565,540 gold. That’s one tenth of that amount. Is this skill worth 1 million gold?<br/><br/>“Yes, I have to buy this one…”<br/><br/>Obviously, this is a skill that will strengthen Sungwoo’s undead army. If he can use different materials, depending on the job, Sungwoo can manufacture Golem by using ‘corpses’.<br/><br/>-The second item is now revealed.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Set of 3 panacea<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: Consumption<br/><br/>-Effect: When you use it, all the ‘status abnormalities’ can be canceled.<br/><br/>* Price: 2,000,000 gold<br/><br/>‘This is an item that I could select as the Hidden Stage reward. But was it such an expensive item?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t know when he would use the panacea, but he felt it was too expensive to use gold right now.<br/><br/>‘Let me pass.’<br/><br/>Considering the fact that his job itself was immune to curses, he felt that he would lose money by buying it.<br/><br/>-1 second left.<br/><br/>-You’ve run out of time. </div><h2 id="chapter140">Chapter 140</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>-The third item is now revealed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Leap of skill level increase<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Consumption<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: If you use it, you can increase the level of a specific skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Price: 3,000,000 gold<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time it was 3 million gold. It seemed that the price increased by one million gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It’s not bad if this will increase the skill level.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unlike the stats, Sungwoo had no choice but to obtain the skill by selecting the “skill” item when leveling up. He sometimes received parchment that gave him random skills, but the odds were extremely low.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Moreover, in order to increase the skill level, he had to pick two identical skills, so the odds were even slimmer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It’s definitely a good item. However, if I buy this here, I can’t buy 4 million gold and 5 million gold that will be released later.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>What he had now was about 9.5 million gold. That’s all he possessed for now, and he couldn’t know what the next items would be. In this situation he had no other choice but to gamble.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, he decided to pass.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have ran out of time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The fourth item is now released.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Shadow King’s Bracelet<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Bracelet<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Increases muscle strength (+3), increases physical strength (+3), increases agility (+3). When you injects magical power, you can instantly move as a shadow within a radius of 100 meters. (Waiting time 10 minutes)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Price: 4,000,000 gold<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, how come this is coming out of here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo got the Shadow King’s Robe before obtaining the Shadow King’s Ring. After that, a hidden quest was issued, asking him to collect all the remains of the Shadow King.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, he could not go and find the remains by himself, so he was just sitting idle until now. As always, he obtained this randomly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-6 seconds left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Considering that he invested one million gold before drawing the “Shadow King’s Ring,” the required gold was four times that amount. However, since he obtained it by hitting the jackpot, he could not conclude that the value of this item was only one million gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This option isn’t that bad. Besides, its synergy effect with the items I currently have is also good.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Above all, he had to consider the rewards that he could obtain until he completed the quest “Heir to the Shadow King”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Buy it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Sungwoo accepted the item falling from the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Shadow King’s Heir: Collect Relics (3/4)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, he had only one stage left until he completed the quest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s see what comes out when we collect all the sets.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The fifth item is now revealed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Resurrection order (specify location)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Consumption<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Resurrects to a designated location upon death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Price: 5,000,000 gold<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Resurrection…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he was killed by Drake, he learned a passive skill he didn’t know until then.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Resurrection was actually among the Necromancer’s job characteristics. But the waiting time was 31 days.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The resurrection passive skill was activated only a few days ago, so he had to wait for a long time to use it again. If he was killed within that period, all would be over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-4 seconds left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was literally buying one life for 5 million gold, but he could not take it too easy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If he invests 5 million gold elsewhere to become stronger, can’t he overcome the danger of being killed several times?<br/><br/><br/><br/>-1 second left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Buy it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Honestly, it was an impulse purchase. Being able to overcome death once was not a losing business.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I may not be able to buy it elsewhere.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Item disclosure now ends.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You will be automatically driven out of this place in 10 seconds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sounds good.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He spent 10 million gold, but he obtained substantially useful items.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next morning, the allied forces returned to Youngdungpo Station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon started working on the organization of<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was originally what he wanted to set up. Besides, since there was already a group called the “Alliance Army” in the Seoul area, he could use that organization for his purpose.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In addition, Sungwoo promised to deal with external forces such as Chinese players, so he could put more effort into it. Of course, that made Sungwoo’s presence much stronger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Junghoon, you need to keep one thing in mind.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is it? Please go ahead.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our enemy is not just the Chinese pirates.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You’re talking about the Evolution Society.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Evolution Society rang unpleasant whenever he heard the name.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Right. They are taking roots everywhere now. So, you have to keep an eye on that organization. So, I want you to form a team for systematic surveillance composed of professions related to magic drones and rogues.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It meant the creation of a kind of intelligence agency, a group intended to recognize and cope with dangers in advance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was only natural that they must guarantee information power in order to develop into a stronger group in the future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I will take care of it as much as I can.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Junghoon organized a wide area surveillance team composed of bandits and wizards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their goal was to locate all groups of survivors in Seoul and Kyonggi area and form a wide network to control them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party decided to take a rest for about a day. In fact, they had been fighting without a break and engaged in large-scale battles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But they couldn’t take a long break.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, Necromancer!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Heyon, who had returned to Kyodong Island, came back in haste.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They have already appeared!” she shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She said unknown ships appeared in the Yellow sea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although Sungwoo said he would take care of the Chinese players, it was inevitable that they felt a sense of crisis in the whole Youngdungpo area because they arrived much earlier than expected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After hearing the news, Junghoon came to see Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I heard that they have already appeared. What are you going to do?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was calm, and his reply was simple, “Well, I’m going to put them all under the sea.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Had the pirates on fishing boats ever imagined they would be bombed?<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to Heyon, the unidentified fishing boats that appeared in the Yellow Sea disappeared after spying the coast of Kyodong Island and Kanghwa Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players in Kyodong Island prepared for the possible battle and watched the situation closely, but fortunately, there was no situation that could be worrisome.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, if they are wise enough, they won’t come attack us recklessly. I heard that Sungwoo killed all the advance party members of the Chinese players.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho was right. The fact that the advance party of up to a thousand people was annihilated overnight was not only shocking but also struck the enemies with fear. Besides, they could not come out because they didn’t know who was behind the attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I think a little differently. Don’t you think they may already know about Sungwoo? Maybe they had been kidnapping the Korean server members and collecting intelligence.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu said, “If the Chinese pirates were going to target the Korean peninsula, they will try to collect all the intelligence they can beforehand.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She had a point. Analyzing the opponent’s power before starting the attack was the basics of a war. In other words, it was highly likely that the pirates discovered the existence of the Necromancer, according to Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, you said you also knew something about the pirates, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, well, I got the information about them in the same way.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Actually, the way he collected tips about them was a little different. Even if Sungwoo killed the person under interrogation, he could see his important memories.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They were driven out of mainland China and pushed here. And they called themselves Gen. Chogong, Gen. Jigong and Gen. Ingong.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? Those are the names of notorious hooligans from the old Three Kingdoms.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were the characters who led the uprising of the hooligans in the Later Han Kingdom: Janggak, Jangbo, and Jangyang.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! How can they coin such dirty nicknames? If they wanted to make a trio like that, they could coin virtuous names Yubi Hyondok, Kwanu Unjang and Jangbi Ikdok.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, it seemed that their leader was brainwashing low-level players. I think they are related to those hooligans.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo attacked Kyodong Island, he gathered information by kidnapping several pirates, and getting rid of the pirates with one attack based on the collected intelligence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo asked them what kind of skills their leader had, but their reaction was ridiculous. </div><h2 id="chapter141">Chapter 141</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Whenever Sungwoo interrogated the kidnapped pirates, he asked what their leader’s skill was, but they came up with various answers, and all of them were just ridiculous.<br/><br/>Among the replies they gave were something like this.<br/><br/>“He is great! If you want to talk about him, kill me instead!”<br/><br/>“Shut up! Talk about him? I can’t! Rather kill me!”<br/><br/>Until just a moment prior, they shuddered in fear and answered without any resistance, but they refused to testify as if they were programmed.<br/><br/>In Sungwoo’s mind, they didn’t reply like that because they were loyal.<br/><br/>Obviously, they had been brainwashed.<br/><br/>‘Every time I looked at the fragments of their memories, an unidentifiable entity appeared.’<br/><br/>There always appeared a certain character that emitted light. At a glance, the man was making a speech to low-level players in nasty clothes.<br/><br/>‘And I remember the guy telling them that those players with level 5 or below should stay.’<br/><br/>Just like Sungwoo recalled, the man used a spell only after moving those players of level 5 or higher to another location. Based on the man’s behavior pattern, Sungwoo wondered if this guy had the skills to brainwash low-level players.<br/><br/>After catching the captain, Sungwoo could confirm the identity of this self-illuminating person through the captain’s memory.<br/><br/>He was a man in a red silk robe, the head of the pirate group who called himself Gen. Chongong.<br/><br/>After hearing Sungwoo’s explanation, Hanho said, touching his chin, “Well, low-level people are following this guy? Did he compare them to the uprising of the peasants in the past? If that’s the case, that famous Chinese strategist, Yubi, was also called a superstar among the peasants.”<br/><br/>“Anyway, that doesn’t matter. Don’t get distracted because you have found something that’s familiar to you.<br/><br/>“Man, I almost made it…”<br/><br/>“Hey, just pack your luggage.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party was preparing to go to Kyodong Island. As he promised Junghoon, he intended to stop the Chinese players without the support of the allied forces.<br/><br/>Of course, Jisu and Hanho moved with him as one team.<br/><br/>A few hours later, they were prepared for a flight to Kyodong Island. Heyon and Gust, who would escort them, were also ready to go.<br/><br/>“Oh, I would like to get on a helicopter…”<br/><br/>Hanho sighed, standing in front of a Bone Wyvern that spread her wings widely.<br/><br/>Since yesterday, Sungwoo’s means of transportation had changed dramatically.<br/><br/>Ordinary men would not even want to imagine flying on such an ugly monster.<br/><br/>“Really? We’re riding on this to fly there? I think it’s going to be very interesting.”<br/><br/>Saying so, she skillfully got on the back of Bone Wyvern.<br/><br/>“Jisu, you’re formerly an athletic person, so you might enjoy extreme sports like this, but I value my life the most.”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Junghoon and Minhum came out to see them off after they heard Sungwoo’s party would leave for Kyodong Island.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I heard you are going to Kyodong Island.”<br/><br/>“Yes. We were about to start.”<br/><br/>Nodding at him, Junghonn stared at Bone Wyvern waiting on one side of the road.<br/><br/>Bone Wyvern was a monster that he couldn’t even dare to deal with until yesterday.<br/><br/>Now, he served as the Necromancer’s means of transportation.<br/><br/>Jeonghoon turned his head and looked at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Since the enemies were defeated by us, they will not dare to approach us recklessly, but we should be prepared well before they attack again. Hope we’re in your good hands.”<br/><br/>Junghoon reached out and Sungwoo took his hand.<br/><br/>“Of course. However, the Evolutionary Society guys could move if they know that I have left for Kyodong Island. So, make sure our movement is not leaked to them.”<br/><br/>“I will deploy as many men as possible to stay alert.”<br/><br/>The forces called the “Evolution Society” were still unknown. Not only their strongholds, but even the size of their forces were unknown, but they were by no means a small group.<br/><br/>The pomade-hair guy, believed to be their leader, had a job that could generate clones, and it seemed that quite a few human beasts were following him.<br/><br/>‘They will move again soon.’<br/><br/>That was a fait accompli and a forewarning.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo could not handle all of these things. That was why he needed an alliance. So, Sungwoo left the work with Junghoon then flew towards the Yellow Sea.<br/><br/>Griffin and Bone Wyvern soared into the high sky.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Muyon Lee, Heyon’s father, was the leader of the survivor group on Kyodong Island. Not long ago, his eldest brother was serving as the leader, but he was said to have been eaten by a monster bird when the pirates invaded the island.<br/><br/>Muyon said, “I think they appeared about 12 hours ago. They appeared on the sea over there, moved around the island, then sailed over to the coast of Kanghwa Island.”<br/><br/>“Are you sure they were Chinese ships?”<br/><br/>He nodded.<br/><br/>“Yes, I’m sure they’re Chinese fishing boats. A resident who has been fishing in the Yellow Sea for a long time confirmed it. They were a big headache because they crossed into our sea whenever they had a chance, then netted all the fish. So, only by looking at the waves of the sea, he could easily find out who they were.”<br/><br/>According to the kidnapped pirates, their main forces were currently conquering Taiwan. After occupying Taiwan, they set their heart on the Korean peninsula. That’s why their advance party was dispatched to Kyodong Island.<br/><br/>‘I don’t know what happened to their main forces in Taiwan, but it’s clear that they haven’t given up their ambition for the Korean peninsula.’<br/><br/>On the one hand, Sungwoo could not rule out the possibility of them landing in another area.<br/><br/>For example, the main forces that left Taiwan could land in the southern part of the Korean peninsula and move north.<br/><br/>‘It would be better for us if they did that.’<br/><br/>If that was the case, the players in the metropolitan area could buy time to recover the damages from the battle and even prepare for the upcoming war.<br/><br/>‘But they also had great confidence in taking over other servers. After taking over the Korean peninsula, they would try to increase their forces.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo felt it instinctively, but given the power of the enemy forces that he had seen in the fragments of memory, he thought it was highly likely that they would try to directly attack the metropolitan area, the core of the Korean server.<br/><br/>“Are you going to continue to stay on this island? Pirates may attack you again.”<br/><br/>“Of course. Although we were beaten by those bastards once, we won’t be again. If they attack us again, we’re going to get even with them brutally.”<br/><br/>The survivors of Kyodong Island were full of anger, not fear.<br/><br/>“How many people can fight?”<br/><br/>“I think at least one hundred can fight.”<br/><br/>The reason why he came here alone without the support of the allied forces was because it was difficult to reassign them here.<br/><br/>Therefore, Sungwoo didn’t need to reject those who would fight together. He wanted to make use of these militias as long as they didn’t stand in the way of his operation.<br/><br/>“In that case, you need to get off of Kyodong Island first. The enemies won’t choose Kyodong Island when they land the Korean peninsula again.”<br/><br/>They first infiltrated remote areas like Kyodong Island, but they were struck hard by Sungwoo while they were escaping to a wider area near the land, namely Kanghwa Island.<br/><br/>So, the next landing place for the enemies was likely Kanghwa Island or the inland coast.<br/><br/>“Okay. I will take action so that we can move by the end of today,” Muyon said.<br/><br/>“Good. By the way, do you know where the store or the forge is?”<br/><br/>When he asked, Muyon seemed to ponder over something.<br/><br/>Then he said, “Well, if I remember correctly, there is a blacksmith in downtown Kanghwa Island.”<br/><br/>It seemed that the time had come for Sungwoo to try to make something with all the weapons materials that he had neglected.<br/><br/>At that moment, somebody called Muyon. “Brother!”<br/><br/>When he turned around, two men came running to him, gasping for breath.<br/><br/>“Hah! Hah! I flew a drone just in case. And I saw many pirates…! Hah!”<br/><br/>He couldn’t speak because he was short of breath after running, so the man next to him continued, “There are hordes of pirates over the island right now! It looks like they’ve already gathered there to prepare to attack us.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked over the sea and said, “If that’s the case, we should move ahead of them.” </div><h2 id="chapter142">Chapter 142</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dozens of ships were floating around a huge container ship five kilometers south of Udo Island in the Yellow Sea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When viewed from a distance, the fleet looked like an aircraft carrier fleet, but the ships surrounding the container ship were just old fishing boats.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A private broadcast on the China-2 Server was being broadcast live on the deck of the container ship. Even though they began to broadcast it five minutes ago, the viewers watching already reached 100,000. There were still lots of people who survived in the vast land of China.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Welcome to our broadcast! You’ve been waiting for this for a long time!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly after they were done preparing broadcasting, a man wearing sunglasses jumped into the studio and started to narrate like a professional emcee.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hello everyone! We are Gen. Jigong’s Fleet of the Red Revolutionary Army!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He spread his hands with the vast ocean behind him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We are still in the middle of the ocean today, but don’t feel too safe! Even under our feet, namely in the deep sea, there are horrible monsters overcrowded there. Hahaha! So, where shall we go from here after getting out of this hellish sea?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He spread his palms over the sight of the sea. The cameraman zoomed in. At first glance, an island seemed to be visible over the horizon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We are going to Korea, the brother country of our great China in the old days! Hurray!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He wildly cheered as he pleased then took off his sunglasses and checked the chat room window. Most of the content was comments like “runaway” or “coward.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since they were pushed out because of the fierce infighting within the China-2 server, it was impossible for them to expect a normal response from the viewers watching the scene now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the man in sunglasses casually chose the chat to his liking, and replied.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did you ask us why we’re going there? Are you asking because you really don’t know? You know that our troops are taking over almost all of Taiwan, right? We are doing something that even Mao Zedong couldn’t do. And our Gen. Chongong finds his second cause in conquering Korea. I think we’re going to broadcast from Seoul next time. Hahaha!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He laughed loudly then suddenly lowered his voice and forced an eerie atmosphere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But there is one terrible villain in Korea called the Necromancer. And after driving out our advance party recently, he warned that he would not let us occupy Korean, no matter how large an army we have. But…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He clenched both fists and continued, “We won’t be defeated twice because our large fleet is moving there to smash them! Look at our fleet!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment he extended his arms, the camera turned 360 degrees and captured everything around him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were dozens of fishing boats floating around, including the container ship, and the pirates who were aboard the boats shouted all at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wuhhhhhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hurray!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Long live Gen. Chongong!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, the man in sunglasses reappeared, somewhat excited.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He shouted, pointing at the camera.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, are you watching us? Leeway, you awful spiritist! Don’t hold your head high because you have taken over Server 2! We will take over the Korean Peninsula then move to Manchuria! Manchria! If you’re confident, smash Server 1 and confront us in Manchuria!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He took off his sunglasses with his eyes glaring sharply.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“From now on, we are going to broadcast the process of occupying the Korean peninsula after killing the Necromancer! Our proud people! Please keep watching our brilliant performance!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The broadcast was scheduled to end with his shouting like that, but this was just a trailer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were going to prove the mighty presence of the Red Revolutionary Army that had been pushed out of the Chinese server by broadcasting live the whole process of crushing the Korean server, starting with the air raid on Kanghwa Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, uh! What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But there was something like a broadcast accident at that moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I saw its huge wings!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wait a minute! Isn’t it a monster bird raised by our Gen. Ingong?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something was flying in from the eastern sky. Everyone turned to the sky. Even the cameraman was zooming it in. Black birds appeared from the clouds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, they are monster birds!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But our Gen. Ingong was killed in action on Korean soil, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>All of them had an ominous feeling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, what’s that big stuff behind them?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, it’s huge! Almost the size of a bus, isn’t it? No way!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Three huge monsters appeared behind the nine monster birds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are they Wyverns?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their ominous premonition became reality.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something began to fall from the air. They were the corpses of orcs and goblins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the hell…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, there arose flames along with roaring explosions. The boats shook and pirates screamed everywhere. The fishing boats were engulfed in explosions, and debris was scattered in all directions. Then, the boats were lifted before being sucked into the deep sea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The chat window was now dominated by the viewers’ question marks<br/><br/><br/><br/>The broadcast ended urgently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the first time that the Korean server was introduced in China.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No one in the Red Revolutionary Army expected this kind of accident. Little did they think they would be hit by a preemptive attack on the vast sea, and by huge explosions at that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everybody, escape! The boat is sinking!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jump into the sea!!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Kuggugugugugugugugu…<br/><br/><br/><br/>Little did they imagine “Corpse Bombs” would rain down on them from the sky. Since they were not ready for this kind of attack, they could not make an emergency exit, let alone respond.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Many of the pirates wandered around on the decks before being buried at the bottom of the sea with their boats.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only one of them responded properly. The commander of this fleet, Jahon Lee, also known as Gen. Jigong aimed a huge hand cannon toward the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The hand cannon was fired at the monster birds in the sky. Two of them flying relatively low were shattered and scattered over the sea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, a freezing magic was activated around it, and three monster birds flying higher in the sky were swept away by a blizzard. With their wings quickly frozen, they could not keep their balance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a skill that he activated by mixing ‘Ice Wizard’, which he chose as his occupation card right after picking ‘Canon Shooter,’ so he could put spell magic in the canon’s bullet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! We can count on Gen. Jigong!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, we can win!” All the pirates cheered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, their sigh of relief did not last long.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Look over there! The killed monser birds are being resurrected!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? I saw them smashed to pieces!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The fragments of the monster birds that had been struck by the hand cannon were engulfed in green light in the air, then restored to their original figures. Then, they glide past the fleet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No. 1 is ready!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Up to No. 8, all ready! Now is the time to defend against them! Form a shield!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-A ‘Linked Large Shield’ will be deployed in the area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gen. Jigong mobilized all the wizards to deploy a vast shield around the fleet, so he could prevent the subsequent damages in advance. They would have been annihilated without his timely help.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are going back!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank God! What a relief!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the hell was going on?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, they already suffered huge damages. Seven fishing boats sank, and there were 49 casualties.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, they had no time to check out the damages. They were in a situation in which the monsters in the sea could rush after smelling blood, so they had to get out of the place as soon as possible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, we have suffered too much during that short span.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jahon climbed to the deck of the container ship and looked around the fleet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In an instant, seven ships disappeared. Originally, he had 21 boats, so one third of them were gone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, what was it exactly?” Jahon asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man in sunglasses lowered his head and said feebly, “Since they attacked us so suddenly, I couldn’t accurately identify them…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But I think you can still figure them out, can’t you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jahon didn’t have a violent temper, but he was not generous to anybody who was out of his favor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, given that he could handle the killed monster bird of Gen. Ingong, he used corpses as bombs and mounted a hostile attack against us, I could recall only one guy associated with that attack.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hearing that, Jahon frowned and slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…Necromancer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes. I’m sure he’s responsible for this attack.” </div><h2 id="chapter143">Chapter 143</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Jahon found it out after capturing and interrogating a player on the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He discovered that on the Korean server, a hero named “Necromancer” was showing an overwhelming performance, and he destroyed Gen. Ingong’s advance party.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We were defeated twice already, and by the same guy at that. We’re not on good ground now. Gen. Chongon will be very mad about us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Huei, Kuan.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man in sunglasses and the long-haired man standing behind him lowered their heads when he called their names.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, General!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jahon sighed, full of discontent, then opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our purpose is to take over that Korean land first, but we need to spread glorious rumors about us in order to return to the Chinese mainland in the future. You may be wondering why we need that, but don’t forget that Gen. Chongong has a bigger vision than we do.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Of course, I understand his vision.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I am trying to understand his big vision.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, you already broadcasted the scene of us being attacked, right? Man, we became the subject of their ridicule. Leeway, that spiritist bitch posted something on the bulletin board during that short moment, making fun of our Gen. Chongong…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jahon turned and grabbed the two men by the shoulders.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We disgraced our general against our will. Then, what should we do now? How can we recover our general’s reputation that we have disgraced?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We need to create a scene of us defeating them. We have to show that we were attacked because we had bad luck,” said the long-haired man.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jahon nodded and said, “Huei, that’s the right answer. We have to behead the Necromancer and broadcast again in front of him. You see what I mean? What I mean is we have to get rid of the Necromancer before Gen. Chongong comes back from occupying Taiwan.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Of course, I will!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I will keep it in mind.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jahon opened his mouth for the last time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Prepare a mini game. Infiltrate Kanghwa Island, register a mini game, and kill the Necromancer. Huei, can you sneak onto the island?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The long-haired man called Huei nodded. And behind him those wearing long cloaks lined up. Black driving suits were seen inside their long cloaks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s an easy job. Even if he can watch us from the sky, he can see through the bottom of the sea.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jaheon smiled for the first time and said, “Good. Activate a mini-game on Kanghwa Island, so that he can never run away. This is going to be a fatal battle. Film all the scenes of us attacking him and show it to Leeway and her players on the mainland.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jahon turned and held the railing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He has only 50 undead at most? Let me smash them to pieces, so they can never be resurrected.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo bombed the pirates, he had a magic drone accompany him. As a result, the players on Kyodong Island could also watch the bombing from the sea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Terrible flying beasts moved in tandem, dropping the corpses into the correct position.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And at the right time, the corpses exploded, smashing the old ships and burying them under the sea. The pirates were also a huge group with discipline and a system in place, so they responded quickly and unfolded a large protective shield, but they already suffered considerable damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a perfect surprise attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, Necromancer! It’s quite true as I have heard that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bet!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He smashed such a large number of boats in just a few minutes!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Players, including Muyon, could not help but admire the Necromancer’s bold and brilliant performance during such a short time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were helplessly defeated even though hundreds of them risked their lives to defend against the pirates, but the Necromancer already drove them out twice. In other words, the Necromancer has saved their lives twice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If we follow this man, we will be able to win.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I want to take revenge after winning.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Me, too. I feel like I want to kill them all and have a party over their bodies all the year round. Son of a bitch!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players who suffered painful damages caused by the pirates gnashed their teeth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were determined to stay on the island until the end, seeking revenge against the Chinese pirates with the overwhelming hero called the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A little later the Necromancer and Heyon, who successfully completed the first-strike operation, returned to the island. The leaders of the island, including Muyon, came out hurriedly and greeted them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you. You were so amazing.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It was really awesome.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo didn’t show off because he knew it was a one-sided victory, but it wasn’t a perfect victory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The pirates are a bigger group than we think.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>During the first attack, Sungwoo destroyed nearly 1,000 pirates. Considering that the number of allies was only 814 during the final battle against the Red Orcs, it was a huge number.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the Chinese pirates who came for the second invasion seemed to be twice that number. They mobilized a huge container ship for the players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They are estimated at least 3,000.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>If so, what is the number of their main forces now attacking Taiwan?<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, those from the Chinese mainland did something big. Since the start of the game, there were so many players killed in action that it was impossible to count their exact number, but as many as players also survived.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Although we mounted a massive attack against the Chinese pirates, they are still up and running. They can lead a much larger army to attack us, or they can try to land with the current forces. Besides, they might prepare defense against our air bombing.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muyon said, nodding at his remarks, “I think we have to prepare for that in a hurry. While you were attacking them, we were done preparing to move to Kanghwa Island. Minguk, have you filled up the trucks with gas?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, brother. I packed everything and loaded the trucks. We can start right away.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were moving systematically, as if on cue. It was clear that they decided to fight the pirates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded, then said, “Then, let’s go right away. I have to stop by the smithy you mentioned before.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo said that, Muyon turned and shouted, “Start right away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Start!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everyone, get in the truck!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Players started to exit Kanghwa Island through Kyodong Avenue. Just in case there would occur an contingency situation, Heyon’s griffin and Sungwoo’s flying undead flew around in the sky and escorted them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were a total of 258 survivors in the Kyodong Island group, but not everyone could fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to Muyeon, there were only about 100 people who could fight because a significant number of them were slaughtered during the Chinese pirates’ first invasion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Anyway, I didn’t need a large number of combat troops.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was thinking of mobilizing the players of Kyodong Island for coastal surveillance. He could fight the pirates alone, but surveillance inevitably required a lot of manpower.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly after they safely passed Kyodong Ave, Sungwoo stopped their trucks near the Marine Corps’ post and gathered the group’s players, including Muyon in one place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Just like we inflicted a huge damage to the Chinese pirates, we could also suffer damages from their ambush. So, you have to closely monitor all coastlines.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As for surveillance, the coast of Kanghwa Island is wider than expected, but we are short-staffed right now. So, we have to think about how to make use of our personnel effectively.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Brother, even if some of our survivors can’t fight, they can do surveillance, so why don’t we assign as many people as possible to the surveillance job?” Minkuk said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muyon agreed with him and said, “As he said, I’ll deploy all the personnel and all the equipment for surveillance. Everyone is dreaming of taking revenge on the Chinese pirates, so they will do their best.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, please. The pirates may dispatch a small number of people and attempt to monitor or ambush us. It would be impossible to block them completely, but at least you need to discover their invasion before their fleet approaches us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muyon immediately formed a group to patrol the coastal roads and moved them. He also took turns flying two magical drones. In fact, it was surprising that there were two high-end drones in this small group. It seemed that someone was lucky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The rest of the players set up a camp in a place called the “Kanghwa Dolmen Gymnasium.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a new building with a fairly large stadium inside, so it was a suitable temporary residence for a large number of people. </div><h2 id="chapter144">Chapter 144</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            In addition, the building was located inland, so Sungwoo and his party could buy some time to respond to the enemy’s surprise attack. The building was also adjacent to a big boulevard, so they could escape to the city of Inchon through the nearby Kanghwa Bridge if needed.<br/><br/>“Okay, everyone, move! Stack the daily necessities on one side, and put the weapons on the entrance wall. Make as much space as possible around the door because we need to be able to get out in case of an emergency.”<br/><br/>“Do we have to jump right out of bed and kill those Chinese bastards?”<br/><br/>“That’s right. If you want to kill them first, put your sleeping bag near the entrance. I have already secured a space there.”<br/><br/>Like Muyon said, the survivors of the Kodong Island group were full of anger, not fear.<br/><br/>“Come on in, guys! I’ll kill you all this time!”<br/><br/>“Even if it doesn’t come now, I will somehow take revenge.”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Heyon was having a hard time persuading a little child. For some reason, the child, who seemed to be an elementary school boy, holding a shield as large as Sungwoo’s upper body in hand, was throwing a tantrum at her.<br/><br/>“I can fight, too. So, I’ll fight!”<br/><br/>“You can’t! You’ll be in big trouble!”<br/><br/>“I’m level 3, too! I have killed a goblin before.”<br/><br/>“You can’t do anything with level 3. Don’t you know that?”<br/><br/>“That’s why I want to fight because I want to level up!”<br/><br/>“How come you are so stubborn, boy?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo got involved in the quarrel between the two while approaching them to ask her about the location of the forge in Kanghwa Island.<br/><br/>“Hey, Mr. Necromancer!”<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>The child ran to Sungwoo suddenly, then said, “Please let me fight, too. Tell that sister I can fight, too! I have to fight to get stronger, right? If I don’t fight, I have no choice but to keep being weak!”<br/><br/>Heyon was on the spot at the moment in embarrassment. She shook her head secretly while looking at Sungwoo. The child had a point, but this was not a fight for an elementary school boy with level 3.<br/><br/>After all, Sungwoo said, shaking his head, “No, that’s not true, boy.”<br/><br/>“Pardon? Then, what should I …”<br/><br/>“Because a dead person cannot be strong.”<br/><br/>“Well,… but…”<br/><br/>“If you go out to fight recklessly, you will only raise the level of others.”<br/><br/>The child dropped the shield as if he was shocked.<br/><br/>“You should know when to fight, and you have to fight in a smart manner. So, you want to be strong? Think if this is the right time to fight.”<br/><br/>“Yeah.”<br/><br/>The boy soon became depressed and walked away with his head down.<br/><br/>Watching the boy, she said with a sigh, “He’s my relative’s younger brother.”<br/><br/>“If that’s the case, your father…”<br/><br/>“That’s right. The elder brother of my father served as our leader…”<br/><br/>She continued to speak in a small voice, “But he was killed by the pirates.”<br/><br/>She said he was eaten by the monster bird.<br/><br/>“Youngin witnessed that terrible scene. Despite the great shock, he is so courageous, and I’m proud of him, but I’m worried about him because he is so stubborn in taking revenge against the Chinese pirates. I hope you won’t involve our kids in the fight.”<br/><br/>It wasn’t right to keep protecting the senior men just because they were elderly because it’s like stopping them from becoming strong. But it was important to differentiate between the battle they could participate in and the battle they could not.<br/><br/>“Our kids can’t be allowed to participate for now. We’ve lost if the moment comes when we have to mobilize our kids in the fight.”<br/><br/>Heyon nodded at Sungwoo’s remarks. She was clearly worried, though, because she had experienced it once.<br/><br/>“I don’t think it will happen because we are with the Necromancer, right?”<br/><br/>In fact, the people in Kyodong Island could get out of the hellish world thanks to the timely intervention by the best reinforcement: the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“By the way, do you know where the forge is? I asked your father, but I couldn’t get his answer because he was on patrol. ”<br/><br/>“Ah, yes! I know.”<br/><br/>Has the time finally come for him to combine items?<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Black human shadows were climbing through the cracks of the rocks on the southern shore of Kanghwa Island. There were a total of eight men.<br/><br/>The players on the island were watching the shore, but they couldn’t notice their underwater infiltration.<br/><br/>“Now, we will use our stealth skill to enter the forest.”<br/><br/>Furthermore, when they used some skills, they disappeared into the forest.<br/><br/>A few minutes later, they reappeared from a distance, climbing a slope past the trees.<br/><br/>And finally, they stood on an unknown mountain peak. The cold breeze made their wet bodies cold, but they were busy carrying out the operation, not caring about it at all.<br/><br/>“Captain, what happens if I use this item?”<br/><br/>A masked man holding a flag with a game machine icon on it asked Hui, the leader of the team.<br/><br/>“I used an item with two higher levels than this one in Taiwan, too. As a result, we crushed the Taiwanese guys with a much smaller force after winning the mini-game.”<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Mini-Game Generator (Intermediate)<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: Event Flag<br/><br/>-Effect: If you stick a flag, a mini-game (Korean hopscotch) will be launched within a certain radius.<br/><br/>-Description: When the game is launched, an area with a certain radius is designated as a ‘mini-game area,’ and ‘occupied areas’ are formed in a total of 3 areas.<br/><br/>*Each time you occupy an occupied area, different buffs are given. When you occupy all areas, they are designated as ‘occupying forces,’ and a huge buff is given.<br/><br/>“Actually, I wonder if I have to use something like this. This item can be used in our favor when a small number of people face a large number of people. Well, I think the general is trying to make sure that we do not make a mistake again.”<br/><br/>The flag was stuck on the mountain peak. Then, a pink game console icon appeared on the flag.<br/><br/>“Start the game!”<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>While he was trying to move to the forge, escorted by Heyon, Sungwoo suddenly received a message.<br/><br/>-A ‘Mini-Game (Korean hopscotch)’ will start in the affected area!<br/><br/>-Occupied area has been designated in random sites (A/B/C)<br/><br/>-Enormous buffs are given when you secure the occupied area.<br/><br/>-The area will be ‘closed’ in 15 minutes.<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is this game?”<br/><br/>“Mini-game?”<br/><br/>Even Sungwoo was embarrassed by this unexpected situation. At that moment, some noise was coming out of the radio item that Muyon gave him.<br/><br/>-Necromancer! They have appeared on the southern coast!<br/><br/>It was Muyon’s voice. He kept saying something urgently.<br/><br/>-It’s a fleet! The container ship fleet is back! They are approaching the south coast quickly!<br/><br/>‘They are coming back at the same time the mini-game starts?’<br/><br/>-And we’ve got a report from the west coast! Several fishing boats are preparing to land on the coast!<br/><br/>It was clear that the mini-game was launched by the enemy. According to the rule, they clearly intended to enter the island simultaneously within 15 minutes, namely, before the access to the local area was closed.<br/><br/>“They haven’t given us a chance to reinforce our troops….”<br/><br/>-There is an occupied area nearby. (Zone C)<br/><br/>“Uh, what should we do now?” Heyon asked.<br/><br/>Immediately after confirming the message, Jisu and Hanho approached Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo? What the hell is going on now? Is this a game in a game? What the heck is this game?”<br/><br/>Now, they had only one choice. As always, all they had to do was win according to the rules of the game. What kind of strategy should they take to win?<br/><br/>“I don’t know for sure, but I think the key is to occupy three occupied areas. They’re going to attack us by mobilizing a large army.”<br/><br/>The enemy was numerically superior to Sungwoo’s troops. So, it’s highly likely that they would most likely obtain the occupation buff by a massive attack, then thoroughly defend the occupied territory because that was the most simple and powerful method.<br/><br/>“Then how do we deal with them?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo walked out of the gym. At that moment, all kinds of red, blue, and green lights were shooting into the sky from all over Kanghwa Island. It seemed that they were the three occupied areas A, B, and C.<br/><br/>‘It is difficult to recover the occupied area after losing it. In that case, we’re going to fight them in a very unfavorable situation.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned Bone Wyvern.<br/><br/>“First, let’s take over the area and hold out because we can move faster than them.”<br/><br/>What if it was a battle of not occupying, but defending the area?<br/><br/>“Let me make them pay the price for starting the game without checking their balance.”<br/><br/>This was a battle of about 3,000 vs. 262. The inevitable death match began on the small island. </div><h2 id="chapter145">Chapter 145</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>The occupied area nearby was ‘C’ marked with a green light. It was located to the northwest of Kanghwa Dolmen Gymnasium.<br/><br/>“Hanho, take the players on standby with you and move to the yellow beam right now. Take over the area there,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/>The C area was the place that they could occupy first, and at the same time, it was the farthest from the pirate fleet now landing on the southern coast of Kanghwa Island. Therefore, it would be relatively safe and serve as the last fortress for Sungwoo’s forces.<br/><br/>“Heyon, you monitor the situation in the sky and inform the people below by radio. If you find the enemy’s magic drone, destroy it.”<br/><br/>“Yep!”<br/><br/>She nodded, then ran toward Gust. The players of Kyodong Island also prepared for the battle systematically. Since they have been waiting for this moment, vowing to take revenge, they were full of determination rather than embarrassment.<br/><br/>“Jisu, let’s go to the blue light,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/>The next closest place was the blue light, occupied area B. Jisu and Sungwoo got on Bone Wyvern, which soared into the sky instantly.<br/><br/>As the altitude increased, the location of the two beams of light in the south became clearer.<br/><br/>The blue light area was located in the middle of Kanghwa Island. And the last occupied place, the red light, seemed to be located at a mountain peak in the southernmost part of the island.<br/><br/>At that moment, some noise came out of the radio. Sungwoo put the radio to his ear.<br/><br/>-They are landing on Dongmak Beach right now!<br/><br/>It was Muyon’s voice. He seemed to be on the southern beach checking the movement of the enemies. Dongmak Beach was near the red-lit occupied area A.<br/><br/>“Got it. Don’t approach them. Just go to the area with the green light. Since the enemies are also running a drone, you will be spotted if you get near them.”<br/><br/>– Yes, I understand!<br/><br/>Sungwoo already reached the blue-lit area near occupied area B. It was inside a small theme park with a lawn square and a maze.<br/><br/>“Look at that flag!”<br/><br/>Like Jisu said, a flag was firing up a light. That seemed to be the object of the occupied territory.<br/><br/>“Let’s go right away!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo had the Wyvern land near the flag, and he ran towards the flag.<br/><br/>The alphabet ‘B’ was spinning around on the plain-looking flag. Sungwoo approached it boldly and grabbed the flagpole.<br/><br/>-Occupation starting now. (Cancellation is not possible.)<br/><br/>“What the heck?”<br/><br/>His hand got glued to the flagpole like a magnet. He couldn’t take his hand off from it no matter how hard he pulled it.<br/><br/>-Occupation underway (100 seconds left.)<br/><br/>* You cannot take offensive actions during occupation.<br/><br/>* All the subjects of summons are incapacitated.<br/><br/>This was a very unfriendly game because Sungwoo was never informed of such important information in advance.<br/><br/>“Jisu, please watch your surroundings. We cannot move during the occupation.”<br/><br/>“Yeah.”<br/><br/>She pulled out her sword and looked around. It was a lawn square, but because it was not maintained for a long time, it was lush with weeds. So, there were plenty of places for her to hide.<br/><br/>-Occupation underway. (91 seconds left.)<br/><br/>A countdown message was displayed above the flag.<br/><br/>-Occupation underway. (90 seconds left.)<br/><br/>However, Jisu wasn’t distracted while watching out the surroundings carefully by using all her senses.<br/><br/>There was nothing she could feel right now, but there was a high possibility that the pirates divided their troops sporadically to try to occupy the island.<br/><br/>As expected, Jisu sensed something unusual.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I hear something coming this way.”<br/><br/>A little farther away, a magic circle began to be drawn in the air. It was quite large, estimated to be 7 meters in diameter.<br/><br/>When the magic circle was completed, the portal opened and armed men poured out in droves. There were a total of 12 pirates.<br/><br/>-Occupation underway (84 seconds left)<br/><br/>“Ugh! Damn it. What a rough ride for an expensive order!”<br/><br/>“Damn, I guess the wizards are giving us trouble on purpose.”<br/><br/>They stood up, groaning, then noticed Sungwoo and Jisu.<br/><br/>“What the heck?”<br/><br/>“Huh? Stand up quickly! They got here first!”<br/><br/>“Really? Already?”<br/><br/>It seemed that the pirates also did not know that Sungwoo responded to their landing so quickly. They guessed that when faced with a mini-game for the first time, it usually took time for people to figure out the situation, so the Koreans in Kanghwa Island would face the same situation.<br/><br/>“But there are only two out there, right?”<br/><br/>“Yeah, one of them can’t move because occupation is underway at the moment.”<br/><br/>They watched the countdown that appeared above the flag.<br/><br/>-Occupation underway (71 seconds left.)<br/><br/>“One minute is enough.”<br/><br/>“Of course. Kill them!”<br/><br/>The twelve pirates pulled out their weapons and rushed at Sungwoo and Jisu. They were holding axes. As a result,  was getting synergy, so Sungwoo could get a buff to increase attack power and attack speed for 20 seconds from the start of the battle.<br/><br/>“Hey, just 20 seconds is enough to kill them!”<br/><br/>But Jisu stepped back, grabbing her sword. Her gaze was still fixed on the front. She was not in a hurry while checking the remaining time until the occupation.<br/><br/>’63 seconds left.’<br/><br/>She was now guessing exactly how much time was left.<br/><br/>“Just one girl is out there!”<br/><br/>“Just cut her arms because we want to play with her after occupation.”<br/><br/>At that moment, they threw an ax toward her. She bowed down to avoid the ax.<br/><br/>The next moment she threw herself to the left without raising her body.<br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/>The ax was stuck where she was standing. The ax that flew behind her came back like a boomerang. It was her skill.<br/><br/>“Don’t do tricks!”<br/><br/>Jisu raised her body and her sword. The pirates, who already approached her, swung axes at her shoulder.<br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/>Two weapons clashed. At first glance, she seemed to be unable to withstand their axes, but she invested a lot in her muscle strength.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>One of the pirates staggered for a moment. The next moment her blade cut past his neck.<br/><br/>The head of the man standing behind him was cut off.<br/><br/>Two of them fell to her sword.<br/><br/>-You have earned 9,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/>-You have earned 10,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/>The level of those enemies could be checked by the amount of gold. Although it was above average, they were far behind Jisu at level 15.<br/><br/>They flinched and stepped back.<br/><br/>“Damn it! We’ll be dealing with her, so other guys go and attack the occupying man!”<br/><br/>-Occupation underway. (53 seconds left.)<br/><br/>They rushed towards Sungwoo, who was defenseless at the moment. No matter how high Sungwoo’s level was, he could not deal with ten enemies at the same time while protecting somebody else.<br/><br/>“Kill the guy occupying now!”<br/><br/>Three pirates aimed at Sungwoo and one of them at the forefront threw an ax at him.<br/><br/>At that moment, Jisu moved. The moment she took one step, her feet jumped several meters ahead as if the ground was folded. She was right there in front of them.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>She landed in the space between Sungwoo and the pirates.<br/><br/>Jisu swung her sword to block the flying ax.<br/><br/>“Damn it! Where did she come from so suddenly?”<br/><br/>‘Tracing Footstep’ was Jisu’s newest skill. After grasping the opponent’s movement with a transcendental sense, she could reach their target in an instant by using that skill.<br/><br/>She jumped off the ground. Her blade moved three times before the pirates, who were charging at Sungwoo, even got into fighting position. Red droplets splattered in all directions. Jisu passed by them and ran straight to the pirates in the rear.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>The pirates hurriedly lifted their weapons and changed their posture. Behind the woman in the red gym suit running like a wild beast, they saw three colleagues falling after they were cut by her sword. The moment they turned to her, something passed by their necks.<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>“Gather together!”<br/><br/>With only 45 seconds left, six were killed. Now the pirates were getting confused about the countdown on the flag. They didn’t know what that meant.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>While they were stricken with fear, the woman dressed in red moved without hesitation.<br/><br/>Just like a maniac who enjoys slaughter, she swung her sword.<br/><br/>She was standing right in front of them when they recklessly tried to catch up with her.<br/><br/>Whenever they moved recklessly, they had their necks cut before they knew it.<br/><br/>-Occupation underway (10 seconds left.)<br/><br/>When 10 seconds were left, Jisu stopped moving.<br/><br/>“I’m done.”<br/><br/>She rubbed her face to wipe off the blood. During the occupation, she not only protected Sungwoo but also annihilated the pirates.<br/><br/>-Friendly forces occupied ‘B Point’.<br/><br/>* Buffs are applied.<br/><br/>* Reoccupation is not possible for 5 minutes.<br/><br/>[Buff list of the mini game]<br/><br/>“Well, If I couldn’t move, I was thinking of cutting off my arm and getting out…Man, I think I was wrong,” Sungwoo said to Jisu.<br/><br/>Honestly, he was deeply touched by her brilliant fighting. </div><h2 id="chapter146">Chapter 146</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>“I am really proud to hear that from you, Sungwoo since you are well ahead of me in everything,” said Jisu.<br/><br/>She then rubbed the blade on the killed man’s clothes.<br/><br/>-Allied forces occupied ‘C Point’.<br/><br/>* Buffs are applied.<br/><br/>* Reoccupation is not possible for five minutes.<br/><br/>Then, the message about the success of the occupation of C Point appeared. It was where Hanho and the players were headed.<br/><br/>“Hanho also seems to have succeeded.”<br/><br/>“We’ve got only one place to occupy now.”<br/><br/>[Buff list in the mini game]<br/><br/>Sungwoo earned a considerable buff effect through occupation. Since they were familiar with the rules of the mini-game and the advantages of occupation, the enemies planned to have a fatal match in the huge ring called Kanghwa Island after preemptively monopolizing the buff.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was not a man who would be easily drawn into that trick. He had enough experience dealing with a hellish game like this.<br/><br/>-The enemy forces occupied ‘A Point’.<br/><br/>They also gained buff by securing one occupied area. Now, they would try to split their troops to capture B and C points while defending the occupied area.<br/><br/>‘We have to move faster than our enemies.’<br/><br/>“Jisu, we have succeeded in occupying this area, but the enemies will try to recapture it. I know it’s not easy, but please defend this place.”<br/><br/>“Are you going to go to point A?”<br/><br/>He nodded as he walked to Bone Wyvern.<br/><br/>“Let’s get rid of them in an hour,” he said.<br/><br/>He had only one hour during which he could summon the Grim Reaper and maintain the condition of Lich. If he could not carry out his mission within that hour, he would be disadvantaged, for the number of skeletons that Sungwoo can control would decrease by 50, and the infinite resurrection of his subordinate spirits would be impossible. Of course, that depended on the assumption that the enemies would survive an hour of hell.<br/><br/>“Let me contact Muyon to send you a reinforcement army here. Please hold out until then.”<br/><br/>“Don’t worry.”<br/><br/>Jisoo nodded calmly.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Point A was Mt. Mani. The captain of the pirates who arrived there, Jahon, felt very annoyed and frustrated.<br/><br/>“We have already lost two places?”<br/><br/>“Sorry!”<br/><br/>The purpose of the enemies in starting the mini-game was to quickly occupy a majority of the occupied areas, then press down on the islanders with overwhelming buffs. In other words, they sought to kill the Necromancer, the dangerous enemy, by squeezing.<br/><br/>“Do they know the rules of this mini-game? It’s impossible because we have earned it as a reward for the special quest.”<br/><br/>“General, I’ll make sure they do not leak this information through broadcast. I think this was not broadcasted because only we witnessed it,” said Kuan, the man in sunglasses.<br/><br/>“Of course, you should.”<br/><br/>At that moment, all these scenes were being broadcast live on the “China-2 Server”. The number of viewers reached 170,000. The chat window was mainly full of sarcastic content about the Red Revolutionary Army, but the viewers also had great expectations for their occupation of Korea. They wanted the players from China to win, even though they were driven out of the mainland.<br/><br/>“Send a commando for the occupation. We’ve got only one headache there, namely, the Necromancer. We don’t know if he chose point B or C, but in the end, he’ll pay attention to only one place. In the meantime, we can occupy two places and push them out with the buff.”<br/><br/>Jahon said no matter how hard the islanders resisted, his forces would win.<br/><br/>He thought that no matter how strong the Necromancer, the No. 2 of the Korean server was, he could not control the battles that were occurring simultaneously in three places.<br/><br/>Eventually, the Necromancer would lose the buff and be killed. That was how this mini-game would end, Jahon expected.<br/><br/>At that moment, somebody shouted, “It’s a raid!”<br/><br/>“They’re striking from the north!”<br/><br/>Turmoil began at the edge of the enemy camp and spread everywhere.<br/><br/>“It’s a raid!”<br/><br/>“Undead appeared from the front!”<br/><br/>Jahon frowned at that. Black smoke soared when explosions occurred among the trees in front. There was the noise of battle everywhere now.<br/><br/>“So, you guys chose this as your battlefield, not point B or C?”<br/><br/>This was something Jahon never expected because he assumed that Sungwoo’s forces would defend their places because they were on the defensive.<br/><br/>He gave a hollow smile, then said, “This guy is really reckless. He should have defended his vulnerable rear area, but he recklessly moved into this place to attack us? What about the rear then?”<br/><br/>Jahon often heard about the bold actions of the Necromancer. He also heard that the undead that the Necromancer controlled were resurrected no matter how many times they were killed and that the Necromancer himself carried a couple of giant undead with him.<br/><br/>“No matter how strong you are, do you think you can win when you lose all the buffs?”<br/><br/>Jahon admitted to the opponent’s strength, but he thought the Necromancer’s attack now was stupid and reckless.<br/><br/>“This guy with such poor judgment is No. 2 on the Korean server rankings? The Korean server is weak, as expected.”<br/><br/>Jahon had a cigarette in his mouth, then watched the battle taking place in the woods.<br/><br/>But strangely enough, the turmoil got closer and closer.<br/><br/>“Avoid!”<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>Now, his subordinates screamed from all sides, and a huge vibration that shook the earth also grew bigger and bigger. Soon “giant undead” appeared on the ridge in the distance. They were Ogre Skeleton and Bone Drake which he had learned about after checking them out in advance.<br/><br/>“Block them!”<br/><br/>“Use magic!”<br/><br/>His subordinates were embarrassed, but they began to block them by using powerful firepower.<br/><br/>“They’re stronger than I thought…”<br/><br/>Then, troll skeletons appeared on a large scale. They pushed out his subordinates fiercely. He didn’t know there were so many huge skeletons.<br/><br/>“It looks like they got stronger in the meantime, but we can deal with them.”<br/><br/>Splatter! Splatter!<br/><br/>At that moment, a giant in the form of a mud lump appeared. It was the Golem.<br/><br/>Dozens of zombies began to jump around it, wearing full plate armor made of bones.<br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/>This time Ghoul King jumped out of the ridge and ran downhill like crazy.<br/><br/>Then, a huge shadow cast from the sky. When Jahon raised his head, Bone Wyvern, which he had seen once, flew in with its huge wings spread out. There were three such monsters.<br/><br/>“What the hell keeps coming out like this?”<br/><br/>Jahon quit smoking. He got nervous all of a sudden.<br/><br/>“Man, are they strong like this? They are far stronger than we have investigated.”<br/><br/>Soon, there appeared Lich with a huge scythe and the Death Knight with green eyes sparkling in the distance above the ridges.<br/><br/>“Necromancer…”<br/><br/>It was the moment when the Necromancer’s undead collections were introduced to China via live broadcast.<br/><br/>Originally, Jahon was confident of occupying the Korean server. He thought that his brother, Gen. Ingong, was defeated because they didn’t size up the enemy’s power accurately. He thought he was different from his brother.<br/><br/>‘Intelligence is important.’<br/><br/>Convinced of that, Jahon kidnapped a Korean server player and uncovered all kinds of information from him. The conclusions he made through the tips he thus obtained were clear.<br/><br/>“Yes, I can win.”<br/><br/>That’s why he asked Gen. Chongong, the supreme leader, to dispatch him for the mission of occupying Korea. He proudly expressed his confidence to Gen Chon.<br/><br/>“I can win if I am backed up by the fleet. When you occupy Taiwan and head to Korea leisurely, let me secure a port where you can safely land.”<br/><br/>Jahon came to this place so confidently, but he was greatly humiliated in the first fight. His forces suffered big damages when they were bombed at sea.<br/><br/>Even after such a humiliating loss, Jahon was still confident because he had some crucial intelligence. </div><h2 id="chapter147">Chapter 147</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Don’t worry, General. Although I was ambushed while I was complacent, they can not confront our large army. I’ll do my best.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, right after his forces were bombed, he confidently told the messenger from Gen. Chongong about his strategy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He also tried not to let his guard down. His use of the mini-game strategy to isolate Kanghwa Island was based on his decision to choose the best battlefield in case of contingencies and dispatch as many of his forces there as possible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But now, all his strategies fell flat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is going on now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When did his plan go wrong?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Obviously, he was not as strong as this. I heard he had only three giant skeletons. I checked everything including the related threads and photos posted on their community bulletin…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the intelligence they got was when they confronted trolls on Sunyu Island. Since then, the Necromancer’s whereabouts were never directly exposed to the community, so there was no way for Jahon to find out more about him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But how much could he change during that short period? So, Jahon thought he didn’t need to care at all, but when he faced the Necromancer right now, he was completely shocked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“General! We’re being pushed everywhere!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh! Help me!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Watch out! Zombies are coming from the right!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The enemies’ attack was more than Jahon imagined.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer’s strength had grown explosively. Besides, since he received buff by occupying B and C points, each of the undead had become incredibly powerful.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s ridiculous… How can they become so strong during that short period? How?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The bizarre undead got closer and closer. The biggest headache among them was the Golem.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, that monster is similar to what the spiritistic woman controlled…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Splatter– Splatter–<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were a total of two Golems. They reached about 10 meters tall, but their soft body, whose material looked like mud, defended against most attacks well. No matter how hard they were hit, the mud of their body was dented deeply with no fatal damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Use magic!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, it’s useless! That’s a Golem!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Golems even had a passive that offset 80% of magic damage thanks to the traits of the Golem race. They were a very annoying being with a slow but absolute defense power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, watch the sky!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Lower your head!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, Bone Wyvern and the monster birds flew overhead, dropping corpses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, a huge explosion occurred, evaporating the entire slope of the mountain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hundreds of troops were engulfed in the explosion. Furthermore, a landslide occurred, hitting the tankers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jahon began to moan with a sigh. Their attack was not over yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>After the explosions occurred, Bone Drake ran downhill like crazy and pushed everybody.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the hell is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Isn’t he a boss monster level?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A monster of that size was too big for the tankers in front to stop, so they made way for Bone Drake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Freeze his legs!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wizards decided it was impossible to kill Bone Drake. As a last resort, they cast freezing magic on his legs. At that moment, ice sprouted between the bones of his legs and joints, slowing his movement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good job!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that they succeeded in stopping that huge monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come on, little kid, let’s go!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But at that moment, something jumped down from Bone Drake’s back. It was the Death Knight and a goblin skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that? Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kueeeeeh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Call the tankers!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two swordsmen ran around and started to slaughter the wizards without the tankers’ protection.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Protect the wizards!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eventually, the tankers who were in front of them quickly moved to the rear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Lich appeared in the shadow of a tree. Then, he fired crossbows from the side of the tankers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pick! Pick! Pick! Pick! Pick!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tankers with their shields down were hit by the arrows that rained down on them. No matter how strong they were, the tankers could not endure the powerful firepower.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That guy is the Necromancer! Catch him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This fighting will be over if we can kill him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they found the Necromancer, their eyes turned. They felt all they had to do was kill him without having to deal with the undead. They knew this would be an easy game as long as they killed him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the Necromancer disappeared into the shadows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? I can not see him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Where is he?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, he reappeared in the shadows 10 meters away. This time he was behind the tanks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, when did he go there?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer then swung his right hand violently. A huge scythe swept the area, causing a gust. At the same time, four severed heads soared into the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the Necromancer raised his left hand. Again, he had a crossbow. As he pulled the trigger and fired it, six wizards behind him fell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching them, Jahon loaded his hand cannon. As if he took the situation seriously, his expression was violently distorted but he regained his reason immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hold out! Hold out! Our terrific divers moved to capture the other two areas!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This wasn’t a fight that could be decided in one battle. Under the rules of the mini-game, they could get an overwhelming buff only when they captured A, B, and C.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Right here the fate of the fight is decided.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Jahon was not discouraged, and he tried to analyze the situation shrewdly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Surely, there is a limit to his deceptive skills.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In his mind, the Necromancer’s skill would have a time limit, and that’s why he was attacking so fiercely without taking a break.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuan, Avoid colliding with him as much as possible and retreat little by little while keeping him at bay. If this fight is dragged out, we can fight in a more favorable situation.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, sir! I will deliver your message to our troops right away.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, Kuan took off his sunglasses, took a deep breath, and put both hands in front of his mouth. Then, he shouted at the top of his voice, “Stop the enemy and move back little by little!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A tremendous voice resonated through the battlefield. Then, field commanders from all over the battlefield began to repeat Kuan’s message and conveyed it so everybody could hear it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jahon drew two hand cannons. Then, he walked forward and aimed at the undead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pop! Pop!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two troll skeletons, who were advancing two hundred meters away, immediately collapsed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were supposed to be resurrected, but they didn’t. Soon, they were broken and hardened on the spot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jahon quietly smiled. “It works.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The skeleton fragments were frozen by the “freezing bullets” fired by Jahon, so they could not be reunited for resurrection. It was a pretty encouraging scene for him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer’s undead were dominating the battlefield, but they numbered less than 100, in Jahon’s eyes. So, he thought that he could inflict huge damage by incapacitating some of them. In other words, binding the undead from being resurrected could be an effective means to attack the Necromancer who didn’t know death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He aimed at the golem that got close to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Blizzard Sosa!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kwa-wa-wa-wang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>His hand cannon fired white bullets. Just like the name of the skill, ‘Blizzard Sosa’, dozens of bullets were fired at the golems.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the golems’ bodies got cold and soon froze hard. They got frozen quickly because their bodies were made of mud.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taking off his sunglasses, Kuan ran in front of them and shouted at the top of his voice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Freeze! Freeze the skeletons, so their bones can’t be reunited!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the golems’ frozen bodies were shattered and scattered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jahon felt his forces were at a disadvantage, but he clearly saw the possibility of victory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. While we are holding out like this, our terrific divers can occupy points B and C, then we can push them out.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The buff that he could obtain by occupying all three places was so powerful. And as long as his forces kept the Necromancer at bay here. it was a matter of time for them to capture B and C.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuan! Kuan!” Jahon called for him hastily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes! General!” </div><h2 id="chapter148">Chapter 148</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>“What the heck are you doing? Are you going to show the scenes of our players being slaughtered to the Chinese server?”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>Kuan looked around. Obviously, the worst situation was still unfolding, and 120,000 viewers watching it were also pouring out messages of regret and condemnation.<br/><br/>“Ah!”<br/><br/>Their purpose was to not only win the battle but also to show off and promote the glorious scenes of winning to the Chinese server. But this kind of scene wasn’t good.<br/><br/>“Turn the camera from it! To No. 2! Turn it back when the tide is in our favor after showing the scene of our divers landing on the island and killing them brilliantly! Just show the good scenes!”<br/><br/>“Ah! Yes!”<br/><br/>Kuan hurriedly turned on his phone, then set the relay camera from channel 1 to channel 2.<br/><br/>Soon, the broadcast screen was changed to the camera set up in a different area.<br/><br/>Then, all sorts of protest messages popped up in the chat room, causing an uproar. It was natural that they vehemently protested because the scenes of fierce fighting on the battlefield until a moment ago were suddenly replaced with the scene of a quiet forest. 10,000 viewers disappeared in an instant.<br/><br/>The atmosphere changed so radically the viewers got so confused. With the chirping of birds everywhere, masked people were moving secretly through the bushes.<br/><br/>“This is camera 2, and we’re now ambushing Point B. It’s very, very quiet here.”<br/><br/>The camera operator at Point B whispered. Hiding on the slope of the mountain, he directed the camera lens somewhere, where there was a lawn plaza with a blue flag.<br/><br/>“Can you see it? That’s Point B. We don’t know what’s going on behind us, but we’re going to take over this place soon. It’s our first step to victory.”<br/><br/>The camera zoomed in. Someone was standing behind a tree beyond the flag emanating the blue light.<br/><br/>It was a woman in a red sweatshirt. She seemed to be hiding, but the divers were highly trained, they could easily find out where she was.<br/><br/>“Can you believe that only one woman is defending Point B? Those Koreans left to attack our main forces,” the camera operator said, laughing slyly.<br/><br/>“Our operation is to use commandos to occupy the rear, so it seems that we have succeeded in making a surprise attack.”<br/><br/>The camera lens caught the face of a woman looking around here and there. She seemed anxious.<br/><br/>“Even that woman mistakenly thinks that she has hidden completely. As you see, very unfortunately, they don’t seem to understand the rules of the mini-game.”<br/><br/>The camera operator giggled again.<br/><br/>Then, those expressing complaints in the chat room agreed with the camera operator, then began to say Koreans were stupid, for most of the Chinese viewers also wanted to see their players would win.<br/><br/>And it seemed that the situation here was getting better for them unlike a little while ago because it seemed they tried to pull out the enemy’s main forces, infiltrate the major stronghold of the enemy’s rear, which seemed very strategic in the eyes of the Chinese viewers.<br/><br/>“Huhhhhhh… Hello, everyone, this is the power and wisdom of the mainland. Our Red Revolutionary Army is glorifying the name of the mainland to the world. Trust us!”<br/><br/>The viewers of the Chinese server fell into a thrilling situation that showed a dramatic turnaround in the tide of the battle.<br/><br/>As they intended, a series of messages supporting the “Red Revolutionary Army” began to come up one by one. This was the effect of their propaganda.<br/><br/>“Now, everyone, take a good look. Do you know who will be coming out next? The best warriors of China’s 2 servers, Huei and the terrifying divers, are approaching stealthily.”<br/><br/>As soon as the name of a celebrity appeared, the viewers in the chat room started to get emotional and passionate.<br/><br/>As a popular celebrity on the Chinese server, he was often called the most powerful warrior on the mainland, so much so that even if the Red Revolutionary Army got blamed, he was excluded as a subject of criticism.<br/><br/>“They are almost there. Can you see them? Yeah, our hero Huei! Now, it’s time…”<br/><br/>But even before the camera operator was done talking, something happened. The camera, directed toward that place, was illuminating that place where the divers were approaching.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>A woman in red clothes was drawing her sword. Her face, neck, and blade were stained with blood, and several long cuts were left on the tree she was leaning against.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>There were several corpses underneath the tree.<br/><br/>“Uh, so…”<br/><br/>The woman in red was looking straight at the camera now. Her eyes were rather empty, not just murderous and threatening.<br/><br/>100,000 Chinese server players who were watching the broadcast made eye contact with her.<br/><br/>“Damn it! We’re done….”<br/><br/>It was the moment when Jahon’s ambitious plan to occupy points B and C fell flat and was being broadcast live to the Chinese viewers.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>A few minutes ago.<br/><br/>Huei, the man who stuck the flag of the mini-game on Kanghwa Island, was currently ranked 22nd with level 15 in the “China 2 Server” rankings, and he was called the best warrior in China, but he was hesitating to take action now.<br/><br/>Even though his main base was being attacked, he didn’t take any action, while hiding in the bushes. Then, his men began to egg on him to take action urgently.<br/><br/>“Captain! We shouldn’t delay any longer. If we don’t do anything…”<br/><br/>“Right. Why are you dragging your feet like this because of that woman?”<br/><br/>“No, she is different,” Huei said, frowning and expressing deep frustration.<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“That woman is different.”<br/><br/>His subordinates tilted their heads and asked, “What do you mean?”<br/><br/>“I’m not sure, Captain.”<br/><br/>Huei moved his head to point to the corpses lying around the flag.<br/><br/>“Can you see the bodies of the No. 2 Commando Team?”<br/><br/>“Yes, I can see them.”<br/><br/>They were 12 corpses and 12 axes, which belonged to the No. 2 team.<br/><br/>“They all had the same scars. This means that they were killed by the same person using the same weapon.”<br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/>“Did the woman kill them alone?”<br/><br/>Huey nodded, then said, “She slaughtered the 12 men on the No. 2 Commando Team from the elite unit. The two guys were killed by her with a single stroke, and the three men closest to the flag fell almost simultaneously. And those bodies strewn here and there were…”<br/><br/>“They were killed while running away…”<br/><br/>“Right. That’s the evidence that they were killed while they were retreating in a hurry, frightened and scared. Even the last two guys have cut scars on the back of their necks.”<br/><br/>The No. 2 Commando Team was the unit that served as the advance party in the fleet led by Gen. Jigong. In other words, they were the first to land and attack at the forefront, so they were more brave and agile than anybody else. How could they be killed while running away?<br/><br/>“It’s ridiculous. That girl over there, who openly revealed herself like that, had such a high level as to kill them all?<br/><br/>Huei nodded, then continued, “Fortunately, she hasn’t found us yet. Even if she is a master swordsman, we can kill her if she lets down her guard. So, approach her carefully and kill her at once.”<br/><br/>The best assassins moved to kill the woman.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Sungwoo left the important base, Point B, with Jisu and left.<br/><br/>She stood leaning behind a large tree, where she could monitor the flag at Point B.<br/><br/>She blocked the enemy’s first attempt to occupy the island, but they would never give up.<br/><br/>So, she was fully prepared for the upcoming fight. But she was the only person who would protect this place.<br/><br/>Standing in the woods, she kept all her senses open, monitoring every movement around her.<br/><br/>And soon she sensed something strange.<br/><br/>‘Someone is coming. They are hiding their movement.’<br/><br/>Their movement was unusual because of their restrained footsteps and the sound of breathing. She instantly knew that somebody was approaching her stealthily.<br/><br/>‘Lots of them are coming. Six? No, eight.’<br/><br/>Those who approached Point B obviously had a professional occupation, specializing in surprise attacks and assassination. As long as they had similar traits, it was not easy for her to deal with them all at once.<br/><br/>That’s why she decided to expose her position easily. In short, it was sort of a deceptive operation. </div><h2 id="chapter149">Chapter 149</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            As expected, the enemies rushed at her as if they looked down on her when she exposed her location so easily.<br/><br/>There were a total of three who charged at her.<br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/>Jisu hit the sword of the first of them. His sword bounced off and cut the tree where she stood leaning. Seizing the moment, she swung her sword at his neck. But the man leaned back and avoided her sword, then threw himself into the woods.<br/><br/>‘He is fast.’<br/><br/>But the other two were not as agile as the man who disappeared into the woods.<br/><br/>They saw her wielding her sword, but they didn’t predict the energy of the sword emanating from its blade. The two heads were severed at the same time, falling at her feet.<br/><br/>Right after that, she turned her head and looked somewhere among the trees on the hillside.<br/><br/>Someone was hiding there, aiming something towards her. It was a camera.<br/><br/>‘Camera? Are they broadcasting this fight?’<br/><br/>It was the moment that her face was broadcast live to the “China 2 Server”.<br/><br/>Frowning, she pulled out her legs. It wasn’t just the camera that was aiming at her.<br/><br/>The enemy numbered eight, but two of them were killed. The rest of them, positioned all over the forest, were closing in on her gradually.<br/><br/>‘Arrow?’<br/><br/>They fired two arrows at her, aiming at her eyes, but she wasn’t there when they looked at the place where she had been standing.<br/><br/>“Damn it! How come…”<br/><br/>She was now blocking the only man who escaped her sword. She caught up with him by using the ‘Footstep Tracking’ skill, but the man charged at her.<br/><br/>The two swords clang against each other.<br/><br/>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!<br/><br/>Their swords collided five times in an instant. They couldn’t cut each other, but the man couldn’t withstand her power and stepped back. Then he began to get out of the woods and jumped into the lawn park.<br/><br/>‘He is different.’<br/><br/>That man was clearly different from the opponents she had dealt with until now. He was obviously a master swordsman. She rotated her wrist to loosen her muscles. Then, she went out to the lawn park to chase that man.<br/><br/>“Wow, she is so strong! It’s more fun than I thought.”<br/><br/>Actually, he was waiting for her there. He was apparently embarrassed, but at the same time, he felt the strong urge to beat her this time. It seemed as if he was enjoying the fight.<br/><br/>“How could she deal with me who chose “Barbarian” as the second occupation card? Even without the occupation buff, her muscle strength should be 27 and 30 if she wanted to deal with me. She must have invested in stats instead of drawing skills from the level-up card. What a freak!”<br/><br/>He analyzed her now, and his analysis was somewhat correct. He fought against her again to find out her stats. Obviously, he was a high-level master swordsman.<br/><br/>At that moment, something was moving. Jisu and the man felt it at the same time.<br/><br/>“No!” The man screamed, but Jisu moved faster than his screaming.<br/><br/>Her sword cut through the air, and someone’s head flew through the air a few meters away.<br/><br/>It was a surprise attack, but the body fell some distance away from her. He didn’t even dare to get close to her.<br/><br/>“What a stupid guy! I didn’t teach you like that… By the way, you are quite extraordinary. I guess your Agility is around 21?” asked the man.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“What’s your name?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“I’m Huei from a Chinese server. To put it precisely, Server 2. I’m called the best swordsman on the mainland. Are you the strongest on the Korean server?”<br/><br/>Jisu had no intention of responding to him, but he kept talking.<br/><br/>“You are a woman of few words. You must have noticed that the camera is filming this place, right?”<br/><br/>Huei lifted the sword and pointed at the camera.<br/><br/>“I’m sorry to meet you like this. I can’t play with you for long because I have to occupy Point B quickly, but it won’t take long for me to kill somebody, of course.”<br/><br/>“… But in fact, it doesn’t take long for a person to lose their breath.”<br/><br/>Smiling eerily, he pointed the sword at her.<br/><br/>“I have fought master swordsmen in China in a fair manner and beat them all. So my name is known to everyone on the mainland. Now, let me have my men step back, so let’s fight in a fair manner. I will bury your body honorably.”<br/><br/>The camera put the two in one frame. The camera operator relaying that scene couldn’t hide his excitement while broadcasting it live.<br/><br/>“Can you see them, every one! Huei is trying to cut someone with all his might. The best swordsman in mainland China! Huei’s duel begins again in this remote place!”<br/><br/>The news spread to the Chinese community that the duel between Huei, the famous man on the Chinese server and an unidentified Korean warrior, would begin.<br/><br/>Because of that, the number of viewers on the broadcast began to increase explosively as if to show Huei’s name had such a strong appeal.<br/><br/>Huei looked at her with a determined expression.<br/><br/>‘Let me cut that woman here and create a sensation on the whole server. Then, we can glorify our name and Gen. Chongong will be happy about it.”<br/><br/>Their purpose was the same. In other words, they wanted to restore the reputation of the Red Revolutionary Army, and make foreign servers such as Taiwan and Korea the scapegoats for him.<br/><br/>If Huei beats the Korean swordsman in his event, it will bring about positive publicity. Even this kind of fight was also intended as propaganda.<br/><br/>“Whuuuuu…”<br/><br/>Huei let out a rough breath, firmly grasping the hilt. Then, certain energy began to dwell in his body and the sword.<br/><br/>-‘Savage rage’ is activated.<br/><br/>* Increases muscle strength for 1 minute for 3 or more consecutive attacks (+5)<br/><br/>-‘Violent Vanguard’ is activated.<br/><br/>* Attack speed increases for 5 minutes (+25%)<br/><br/>He was now ready to do his best.<br/><br/>The swordsmen of the two servers, Korea and China, faced each other. As he said, his men hiding in the woods didn’t take any action. It may be Huei’s greed, but he wanted to make a dramatic propaganda effect by killing her one-on-one.<br/><br/>After a short pause, Huei first moved. He slammed the ground. In an instant, the distance between them narrowed. He struck at the woman’s head.<br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/>The two swords clashed. The air around them was twisted because it was surrounded by the buff. This time he was not pushed by her. He swung his sword again with confidence.<br/><br/>Clang! Clang!<br/><br/>When they clashed for the second time, she took a side step. Turning to the side, she was about to get out of his striking range.<br/><br/>Clang! Clang! Clang!<br/><br/>After colliding twice, their swords overlapped briefly. The moment the metal was crushed and sparks scattered, she moved once more. As expected, she took the side step to the left, then got out of his range, making a half-circle.<br/><br/>“You can’t get out of here!”<br/><br/>Huei took a step back not to give her any chance of attacking. He could respond to her with this little movement, and he had to.<br/><br/>At that moment, Jisu’s movement changed exquisitely. She lowered her posture and moved in the opposite direction. Huei’s eyes followed her movement, but it was so exquisite and accurate. He clearly noticed it, but before he knew it, she cut him in his ribs.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuuh!”<br/><br/>With blood gushing from his ribs, he staggered.<br/><br/>“Damn it! How could you…” he moaned.<br/><br/>She took off the blood from the blade and opened her mouth with a calm expression.<br/><br/>“Aren’t you going to ask for your men’s help before it’s too late?”<br/><br/>Those were her first words. A broadcast accident occurred again.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>“Hold out! Hold out!”<br/><br/>“Block that golem!”<br/><br/>On the other hand, the battlefield where the pirates’ main unit and the Necromancer were fighting was very tough and scary. The Necromancer’s forces kept resurrecting no matter how many times they were killed, and the giant slingshots the troll skeletons fired were comparable to catapults. They killed the tankers on impact.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>The damages caused by the continuing corpse explosions were huge, and a couple of undead swordsmen that penetrated the rear did not show any sign of falling.<br/><br/>“I know how you got involved in heinous actions! Let me kill you all!”<br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/>They were Minsok, whose eyes were radiating green light, and Orun.<br/><br/>The two defended each other’s back in the heart of the enemy camp, smashing the wizards and easily knocking out the tankers.<br/><br/>  </div><h2 id="chapter150">Chapter 150</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>“Hey, my little boy! You’re doing great, too! Good boy! Let’s move!”<br/><br/>Minsok was now different from the days when he fought to protect his family. Now that he had nothing that forced him to look at something compulsively, he raised his shield and rushed fiercely into the enemy camp.<br/><br/>Then, he swung his long sword up and down violently. Whenever he swung it, cut bodies piled up under his feet.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhh! Go away, you devil!”<br/><br/>The Chinese wizard screamed in horror.<br/><br/>“Devil? Yes, I can be a devil to protect my family, you scum!”<br/><br/>Based on his strong conviction, Minsok slaughtered those he defined as enemies. Since he didn’t have to look back to protect his family, he has been reborn as a “death knight,” who killed his enemies without hesitation.<br/><br/>A black chain stretched out of his shield, tying and dragging the enemies’ bodies.<br/><br/>Then, Orun quickly ran toward these defenseless enemies and swung his sword.<br/><br/>Orun made the most of the increased mobility inherent in his small body. Orun jumped out of unexpected places while wandering around on the complex battlefield, then dealt a fatal blow.<br/><br/>Even if the enemies defended against his attack, the moment they aimed their weapons against him, they would slip and lose their balance as if they were oiled. Therefore, Orun’s follow-up attack after they fell was right on the mark.<br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/>“Watch out for your left!!”<br/><br/>“Hey, a corpse is falling on your right! Avoid it!”<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Kugugugugugu…<br/><br/>As the fight went on, the pirates that numbered a total of 3,321 decreased rapidly. As things stood now, it was highly likely that they would be annihilated in this mini-game.<br/><br/>“Hold out!”<br/><br/>“If you hold out a little longer, you’ll get a buff!”<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the reason they were holding out to the end was that they had some conviction. In other words, not only Jahon but also the pirates were convinced that since Huei joined the occupation operation, he would certainly succeed.<br/><br/>“If Huei wins, we will win, too!”<br/><br/>“Trust Huei!”<br/><br/>Who is Huei? He defeated many swordmasters in a one-on-one confrontation and reigned as the strongest among swordsmen in mainland China. So much so that even if Chinese players spat out curses against the Red Revolutionary Army, Huei was exempt from such criticism.<br/><br/>“Soon they’ll get buff at Point B.”<br/><br/>“So, hold out until then! Next is Point C!”<br/><br/>Shortly afterward there arrived news about Huei. Since his performance was being broadcast live, they could know it in real-time.<br/><br/>“What the heck! What happened to Huei?”<br/><br/>Someone raised his voice. Even in the fierce battle, they heard his voice clearly.<br/><br/>“He was killed!”<br/><br/>It was a shock. The only person they relied on the unfavorable battlefield was killed.<br/><br/>“What did you say? Who the hell killed him?”<br/><br/>“He was killed by a Korean woman! Huei couldn’t swing his sword at her more than ten times before she beheaded him!”<br/><br/>“No way! How could that happen?”<br/><br/>“Are you sure it’s Huei?”<br/><br/>It was the moment when their last hope disappeared.<br/><br/>“How ridiculous! How can I believe he was killed?”<br/><br/>Even Jahon, who heard the shocking news, felt dizzy for a moment.<br/><br/>Kuan came to him and said, “General, they turned the camera angle to this place because camera 2 was hit by the enemy. Shouldn’t we stop broadcasting right now? We can’t broadcast the scenes of us being defeated…”<br/><br/>“No! If we end up like this, not only we and our organization but also our general are history!”<br/><br/>Jahon couldn’t give up here. Now he had only one option left. It was to defeat the Necromancer in this place. He looked around the battlefield desperately, as if he was grasping at straws.<br/><br/>“Necromancer….”<br/><br/>He then loaded the hand cannon.<br/><br/>“Necromancer, where are you?”<br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>He fired the cannons randomly and walked into the middle of the battlefield.<br/><br/>“Necromancer!”<br/><br/>And he found the Necromancer in the shadow of the trees. He was disguised as Lich in a dark green robe and a hero of the Korean server.<br/><br/>“Come on! Let me deal with you! I’m Gen. Jigong of the Red Revolutionary Army!”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“If you don’t come out, let me rush at you!”<br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>He fired the hand cannons in both hands in succession. The Necromancer created a bone shield to block the cannons, but the bone shield was shattered and his body bounced back.<br/><br/>The power of a hand cannon was different from that of arrows.<br/><br/>When Jahon loaded his hand cannon and went valiantly, the camera filmed him.<br/><br/>In fact, this scene was their last hope because Jahon made the Necromancer step back.<br/><br/>“Let me jerk you off one more time!”<br/><br/>Shouting like that, Jahon moved on toward him. The moment he stepped on the shadow of the tree, the Necromancer disappeared in an instant.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>He felt somebody’s presence behind him. Right there, somebody’s green eyes glowed. Sungwoo teleported from shadow to shadow by using the ‘Shadow King’s Bracelet.<br/><br/>“General!”<br/><br/>Kuan, who was standing next to him, called him first. He spotted the Necromancer appearing behind him, opened his mouth, and prepared to shout at the top of his voice. He felt he would be able to drive out the Necromancer when he shouted like that, but the Necromancer was faster. His huge scythe passed through Kuan three or four steps away.<br/><br/>Kuan’s head was blown away, and his sunglasses fell into the mud. Then, Sungwoo’s left hand grabbed Jahon’s neck.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>Jahon felt a sharp pain as if his spine was broken. Since Sungwoo was receiving a tremendous increase in stats due to Lich buff and occupation buff, his current muscle strength was 45. Nobody could endure such strength.<br/><br/>Sungwoo stuck Jahon’s head into the dirt.<br/><br/>Puck-<br/><br/>“Argh!!”<br/><br/>In the middle of the battlefield, Jahon was completely overpowered, losing his hand cannon.<br/><br/>Minsok and Orun approached Sungwoo and watched out for the surroundings. No pirates dared to approach them because they knew they would face the same fate if they did.<br/><br/>“General…”<br/><br/>“Now, what should we do?”<br/><br/>Even the camera operator, completely stiffened, was filming this scene. His hands were trembling. He knew it was right to end his broadcasting, but he could not judge at all because he had been following Jahon’s orders until now.<br/><br/>“Hey, smile! The cameraman is filming you.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo shouted at Jahon, looking at the camera. Underneath his smile was seen the scene of Jahon frowning, incapacitated.<br/><br/>Following the female swordsman running wild, stained with blood, this time a demon with the bones of half of his face exposed and his green eyes flashing was being broadcast on the Chinese server.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuuuuuuh…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo pressed his neck with his feet and lifted the Grim Reaper.<br/><br/>At that moment, Jahon shouted.<br/><br/>“General! Gen. Chongong! Please don’t come to Korea! Never! Never!”<br/><br/>That was Jahon’s impression of the Korean server. He realized that regardless of the reputation of the Red Revolutionary Army, his whole organization could be destroyed if they set foot in Korea recklessly, and that was his last desperate will based on his costly experience.<br/><br/>“No, you can come over and play!” Sungwoo said, looking at the camera operator.<br/><br/>“Hey, come here. Don’t end the broadcast yet.”<br/><br/>As a result, this hellish broadcast was going to continue.<br/><br/>Although they had little chance of winning, the pirates did not stop resisting.<br/><br/>“We have to fight to the end!”<br/><br/>“We can’t run away anyway!”<br/><br/>As long as the mini-game was open, there was no way for them to escape the island. Therefore, even though their leader was killed, they had no other choice but to resist strongly.<br/><br/>Sungwoo started work to get rid of the pirate remnants. He planned to occupy all three places A, B, and C, then destroy them with the help of overwhelming buff.<br/><br/>-Grim Reaper retention time (00:14:53)<br/><br/>Since there was not much time left to maintain the effects of Grim Reaper and Lich, he had to get things done quickly.<br/><br/>However, there was one problem. The moment he held the flag, he could not move, so it was impossible for him to occupy the places alone.<br/><br/>So, he called Heyon, who was on Gust to fly over Kanghwa Island, as an alternative option.<br/><br/>Soon, Heyon appeared. Gust made a turn around the foot of the mountain at tremendous speed, then landed at Point A at the peak of Mt. Mani.<br/><br/>“Necromancer! Let me occupy it now!”<br/><br/>When he nodded, she grabbed the flag.<br/><br/>-Allies are occupying it! (100 seconds remaining.)<br/><br/>“They are trying to take it over!”<br/><br/>“If we lose Point A, we’re doomed!”<br/><br/>The pirates moved to stop the occupation. However, Sungwoo’s undead blocked them.<br/><br/>When the three Bone Wyverns sat down on the peak, spread their huge wings, and raised their heads threateningly, the pirates couldn’t even dare to approach.<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>“How can we break through such monsters?”<br/><br/>Now, unlike when they occupied Point B, 100 seconds was too short for them to take any action. So, the pirates climbing the peak could not help but be devastated when they watched the number appearing above the flag. </div><h2 id="chapter151">Chapter 151</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>-Occupation by the allies is underway. (4 seconds left.)<br/><br/>“Oh, no!”<br/><br/>“It’s taken over!”<br/><br/>“We are done!”<br/><br/>-The allied forces have occupied Point A.<br/><br/>* Buffs are applied.<br/><br/>-Allies have captured all points.<br/><br/>* Additional buffs are applied.<br/><br/>[Buff list of the mini game]<br/><br/>Indeed, it was an enormous buff. It was almost like 10 levels increased at a time.<br/><br/>‘Mini-game? It’s far from a mini-game!’<br/><br/>Even if they competed with rival groups over the hegemony of mainland China, Sungwoo was puzzled about how these guys driven out of the mainland could occupy Taiwan, and now he seemed to understand. Obviously, they must have gambled on this kind of huge buff for their successful operation.<br/><br/>-The mini-game ends in eight hours.<br/><br/>This time their gamble failed. To make them pay for the price, Sungwoo and his forces were about to hunt the pirates for the next eight hours.<br/><br/>And all of those scenes were being broadcast live by the camera operator, who had been taken hostage.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a special squadron of pirates was dispatched to occupy Point C, the relics of the dolmen. However, it took a considerable time for them to travel from the southern end of the island to the northern end, and shocking news came before they reached the destination.<br/><br/>“It doesn’t make any sense…”<br/><br/>“How could our forces be defeated in an instant?”<br/><br/>They came to know that not only Huei, the best swordsman on China Sever 2 but also Gen. Jigong was killed, and Point A was conquered.<br/><br/>That shocking news drained them of hope and energy, but they decided to carry out their original mission, knowing that they could not escape from the island anyway.<br/><br/>“Everyone, wake up! We must succeed! If we give up, it’s over!”<br/><br/>“Sure. At least in this place, there’s no such thing as the Necromancer or that female swordsman. Let’s go!”<br/><br/>The special squadron attacking Point C was not small. Comprising more than 160, their average level was also over 9. They were an elite unit.<br/><br/>“We have no time! Even at the risk of our lives, we have to mount a frontal attack!”<br/><br/>Under the command of their leader with level 14, the special squadron pledged to fight bravely in the upcoming final battle. Then, they followed the lights of the flag to enter the ruins.<br/><br/>Soon, far away, the camp of the players of Kyodong Island, who were positioned around the flag, caught their eyes. They were apparently preparing for the pirates’ ambush. They seemed to number about 50.<br/><br/>“They’re less than I thought.”<br/><br/>“We can beat them even though they are backed up by enormous buffs.”<br/><br/>The special squadron lined up in front of their leader. He drew his sword and lifted it toward the sky.<br/><br/>“Get ready for the battle! Charge at them now!”<br/><br/>But at that moment something happened.<br/><br/>“Surprise attack!”<br/><br/>Something jumped from the ground behind the leader’s back. He was a man with lots of grass attached to his body and holding a dagger in both hands.<br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuuh!”<br/><br/>Because it was an unexpected ambush, the leader of the special squadron could not respond. A sharp dagger was stuck in the back of his neck.<br/><br/>It was Hanho who attacked him. He was hiding flat on the ground, with grass covering his cloak.<br/><br/>“Why did you come here so late? I almost went crazy because of bugs crawling on my body while I was lying here!”<br/><br/>Complaining like that, Hanho drew the sword from the corpse of the killed leader.<br/><br/>Suddenly, a golden shield was wrapped around Hanho.<br/><br/>-You have gained a ‘Holy Shield’ for 15 seconds with the ‘Slayer of Faith’ skill. (400/400)<br/><br/>“Captain!”<br/><br/>“Kill him!”<br/><br/>“It’s just one guy!”<br/><br/>They began to fiercely attack Hanho after learning that their leader was killed.<br/><br/>However, the golden shield around Hanho blocked all their attacks. Since his skill level increased by one step, his ‘Shield Duration’ and ‘Shield Capacity’ increased considerably.<br/><br/>So, even though the pirates attacked him, Hanho blocked their attacks effectively for several seconds.<br/><br/>Hanho threw a dagger. The dagger, which flew almost in a straight line, struck over the shoulders of the tanks and into the necks of the wizard standing behind them.<br/><br/>-You have gained 9,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/>Using the new scapegoat as fertilizer, his ‘Shield of Faith’ has been renewed. This was the advantage of this scary skill. If it had plenty of damage power, Hanho could use it as an infinite shield even in the middle of the enemy camp.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>“Damn it! I can’t break his shield!”<br/><br/>“What kind of skill is it?”<br/><br/>Hanho moved forward boldly and threw another dagger.<br/><br/>“Who the heck are you?”<br/><br/>As soon as one of the pirates shouted, Hanho’s dagger was stuck in his neck.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuuuh!”<br/><br/>-You have gained 8,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>-You have gained 6,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/>“Hey, remember me, everybody! I am from the Korean server! I’m a friend of the Necromancer! I’m the strongest sacred thief! My name is Hanho Lee!”<br/><br/>The triumphant Hanho roared sharply as if he became a street cat.<br/><br/>Then, holding a dagger with both hands, he ran toward the enemy camp. He forced his way through the tanks, somehow stabbing the dagger into their necks and ribs.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>“Push him!”<br/><br/>Since he was not wounded thanks to the shield, and his stats were greatly strengthened by the occupation buff, Sungwoo could ambush them without any fear.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>“Hey, use magic!”<br/><br/>“Since he is too close to us, it will harm our allies if we use magic!”<br/><br/>“Then pull him away from us!”<br/><br/>“He wouldn’t move at all like a tick!”<br/><br/>While the disorganized pirates were struggling hard, there was a roaring shout from the left and right.<br/><br/>“Charge at them!”<br/><br/>“Strike them!”<br/><br/>The players of Kyodong Island, who had been nearly ambushed, started the raid finally.<br/><br/>“Shoot everyone!”<br/><br/>“Kill all the pirates!”<br/><br/>“Kill every single bastard!”<br/><br/>At the order of Muyon, dozens of arrows and magic spells began to rain over the heads of the special squadron.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhh! Watch out on your left!”<br/><br/>“Too late!”<br/><br/>While Hanho was raising Aggro, they mounted a huge attack on the defenseless special squadron and suffered fatal damage in an instant.<br/><br/>“They are collapsing!”<br/><br/>“Kill them all!”<br/><br/>The players of Kyodong Island launched an attack for the final push. They closed in on them from all sides. There was deep anger on their faces when they charged. With anger fully charged on their weapons, they attacked the pirates mercilessly.<br/><br/>“Kill them! Kill them!”<br/><br/>“You bastards! How dare you intrude here again?”<br/><br/>“Do you think we’re pushovers?”<br/><br/>Among Kyodong players was a little kid, Youngin, who was the brother of Heyon’s relative.<br/><br/>The little boy threw a heavy shield and grabbed “Gladius,” his sword, then ran toward a pirate bigger than him. He swung the sword violently, shouting at the top of his voice.<br/><br/>“Argh! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>Clang! Clang! Clang!<br/><br/>The pirate was embarrassed by the kid’s attack and stumbled back.<br/><br/>“Ugh! How dare a little kid attack me?”<br/><br/>“Let me kill you! Come on!”<br/><br/>Although Youngin was only level 3, he showed a tremendous force with the help of huge stats buffs. The pirate was wielding his sword unstably, then eventually allowed Youngin’s attack.<br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/>Gladius was stuck into his neck.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhhh….” The pirate collapsed instantly.<br/><br/>-You have gained 8,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 4)<br/><br/>“Wow! I took revenge on him for my father! Revenge!”<br/><br/>The power of the buff was so great as to allow even this kid with level 3 to charge at the enemy without any fear.<br/><br/>“We’ve won!”<br/><br/>“They’re running away! Don’t lose them!!”<br/><br/>The special squadron was destroyed in an instant, and only a few remnants broke through the siege and started to flee, but they didn’t go far. The players on Kyodong Island were given movement speed buffs.<br/><br/>Finally, their battle was over.<br/><br/>“Dad, I took revenge for you…”<br/><br/>Youngin muttered while looking at his father’s relic, Gladius.<br/><br/>Someone came to him and said, “Hey, you’re fantastic, little boy!”<br/><br/>Youngin was startled to hear that. It seemed like he was caught fighting secretly by somebody else because adults didn’t like young children to get involved in this kind of terrible fighting.<br/><br/>Youngin turned to him with an anxious expression.<br/><br/>However, the other person’s reaction was favorable to his surprise.<br/><br/>“Wow, you’re pretty courageous! You’re awesome!”<br/><br/>It was Hanho, the man covered with grass.<br/><br/>“Oh, brother! Strongest thief!”<br/><br/>“Did you hear what I said? Yes, that’s me.”<br/><br/>Hanho patted him on the shoulder and moved on.<br/><br/>But Youngin shouted at him, “Hey, brother! Can I…”<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>“Can I be as strong as you, brother?”<br/><br/>“Well… like me, not the Necromancer?” </div><h2 id="chapter152">Chapter 152</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Hanho was embarrassed by Youngin’s question. Is it really good for this little kid to become as strong as a one-star thief like Hanho himself?<br/><br/>“Brother Hanho, can I fight confidently without being intimidated in front of enemies like you?”<br/><br/>Hanho hesitated but nodded reluctantly.<br/><br/>“Well, of course! It’s a bit difficult, but when I tried it, I could do it without any problem!”<br/><br/>Even after he drew the occupation cards, one-star thief and one-star priest, Hanho thought he was so unlucky because he got only mediocre items, so he was deeply touched by Youngin’s extolling of him and his fighting.<br/><br/>“Brother Hanho, you’re so cool!”<br/><br/>“Hahaha! Do you really think so?”<br/><br/>Was he in the process of becoming a hero while struggling to survive?<br/><br/>Hanho felt very much satisfied after a long time.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The terrible battlefield was captured by the camera.<br/><br/>“It’s all over…”<br/><br/>The camera operator muttered, his voice trembling. There were no trees left after the bombing. The bodies of pirates were piled up.<br/><br/>“Except for the few who ran away, our troops have been annihilated. This is a total defeat!”<br/><br/>The camera operator was broadcasting all the scenes of the fighting at the order of the Necromancer. As Jahon was killed and the pirates were on the defensive, most of the viewers left, but 20,000 were still watching.<br/><br/>[Real time chat]<br/><br/>─ chi-111004: That Korean general is similar to China Server 1’s Emperor.<br/><br/>─ Xian5523: I also recalled that emperor. I saw only his photo and heard rumors about him, but I think he looks like the emperor when I actually see him.<br/><br/>─ 壮烈: I think he is a level lower than the emperor. I heard that the emperor used more than 200 subordinate spirits in the latest battle.<br/><br/>─ 李 大阿哥: Since it is a small country, he must be a level lower than the emperor. I can’t recognize his competence, based on his victory today.<br/><br/>“Emperor? Who is the emperor?”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo asked, the camera operator opened his mouth in a subservient manner.<br/><br/>“Oh, yes. China is divided into three servers, and the hegemon of Server 1 based in Xianxi Province and Beijing, is calling himself Emperor. He conquered Server 3, so he is considered the strongest on the mainland.”<br/><br/>“But why are they saying he is similar to me?”<br/><br/>“As far as I know, that player named Emperor also has multiple subordinate spirits like the Necromancer.”<br/><br/>Most of those with the five-star occupations were specialized in forming groups.<br/><br/>For example, the Vampire Lord infected the players to get them as his followers, and the Crusader Commander made Crusaders. The so-called Gen. Chongong, whose identity was not yet revealed, seemed to be able to brainwash players below level 5.<br/><br/>However, it seemed that this guy named Emperor was different from Sungwoo by nature because Sungwoo controlled monsters, not players. Nonetheless, why are they saying he is similar to Sungwoo?<br/><br/>“What’s his job?”<br/><br/>“I’m not sure…”<br/><br/>It was natural that the strongest in mainland China would not easily leak information about himself.<br/><br/>After telling the operator to stop broadcasting, Sungwoo bound him. He planned to detain this man in order to monitor the movement of the Chinese servers because although he was in Korea now, his mobile phone stayed connected to the Chinese community.<br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo stood in front of Jahon’s body. Two hand cannons dropped near him.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Hand Cannon (Level 3)<br/><br/>-Grade: Hero<br/><br/>-Category: Hand Cannon<br/><br/>-Effect: Inject mana to load bullets. (10 mana spent)<br/><br/>It was a weapon that could inflict damage powerful enough to push back an opponent with a shield. Although Sungwoo couldn’t fire it randomly like a repeating crossbow, he could use it for a fatal attack. If the timing of the attack was good, it would be a pretty useful weapon.<br/><br/>Sungwoo took one of them and tied the other one around Orun’s waist.<br/><br/>“Although you have only one arm, try to use it well.”<br/><br/>Crackle! Crackle!<br/><br/>“As a one-armed warrior, Orun, you can’t give up the warrior synergy. By the way…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo suddenly examined Orun.<br/><br/>“If you have only one leg, what synergy will come out of it? I am suddenly curious.”<br/><br/>Pondering over it, Sungwoo looked at him, but he avoided Sungwoo’s gaze slowly.<br/><br/>“Oh, you can’t give up your excellent agility, of course.”<br/><br/>Crackle! Crackle!<br/><br/>Sungwoo continued to check Jahon’s items. They were trifling accessories compared to the ones around his body.<br/><br/>“Let me give this to Hanho.”<br/><br/>As always, Sungwoo took care of his juniors very well.<br/><br/>Now he had one last thing to do.<br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/>-You can read the “memory fragments” of the dead.<br/><br/>Jahon’s memory was regenerated.<br/><br/>The place was inside the ship. It appeared to be inside the container ship, the flagship of the pirate fleet.<br/><br/>“It is said that an angel statue was found in Taiwan.”<br/><br/>Saying so, Jahon sat down. At the long green table were the executives including Kuan and Huei.<br/><br/>“An angel statue? This is the first time since the demon statue was found on Server 1?”<br/><br/>“Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Finally, the hint about the absolute race is coming to the surface? What kind of features does the statue have?” Kuan asked as if excited.<br/><br/>‘I forgot about it. I remember there was going to be updates on the angel and the devil.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo also paid attention to it. He had no information about the ‘absolute race’.<br/><br/>“Only Gen. Chongong touched the statue. According to the general, we should receive a quest, but he didn’t tell me the details yet.”<br/><br/>“Really? He didn’t tell you about it, Gen. Jigong?”<br/><br/>Jahon, namely Gen. Jigong, nodded, then said, “It seemed difficult for him to tell me right away. He said he would tell me after conquering Seoul.”<br/><br/>“I’m very curious.”<br/><br/>“I’m curious too, but we have to focus on our mission,” Jahon said and put something on the table. It was a brown parchment scroll.<br/><br/>“Now, let’s get to the point. Shortly after occupying Kanghwa Island through a mini-game, Huei’s team will sneak into Seoul and use this scroll.”<br/><br/>It seemed that they had already set up the plan for what to do after conquering Kanghwa Island. Taking off his sunglasses, Kuan began to make a fuss.<br/><br/>“Wait a moment! Isn’t it “Devil’s Gate”?”<br/><br/>“Right. Immediately after using this, the Devil’s Gate opens for 24 hours, and all kinds of monsters will pop out. The monsters will disappear after 24 hours, but it’s enough time for them to destroy the whole area. Maybe we can occupy Seoul without letting out blood.”<br/><br/>Kuan nodded in admiration.<br/><br/>“This is an item that originally opens the hidden dungeon, but the level of difficulty is so high that it has established itself as a legendary scroll used as a strategic weapon! Do we have to use this after the mini-game? I can’t help but think it’s too precious to use.”<br/><br/>“Well, this kind of investment is nothing. The Korean server will be much more valuable to us than the Taiwan server. Gen. Chongong said we should not spare investment for this.”<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the investment he made fell flat.<br/><br/>“We’re going to start the operation now. Huei, take your assassins and set out to Kanghwa Island. Go and stick the flag there!”<br/><br/>“Yes, Gen. Jigong!”<br/><br/>The video ended there.<br/><br/>‘What is the purpose of this memory?’<br/><br/>As always, the fragments of memory showed Sungwoo something helpful. So, generally speaking, he could find some clues or information from the scenes from the fragments of memory.<br/><br/>‘I think I need to obtain the magic scroll called Devil’s Gate.’<br/><br/>Since he already won the battle, he might not be about to recover key information from it, or it could provide some information about the location of good items.<br/><br/>Anyway, he had to go to their container ship.<br/><br/>In fact, he had asked Heyon to monitor the fleet near the landing site of the pirates in order to get rid of the enemy’s remnants.<br/><br/>A little later Gust flew from the southern sky. Then, Heyon jumped down hurriedly and came running to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“I’ve seen everything! I think they are preparing to turn the course to Taiwan right now.”<br/><br/>A considerable number of on-call soldiers remained on the container ship. However, since the mini-game was not over yet, they couldn’t leave the coast of Kanghwa Island, but they could escape after nine hours.<br/><br/>“By the way, wizards on the deck are on standby all the time. I think they are holding out there, thinking they have to stop the allies forces from getting aboard the ship.”<br/><br/>Obviously, they seemed to have prepared a means to defend the fleet in case of contingencies.<br/><br/>If there were a number of wizards on the deck, like she said, it was highly likely that it would be impossible for Sungwoo to attack them or infiltrate the ship. </div><h2 id="chapter153">Chapter 153</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>“Is it difficult for us to capture the ship?”<br/><br/>“Yes, if you storm it recklessly.”<br/><br/>If the enemies deployed a large-scale shield, it would be difficult to have the undead infiltrate the ship, and the corpse explosion strategy would not work. It was a very tricky situation.<br/><br/>Of course, Sungwoo could try to deplete their mana first, but it was a very inefficient method.<br/><br/>After agonizing over it for a moment, Sungwoo suddenly looked toward the sea.<br/><br/>“Are there any monsters on the coast around here?”<br/><br/>“Under the sea?”<br/><br/>“Yes, I hear that monsters are crowded under the sea.”<br/><br/>“Ah yes. There are a lot of scary guys out there. They gather quickly as soon as they smell blood, but the pirates seem to be sailing away with electric magic. Why are you asking that?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo turned to the shore.<br/><br/>“Well, if that’s the case, let me go fishing.”<br/><br/>In fact, he was thinking of attacking the pirates from the land, sea, and air altogether.<br/><br/>The container ship, which served as the flagship of the pirates, was moving off the coast of Kanghwa Island.<br/><br/>Most of the troops landed on the island by fishing boats during the mini-game, but there were still a number of on-call soldiers guarding the flagship.<br/><br/>“They are moving out!” Heyon shouted.<br/><br/>As if they found Sungwoo’s Bone Wyvern, they picked up speed and started heading north of the island. They didn’t want to be noticed by Sungwoo, but there was no way for the huge ship to avoid Sungwoo’s gaze when Bone Wyvern carrying him was flying high in the sky. And there were still five hours left until the mini-game was over.<br/><br/>They were like a rat in a trap.<br/><br/>When the Bone Wyvern approached the ship, they immediately deployed a shield. A large shield appeared over the container ship like an umbrella. With that shield in place, Sungwoo could not infiltrate it from the air.<br/><br/>But if he hit the ship under the hemispherical shield, it’s a different story. With the waves soaring in the air, a giant sea snake stuck its head over the deck.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhhh!!”<br/><br/>“It’s a serpent!”<br/><br/>It was a “sea serpent”, a twenty meter-long monster, but the shape of its body was somewhat strange. Hard scales covered its whole body, but its bones were exposed here and there. Crucially, its green eyes sparkled from within its giant head.<br/><br/>“Uh, undead?”<br/><br/>It was a monster that belonged to an owner.<br/><br/>When the serpent climbed up the ship and shook its body, the wizards, standing on the deck to supply mana to the shield, were crushed and fell off the deck.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>“Block the serpent! Push the monster out!”<br/><br/>But it wasn’t easy. Sungwoo had to put in a lot of effort to catch that monster.<br/><br/>‘It took an hour to hunt it.”<br/><br/>While Sungwoo hunted the sea monster, he threw the bait all around the coast in Kanghwa Island. As a result, he could find a “Little Serpent,” which took him an hour to catch. It was so difficult for Sungwoo to pull it out of the sea and load it with damage, but the hard-won serpent paid off nicely. Its huge body completely took over the deck of the container ship.<br/><br/>“The shield is flickering!”<br/><br/>And he could destroy the ‘Large Shield Spell’ just by cutting off the mana supply.<br/><br/>Like Heyon said, the giant shield started to flicker and soon lost its shape.<br/><br/>“Let’s land!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo landed on the deck instantly. The game was actually over.<br/><br/>After getting rid of the remnants on the container ship, Hanho and Jisu joined and began to search it.<br/><br/>“Wow! Look at this.”<br/><br/>Soon Hanho came out with something. It was a black box the size of a laptop.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Charger (extra-large)<br/><br/>-Grade: Rare<br/><br/>-Category: Other<br/><br/>-Effect: It supplies current or charges the battery. (Remaining capacity: 69%)<br/><br/>“It was attached to the engine room. It seems that they used this to power this big ship. Isn’t this an energy revolution? There are a few more like this.”<br/><br/>Like he said, if the charger was powerful enough to move this huge container ship, it had tremendous energy.<br/><br/>“Got it. Put it back. All the lights in the ship are out.”<br/><br/>“Aha? I wondered why it suddenly got dark.”<br/><br/>Given that thousands of people were on this ship, Sungwoo could obtain a huge amount of necessities, but he found a real treasure.<br/><br/>Sungwoo went to the captain’s office.<br/><br/>A gray safe lay on an old iron desk. Sungwoo pulled out the safe with his bare hands.<br/><br/>Because he received all kinds of buffs, he could exercise superhuman power.<br/><br/>And inside it was an item he saw in Jahon’s memory fragments.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Devil’s Gate<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: Magic Scroll<br/><br/>-Effect: Opens the Devil’s Gate for 24 hours when used.<br/><br/>-Description: It creates a passage that connects with the Devil’s Gate. You can get very valuable items by exploring the Devil’s Gate, but we recommend that you don’t try it recklessly. Don’t forget that someone might come out of the door through which you can enter. (Recommended level 35)<br/><br/>It was the same as described in the fragments of memory. Its original use was a ticket with which to enter the hidden dungeon.<br/><br/>However, because the level for its use was so high, the monsters that appeared were overwhelmingly strong, so it could also be used as a strategic weapon to destroy a certain area.<br/><br/>‘Of course, it would be a bigger benefit to use it for its original purpose.’<br/><br/>A hidden dungeon of this level would surely bring about huge rewards. However, it seemed too difficult for Sungwoo to try it right away.<br/><br/>“What is this?”<br/><br/>There was one more thing in the safe. It looked like a metal item about the size of a tissue.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Vault of Oath<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: Finance<br/><br/>-Effect: Some of the gold earned by the ‘contracted player’ is automatically deposited.<br/><br/>-Description: You can register a contract by placing your palm on the safe. The vault owner can set a ‘money collection rate’, and the amount of gold earned by the contractor is automatically deposited into the vault.<br/><br/>* Collection rate: 80%<br/><br/>* Registered contractors: 26<br/><br/>* Current Gold: 13,455,048<br/><br/>“Wow! This is a windfall.”<br/><br/>It looked like a vault operated by the pirates. It contained over 13 million gold.<br/><br/>It seemed that the pirates used these items to collect all the gold earned by their subordinates.<br/><br/>The fact that there were only 26 contractors meant that there were only 24 survivors of the pirates. Now, Sungwoo got to know the number of the pirate remnants hiding all over the island.<br/><br/>‘I think we can collect effectively in the future.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo was raising several groups, for example, the Seoul Metropolitan Area Alliance with the Liberation Guild in the Suwon village as the main, and even this area in Kyodong Island.<br/><br/>One of the reasons he patronized them was because they would bring about a lot of gold in the future, and he got a very efficient item for the tax system.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The players of Kyodong Island searched all over Kanghwa Island and succeeded in eradicating the few remaining pirates.<br/><br/>In addition, they secured a huge container ship and dozens of fishing boats and set up a mechanism to monitor the Chinese community from time to time by detaining the Chinese player Xiaojun.<br/><br/>“Necromancer, if you leave it to us, we will monitor the Chinese side.”<br/><br/>The players of Kyodong Island, including Muyon, took on the role of watchers of the Yellow Sea.<br/><br/>“We will search the Yellow Sea by using the ships we have captured, and monitor the Chinese side of the community to check their movement much as possible.”<br/><br/>It was something someone had to do anyway.<br/><br/>“If you do, I am really grateful to you.”<br/><br/>“Don’t mention it. We owe a lot to you, so we will do our best, it’s our repayment for saving our lives.”<br/><br/>They were rather passive until they were attacked by pirates, but on the occasion of attacking the pirates successfully, they decided to join the Metropolitan Players’ Alliance. Of course, the reason they did so was that they had total trust in Sungwoo.<br/><br/>-The mini-game (Korean hopscotch) has ended with the allies’ victory.<br/><br/>-Reward is paid.<br/><br/>Finally, the final 12 hours passed and the mini-game was over. The shutdown of the region was lifted and huge compensation was paid.<br/><br/>-You have gained 1,500,000 gold as the mini-game reward.<br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 19)<br/><br/>During the war, they killed a huge number of players, but the EXP of the mini-game was also quite good.<br/><br/>-Choose a level up card.<br/><br/>Sungwoo chose No. 2, skill item.<br/><br/>&lt; You have acquired the skill .<br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/>-Name: Manufacturing Toxic Cloud.<br/><br/>-Grade: Basic<br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/>-Cost: 30 Mana<br/><br/>*You manufacture a cloud containing poison and spray ‘poisonous rain’ on the entire area for 10 minutes. (1-hour waiting time for reuse)<br/><br/>‘It’s a black wizard skill.’<br/><br/>It was a new skill and the black wizard-type skill at that. It was a very powerful skill that could inflict poison damage in a wide area. It seemed that the new skill would exert tremendous power in large-scale battles if it was mixed with the ‘Crystal of Chaos’ effect, which continuously consumed mana and stamina.<br/><br/>With corpse bombing, stamina-eating curses, and poisonous rain, the Necromancer’s war equipment grew more and more abundant.<br/><br/>‘It’s great.’<br/><br/>He felt like the pirates gave him treasure. </div><h2 id="chapter154">Chapter 154</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Night came.<br/><br/>“Hi, everybody, I’m the ‘holy and strongest thief’. Today’s brief news! Would you like to listen?”<br/><br/>“Go ahead.”<br/><br/>Hanho’s ability to analyze and organize the community bulletin items increased day by day.<br/><br/>It was the reason they called him a community analyst.<br/><br/>“This is the first brief news. It seems that the creation of the “Metropolitan Alliance” is progressing rapidly. Hearing that news, the survivor coalitions in the metropolitan area are reportedly gathering in Youngdungpo.”<br/><br/>Although it had not been officially announced yet, the news that the formation of the metropolitan area alliance with the Liberation Guild as the center was spreading widely, so the news was emerging as the biggest issue in the community.<br/><br/>Maybe the Liberation Guild leadership was intentionally spreading such rumors as part of “viral marketing.”<br/><br/>‘The players who have survived so far definitely have the ability to save their own lives.’<br/><br/>Therefore, if they joined the alliance, they would be a great help, so the Liberation Guild was attracting as many players as possible and growing in size.<br/><br/>Of course, how to unify the rough and undisciplined survivors was the next question.<br/><br/>It was necessary for them to find the leader for that purpose.<br/><br/>“Now, second news. This is a secret message from Kyungsu. He said that the average level of people in Suwon village is close to 8. Great! They are looking forward to achieving it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Wow! They must have worked hard. Kyungsu also boasts that he has reached level 11 today.”<br/><br/>Kyungsu and Inho in the Suwon area were also doing well. Just like they promised to Sungwoo, they were raising the average level of the survivors there quickly.<br/><br/>“Come to think of it, they are growing very fast. I’m only level 14, even though I fought next to you for a long time, Sungwoo.”<br/><br/>Through the mini-game, Hanho increased by two levels. Jisu also reached level 16, which ranked her 6th in the Korea server rankings. Given that Yun Cho, level 16, was No. 5, she was about to jump to the top five.<br/><br/>“Hanho, have you ever rolled on the ground?” Sungwoo asked when he boasted.<br/><br/>“Well, I performed very well when you were not with me. Even today, I plucked grass and herbs and covered my body with them before fighting.”<br/><br/>“Why did you pluck grass? Did the strongest thief assassin weed?”<br/><br/>Hanho tapped his chest as if he was frustrated and angry.<br/><br/>“What I mean is I used a fantastic strategy to beat the enemy. Do you think I’m just a community announcer? I’m the icon of children here. You don’t know anything about it, right?”<br/><br/>“Oh, really?”<br/><br/>“Besides, I’ve leveled up this time and learned the ‘sneaking’ skill! In other words, I’m becoming the strongest thief!”<br/><br/>“Great!”<br/><br/>“Yeah, sneaking is so important… Oh, here is the third news. Our great Necromancer has achieved level 19, so he is the same rank as Kangsok Han, No. 1 in the Korean server…”<br/><br/>Hanho suddenly stopped talking, then looked at Sungwoo with a smile.<br/><br/>“It seems he has achieved the same rank as Han, but unfortunately, an hour ago, Han reached level 20. Our Necromancer needs to be a little more diligent!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s eyebrows wriggled, but Hanho was all smiles.<br/><br/>“Wow, awesome! Who is he? According to the community rumors, there was a man who smashed the Kobold army alone, who occupied the Sejong area! Could he be Kangsok Han? I’m really curious!”<br/><br/>Having said that, Hanho continued, tilting his head, “But aren’t you really curious? What the hell is he doing? Sungwoo, you’re taking all the undead with you and smashing large enemies easily, but who is this guy?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo himself couldn’t figure out what kind of job Kangsok had. He had never appeared in the community, and there was nobody who saw him.<br/><br/>“It seems that the warlord monsters in other regions were all destroyed. Of course, they did it a bit later than us, but they did a great job.”<br/><br/>“Those who could not hold out must have been killed.”<br/><br/>The warlord monster’s attack was fatal. Perhaps weak players among the survivors were killed. Only those who survived could move to the next level, which was more difficult. That was the game.<br/><br/>“Damn it. They have no love for humanity anyway.” Hanho whispered, turning his head. “Well, how can I expect this guy who collects dirty and smelly bones to have a love for humans? Ah, except for Orun.”<br/><br/>Then, he looked into the green eyes of the skeleton sitting next to him.<br/><br/>“Sorry, you’re an exception, sir.”<br/><br/>It was Minsok, the Death Knight. He gazed at Hanho’s cell phone, holding his sword. “Hanho, is there anything unusual in Youngdungpo?” asked Minsok.<br/><br/>“Well, it’s safe. Oh, I see. You said your family was there, right?”<br/><br/>“Yes. It doesn’t matter that I turned into a skeleton like this, but I didn’t know it would be really annoying not to be able to use a cell phone like a human.”<br/><br/>When he became a Death Knight, he was disqualified as a player, so he could not use the community.<br/><br/>“If I hear anything unusual, I’ll let you know right away. Don’t worry. I am the best in this field.”<br/><br/>“Sure. I hope I’m in your great hands.”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jisu sat on the ground and checked her three swords.<br/><br/>“Hey, sis, I have never seen that sword!”<br/><br/>In fact, she had another sword in addition to her two swords.<br/><br/>“Right. I got it today.”<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Genuine Silver Sword.<br/><br/>-Class: Hero<br/><br/>-Category: Sword<br/><br/>-Effect: It can break magic.<br/><br/>-Description: A sword forged with ‘genuine silver’, a rare magic metal. It is very light and hard. It also generates a unique wavelength in response to mana, through which it can destroy magic.<br/><br/>It was the loot she obtained after killing Huei. At first glance, the shiny silver blade looked luxurious.<br/><br/>“Wow, when can I get a weapon like that?”<br/><br/>While cleaning the newly-obtained sword, she seemed very satisfied.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The next day, the sky shook loudly early in the morning,<br/><br/>Dudududududududu―<br/><br/>“What the heck is that? Helicopter?”<br/><br/>Hanho woke up, rubbing his eyes. Sungwoo and Jisu were already walking outside.<br/><br/>A red helicopter landed on the Dolmen Gym square. It was a firefighting helicopter from Youngdungpo.<br/><br/>Minhum got off the helicopter and said, “Sungwoo, I heard the news that you have defeated the pirates. You are awesome!”<br/><br/>“Thank you, but you must have a reason for coming here so early in the morning?”<br/><br/>Minhum nodded and said, “Something unexpected happened.”<br/><br/>He then sighed and opened his mouth again.<br/><br/>“Kangsok Han, No. 1 in the rankings, appeared.”<br/><br/>Did the No.1 guy appear? Hasn’t he left no traces until now?<br/><br/>“Does you mean he has come to Youngdungpo?”<br/><br/>“Yes,” he said with an embarrassed expression. In fact, he had to absorb those in the vicinity of Youngdungpo to form a large group, but at this crucial time, Kangsok appeared suddenly, who was much stronger than their current leader Junghoon, the master of the Liberation Guild, which should be the central base of the new alliance. Since the guy who has been unknown until now appeared, he naturally drew the attention of everyone in Youngdungpo.<br/><br/>Raising his glasses, Minhum continued, “He said he wants to meet the Necromancer, Sungwoo.”<br/><br/>“Me?”<br/><br/>“That’s right. He said he wanted to talk with you about a very important issue that would determine the fate of the Korean peninsula. Damn it. He said he wouldn’t tell us. He said he wouldn’t tell us anything until the Necromancer comes.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t know what was going on, but obviously, Kangsok was confident enough to openly alienate the largest forces on the Korean peninsula, namely Junghoon’s group.<br/><br/>“Got it. Tell him to wait.”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>Minhum looked surprised at his reply. Tell him to wait? Right now, nobody knew what the No. 1 guy would do.<br/><br/>“Because I have to manufacture something and enhance something, I have to stop by the forge.”<br/><br/>“Oh, don’t you think it will make the situation worse?”<br/><br/>Obviously, there was confusion and anxiety spreading on his face.<br/><br/>“Minhum, if you just try to accept his demands just because he is the No. 1 guy, how do those who try to unite under the name of the alliance feel? If you want to show them you’re the central force, not him, you should show your power clearly.”<br/><br/>“Ah, that’s right, but…”<br/><br/>“Then tell him to wait.”<br/><br/>“Ah, got it.”<br/><br/>Minhum was very anxious. He felt like it was the night before the storm.<br/><br/>It seemed that these two mighty guys might confront each other in this crucial situation.<br/><br/>‘Man, we might suffer a side blow in the fight.’<br/><br/>Compared to the two giants, the emerging alliance was a small fry. </div><h2 id="chapter155">Chapter 155</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Sungwoo stood in front of the golden hammer-shaped icon. He was inside a cafe in downtown Kanghwa Island. As expected, there was a combination table in front of the counter.<br/><br/>When he approached it, a message appeared.<br/><br/>[Item production/combination]<br/><br/>-There are items that you can combine.<br/><br/>* Required cost: 1,500,000 gold (not enough medium)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shadow King’s Robe (Material) + Drake’s Leather (Material) = ???<br/><br/>* Required cost: 2,000,000 gold (not enough medium)<br/><br/>There were two items in total. It seemed that Sungwoo could enhance both of them to enhance equipment items with the materials he obtained by hunting Drake during the Youido Raid, but this time, it was more expensive because he had no medium such as the ‘Elder Slime Core’.<br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled out two material items.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Drake’s Leather<br/><br/>-Class: Hero<br/><br/>-Category: Production material<br/><br/>-Description: This is a young Black Drake’s scales. The quality itself is not good because it has not yet fully grown, but it is still strong enough.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Dragon Race’s Heart (Lower level)<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: Production material<br/><br/>-Description: The heart of a dragon is quite different from that of a trifling creature. It is an item that you should treat valuably.<br/><br/>“Man, I can use this at last.”<br/><br/>It’s been a while since he obtained it, but he didn’t have time to stop by a forge.<br/><br/>So, he put the ‘Repeating Crossbow’ and the ‘Dragon Race’s Heart (lower level)’ on the enhancement table.<br/><br/>-You have to pay (1,500,000) and there is a probability of damage (3%). Do you want to proceed?<br/><br/>“Go ahead.”<br/><br/>-Their combination is in progress. Please step back from the table for safety.<br/><br/>Wuuuuuuuuung!<br/><br/>The shape of the dragon race’s heart crumbled as if it evaporated, then it began to be sucked into the repeating crossbow.<br/><br/>-Their combination is complete.<br/><br/>It didn’t seem that its appearance changed, but red energy radiated from its body.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Repeating Crossbow-Flame<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: Crossbow<br/><br/>-Effect: Increases damage by itself (+20%), and a magazine connected to the armory in the subspace is loaded. (It can be fired without loading.) If you inject mana, you can use the ‘fire arrow’ function for one minute.<br/><br/>There were many changes in item information. Then, Sungwoo pulled out a small stone.<br/><br/>“Oh, yes, I’ve forgotten this!”<br/><br/>It was a ‘C-grade equipment enhancement stone’. He chose this item as a reward at the golden dungeon, but he had no opportunity to use it because he hadn’t stopped by a forge.<br/><br/>Sungwoo put the enhancement stone next to the repeating crossbow. Then, a message appeared.<br/><br/>-You have to pay (1,000), and a probability of damage (5%). Do you want to proceed?<br/><br/>“Go ahead.”<br/><br/>Wuuuuuuuuuung!<br/><br/>-Its combination is complete.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Repeating Crossbow-Flame (+2)<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: Crossbow<br/><br/>-Effect: Increased agility (+3), increased damage by itself (+30%), a magazine connected to the armory in the subspace. (It can be fired without loading.) If you inject mana, you can use the ‘fire arrow’ function for one minute.<br/><br/>“It’s okay.”<br/><br/>Since it was a weapon with a very fast rate of fire, it would bring about a huge increase in damage. If Sungwoo obtained the effect of a shadow alter ego, he would be able to destroy even a large number of enemies.<br/><br/>Finally, he combined the shadow King’s Robe’ and ‘Drake’s Leather.’ It was a success.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Shadow King’s Robe-Dragon Scale<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: Coat<br/><br/>-Effect: Magic Damage Reduction (-10%), Flame Immunity Increase (+30%), Self Defense Increase (+50%) You can hide when you are in shadow. (When attacking an opponent, you will appear, but you can be detected by detection skills.)<br/><br/>Two options were added, and as expected, there was no change in design. However, Drake’s leather was on the robe lining.<br/><br/>After he was done combining items, Sungwoo uploaded a profile.<br/><br/>[Player Profile]<br/><br/>-Name: Sungwoo Yu<br/><br/>-Level: 19<br/><br/>-Job: Necromancer, Black Wizard<br/><br/>-Ability: Strength (21+9), Agility (15+9), Stamina (14+7)<br/><br/>-Gold reserve: 27,855,400<br/><br/>-Trait: Chaos<br/><br/>-Maximum number of subordinate spirits: 17<br/><br/>Before he met with Kangsok Han, the No. 1 on the Korean server, Sungwoo obtained maximum stats.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Doodoodoo!<br/><br/>When the helicopter carrying Sungwoo and Minhum entered Youngudngpo, three magical drones approached it. The drone filmed the inside of the helicopter to check its occupants, and it also served as an escort by monitoring the surrounding situation closely.<br/><br/>“Wow, this is great!” Hanho said with admiration.<br/><br/>Like he said, Youngdungpo, as seen from the sky, had changed a lot. The outer walls that collapsed after the Evolution Society’s terrorism had been repaired completely. Given the translucent protective film protruding from the entrance of the building, it seemed that there were several ‘safety zones’ operating all the time.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there were a total of 16 guard posts in all directions, and each guard post had two gunners on duty.<br/><br/>“You’re right. I feel they are full of determination not to allow any attack. There are multiple layers of security around the building.”<br/><br/>That wasn’t the end. There was an ‘outside fence’ outside the ‘inner fence’ surrounding Youngdungpo Station, so those groups who came to join the coalition were staying in the shopping district around the station. They also dispatched their guards on the rooftop and watched the surroundings.<br/><br/>Minhum added, “A whopping 6,000 people came in droves in just a few days. In some cases, they came here in groups, but most of them came individually. So, when we form an alliance, many more people will come.”<br/><br/>There were about 30,000 survivors in Youngdungpo before the attack, but Junghoon said it was rather difficult for him to take care of them.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo could not be sure how many survivors would come when more alliances were formed after a successful negotiation.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it was clear why Junghoon was attracting more and more people because the huge population would be a tremendous power for him when he established the foundation.<br/><br/>“Do you see that over there?”<br/><br/>When the helicopter’s altitude lowered, Minhum pointed at the end of the road.<br/><br/>There were several military helicopters and dozens of blue tents around them.<br/><br/>“Those guys over there are a big headache. They are called the Reconstruction Alliance.<br/><br/>“Are they soldiers?”<br/><br/>“Well, not all of them. They are players from Uijeongbu and Namyangju, but I hear some of them are from the military. So, it seems that they have quite a bit of military equipment. With those weapons, they were apparently in the process of integrating the northern forces of Kyonggi Province. They are a very big force in that area, so they are not obedient,” said Minhum in an annoyed voice.<br/><br/>He continued, “To say the least, they are disturbing our activities. We keep noticing they’re involved in something that really bothers us.”<br/><br/>He also said that they seemed to be trying to induce a war of nerves with the Liberation Guild for some kind of political operation, so much so that they were trying to stop the Liberation Guild from becoming a bigger force than they were now.<br/><br/>“We have noticed their spies checking our movement secretly and reporting to their bosses several times.”<br/><br/>“Have they already started to hold you in check?”<br/><br/>“I guess so. I am concerned that just like in medieval times, we might fight each other through something like political operation and veiled enmity.”<br/><br/>Like Minhum said, if the Reconstruction Alliance decided to maintain their power, they would not like the creation of a united alliance of the survivors, so they would likely stand in the way by pretending to join the alliance.<br/><br/>Wuuuuuuuuuuung!<br/><br/>Soon, the helicopter landed. The new landing area on the boulevard had been expanded because some groups in remote places used planes.<br/><br/>Two Crusader members were on the ground to welcome them.<br/><br/>“Welcome!”<br/><br/>“Our Commander is waiting for you.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Minhum headed to the conference hall inside Youngdungpo Station. He said that Junghoon was waiting there.<br/><br/>When they arrived on the second floor where the conference hall was located, there was a disturbance at the end of the hallway. </div><h2 id="chapter156">Chapter 156</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>“Hey, let us meet the No. 1 guy!”<br/><br/>“Do you think this is a big deal? Nope, it’s not. Why are you stopping us from meeting him? Is the No. 1 guy the President of Korea? Do you think your Commander is like the Premier? Step aside, so I can directly ask to see him!”<br/><br/>Five men were screaming into the conference room from the hallway. The Crusader Team members were blocking them, but they seemed to be very embarrassed.<br/><br/>“Deputy Commander!”<br/><br/>The crew members found Minhum approaching from behind. Then, they felt relieved because they knew he would take care of this troublesome headache.<br/><br/>“Hey, guys, what’s going on?”<br/><br/>The five guys turned to him immediately.<br/><br/>“You got here at the right time. Deputy Commander, you shouldn’t block player-to-player communication in this way!”<br/><br/>“That is why we are asking for an equal decision council and opposing the policy on the coalition operating cost. Are you really trying to pursue dictatorship?”<br/><br/>When he heard that provocative word ‘dictatorship,’ Minhum responded in an angry tone, “Watch your language! Who is a dictator? Who is controlling you? Kangsok Han himself has made it clear that he would not meet anybody. Why are you trying to pick a fight with us? We also can’t talk with him because he is refusing it.”<br/><br/>But the man who ground his nerves retorted, “Don’t make excuses like that. Do you think we don’t know you guys are monopolizing the position of No. 1 even after winning over the Necromancer? We know you sweet-talked the Necromancer into fighting the Chinese players, then reaped the sweet outcomes comfortably.”<br/><br/>When he said that, Sungwoo stepped forward and said, “Who is fighting whom?”<br/><br/>The man remained silent when Sungwoo appeared before him.<br/><br/>“Necromancer?”<br/><br/>“What the heck? When did you come?”<br/><br/>Some of them looked quite embarrassed because they did not expect him to appear here at all. One of them even stepped back as if he was shocked.<br/><br/>The images of the Necromancer as they saw through the media were so impressive that he was considered as a hero and an overwhelming power.<br/><br/>“Necromancer, I never expected you would be here.”<br/><br/>However, the three tall and heavy guys who stood before him were not moved at all.<br/><br/>As if they were from the same organization, they were wearing a green eagle-shaped badge on their left chest. And they were looking at Sungwoo’s eyes keenly as if they were waging a war of nerves with him.<br/><br/>“I’ve joined this group on my own. I’m not controlled by anybody,” said Sungwoo firmly.<br/><br/>Then one of the three men, who was wearing rimless glasses, sneered at him and said, “Don’t you think you’re mistaken?”<br/><br/>“Mistaken?”<br/><br/>Now, they were openly challenging Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Well, what I mean is you might be mistaken that you are acting on your own? You might be playing into their hands. So, please give serious thought to it.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo laughed it off, then said, “Thank you for the advice. Let me tell you this. Just think carefully before you say something. You might be mistaken if you think you can get away with murder even if you shoot your mouth off these days,”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo gave them a clear warning.<br/><br/>The one who stepped back at his words moved back further. The guy wearing rimless glasses shut up. Then, he passed by Sungwoo, frowning at him. The other guys followed him hurriedly.<br/><br/>One of them shouted, “We’re not pushovers! Don’t underestimate us.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo ignored them, and they disappeared down the stairs.<br/><br/>Minhum said, “They are the nasty guys I mentioned to you.”<br/><br/>“You mean they’re the members of the Reconstruction Alliance?”<br/><br/>“Yes. I hear they have their own leader, but we don’t know his identity.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo calmly nodded and said, “When you form a coalition, you should check them carefully. You don’t know who is approaching for what purpose.”<br/><br/>“That’s right. We are extremely careful at the moment because people with the Evolution Society might infiltrate our alliance. The Wide Area Surveillance Team, which we founded recently, is doing their job well.”<br/><br/>It was the intelligence unit they founded at Sungwoo’s recommendation.<br/><br/>Minhum opened the door of the conference room. All kinds of documents were piled up like a mountain on the spacious desk in the conference room.<br/><br/>Junghoon raised his head. He was taking off his full body armor at the moment, but he looked pretty haggard.<br/><br/>“Oh, you are here.”<br/><br/>“You look tired.”<br/><br/>“Well, I was reading some stuff before you got here. By the way, as you guaranteed, you defeated the pirates. Thank you.”<br/><br/>“Because I promised.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo sat across from him. Jungwoo looked nervous.<br/><br/>“I would like to ask you a lot of questions about the Chinese server, but there is someone who you need to talk to first.”<br/><br/>“You mean Kangsok Han?”<br/><br/>“Yes. Ranking No.1, Kangsok Han.”<br/><br/>Junghoon looked more gloomy while mentioning his name.<br/><br/>“I can’t find out his real identity. Besides, he said he came here to discuss something that could influence the fate of the Korean peninsula. So, I just don’t know what will happen.”<br/><br/>“I heard he was looking for me.”<br/><br/>“Yes. By the way, Sungwoo, that guy is really different. Yes, completely different from us. So, I’m not sure what will happen.”<br/><br/>Junghoon stood up from his seat and said, “As this is an important issue, I hope that you can meet and talk to him. If this is something that can influence the Korean peninsula, it’s very urgent.”<br/><br/>Junghoon was clearly frustrated. Even though he was the leader of this group, Kangsok Han refused to talk with him.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Junghoon tried to find a rational answer. So, he thought that it was the best answer to arrange for a meeting between the two.<br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/>Junghoon immediately escorted Sungwoo to the place where Kangsok was staying.<br/><br/>Their destination was the VIP lounge, the most antique place in the department store building at Youngdungpo Station. When Sungwoo got closer, an ominous message appeared.<br/><br/>-An unknown energy is encroaching on the whole area.<br/><br/>“What the heck…”<br/><br/>Junghoon, walking ahead, nodded at Sungwoo and said, “Can you see it? I don’t know what this is.”<br/><br/>-Your body function is deteriorating due to unknown energy.<br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-1)<br/><br/>The closer they got to that place, the worse their symptoms got.<br/><br/>-Your body function is deteriorating due to unknown energy.<br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-2)<br/><br/>“Right here!” Junghoon said in a small voice and opened the door of the VIP Lounge.<br/><br/>Then, the first thing that caught his eye was a roll cake on the wooden table. And next to the cake, something very small was eating the cake.<br/><br/>“Sweet! Sweet!”<br/><br/>It was a very small woman. Her back had four silver wings, and her long blue hair was impressive.<br/><br/>‘Tinkerbell? Or a fairy?’<br/><br/>No matter how closely he looked at her, she was clearly a fairy. She poked the teaspoon into the roll cake, turned her head to Sungwoo, then flew away.<br/><br/>“What the heck! Is the guest already here?”<br/><br/>“Where is Mr. Kangsok Han?”<br/><br/>When Junghoon asked, the fairy swallowed the piece of cake in her mouth, then flew somewhere.<br/><br/>“Wait a minute!”<br/><br/>There was another door inside the lounge. The fairy started tapping the door with her tiny fist.<br/><br/>“Kangsok! Kangsok! You have a guest here!”<br/><br/>Then, there was the sound of somebody stepping forward inside the door.<br/><br/>-Your body function is deteriorating due to unknown energy.<br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-3)<br/><br/>It meant they were getting closer to Kangsok.<br/><br/>Soon, the door opened.<br/><br/>-Your body function is deteriorating due to unknown energy.<br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-4)<br/><br/>A man in a black shirt appeared. At a glance, he was somewhat different from a typical man.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether he was handsome or not, there was some kind of halo around his body.<br/><br/>Was it because of his mood? Or was it because of the system?<br/><br/>The message that came out next was even more shocking.<br/><br/>-You are facing a man with godly stature.<br/><br/>* Since you are fully qualified, you can face the man with godly stature.<br/><br/>‘Godly stature?’<br/><br/>-The power of ‘Demigod’ suppresses your strength.<br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-5)<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not help but be embarrassed. Demigod meant a semi-god or half-god.<br/><br/>In other words, it meant that he was similar to a god.<br/><br/>“Necromancer, you have just found my identity, right?” Kangsok smiled faintly, but Sungwoo didn’t say anything.<br/><br/>‘No. 1 guy is a god?”<br/><br/>Of course, Sungwoo didn’t take it at face value.<br/><br/>‘Is he 6 stars then?’<br/><br/>If he wasn’t a real god, it meant that he exceeded certain conditions within the system. Something more than 5 stars.<br/><br/>Whatever it was, an unexpected situation was unfolding at the moment. </div><h2 id="chapter157">Chapter 157</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Kangsok Han, No. 1 on the Korean server rankings, was in his mid-to-late thirties. He looked like a prince.<br/><br/>It may be the effect of his ‘godly stature,’ but somehow it looked like he had a halo around his head. Sungwoo felt mystified and in awe of this strange man.<br/><br/>‘What the heck is a demigod? Is it a job? Or something else?’<br/><br/>After introducing the two, Junghoon went outside because Kangsok wanted to talk with Sungwoo alone.<br/><br/>In such a spacious VIP lounge only Sungwoo, Kangsok, and the fairy stayed.<br/><br/>“Coke? Or soda? It’s not my home, but now I’ve rented it, so let me treat you,” said Kangsok.<br/><br/>He opened the bar’s refrigerator.<br/><br/>“Give me water. That’s enough.”<br/><br/>“I want soda!” shouted the fairy while chewing roll cake.<br/><br/>Kangsok quietly took out a bottle of water and soda, then poured the soda into an espresso glass. Then, he put a sip stick, commonly called a coffee straw, and placed it next to the roll cake.<br/><br/>“Thanks!”<br/><br/>“Eat a little. Don’t overeat like you did last time. You can’t fly!”<br/><br/>“It’s too late!”<br/><br/>Kangsok sat face to face with Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“The best necromancer on the Korean server…”<br/><br/>Kangsok opened the water bottle and handed it to Sungwoo. When he rose, his shirt sleeves rose and the bracelet on his wrist was revealed.<br/><br/>Eyeball-shaped red gems glistened on a black metal chain. A total of five rings were worn on his hands. Each of them was high grade. Sungwoo realized that the equipment items he was wearing were gorgeous even though he was not armed.<br/><br/>“Thank you for seeing me like this when you’re busy. I was impressed by your fighting in Youido. Nabi liked that fight very much. Oh, her name is Nabi.”<br/><br/>“Wow, you are the man who fought there! Your battle in Youido was really great! Can you give me a ride on Bone Drake later?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at the fairy flapping her small wings, Nabi, then asked Kangsok, “Is that an item?”<br/><br/>“What the heck? Item? Are you talking about me?”<br/><br/>Kangsok nodded with a smile.<br/><br/>“Oh, that’s right. She’s an item. Have you played something like Tamagotchis? If you give cake and soda to her, her happiness will increase. You feel happy and satisfied while seeing her. It’s great for preventing depression.”<br/><br/>“Hey! How can you call me an item! You shouldn’t do that. Without me, you would have to talk to yourself all day long, right?”<br/><br/>“That’s why I said you are good for preventing depression.”<br/><br/>The fairy screamed like crazy, swinging the teaspoon, but the little voice from that small figure drew their attention.<br/><br/>Sungwoo said, “I heard that something is coming that will determine the fate of this land.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo got down to the point right away, and Kangsok nodded.<br/><br/>It was a very profound subject, but he looked relaxed. He picked up a can of soda and turned his head to look at Nabi.<br/><br/>“Yeah, I got a prophetic stone and got to see it. I think it was Bad Ending-15. Oh, you know what a prophetic stone is, right?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded.<br/><br/>Bad Ending meant the end of this land. The ‘Korean Server Bad Ending-2’, which Junghoon had shown Sungwoo, showed the scenes of the world tree raised in Youido flooding and encroaching on the entire Korean peninsula.<br/><br/>“Interestingly, in some prophetic stones, reading a prophecy is also the starting point of that prophecy. I found that prophetic stone; then, the prophecy began to come true.”<br/><br/>Kangsok continued, putting down the soda can, “The dungeon called Hell’s Gate has opened. It was a level of 27, and its level of difficulty came with a party play recommendation. Appropriate level 27? Honestly, I didn’t have a problem, but party play was a problem.”<br/><br/>Then, he took out a stone of a familiar shape. It was a ‘prophecy’.<br/><br/>“Seeing is believing, right?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded and accepted the prophetic stone. As expected, the video was played.<br/><br/>-You contacted ‘a prophetic stone (Korean Server Bad Ending-15)’.<br/><br/>The world was engulfed in darkness. Somewhere there was an eerie whispering. The voices of old men, women, and children were mixed, so they could not be understood.<br/><br/>“The door… opens.”<br/><br/>As soon as some words were heard, the ruined city came into view.<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t know where it was. In the meantime, there was a giant corpse that could not be recognized. It looked like a large monster, but someone appeared in front of it.<br/><br/>“Kangsok! Look over there! A prophetic stone!”<br/><br/>“Yes, I saw it too.”<br/><br/>It was Kangsok Han and the fairy. They found something inside the monster’s body.<br/><br/>The moment he reached out and picked up the prophetic stone, something happened.<br/><br/>-‘Hell’s Gate (1st floor)’ opened.<br/><br/>The prophetic stone was split into two and flew into the sky like a firecracker. Then, they flew in opposite directions.<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s eyes followed the fragments of the stone. It flew for a long time before falling at a great distance. Soon, a huge portal opened.<br/><br/>‘It is Hell’s Gate.’<br/><br/>In two distant places, the ‘Hell’s Gate (1st floor)’ was opened. Something appeared inside the gate.<br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/>It was a burning armor of enormous size. All sorts of bizarre patterns were engraved on the dark gray plate.<br/><br/>Thump- Thump-<br/><br/>Every time the monster stepped forward, flames soared above his footsteps, and everything around him was scorched as he moved. His presence was slowly killing this world.<br/><br/>Well, that wasn’t the end.<br/><br/>Gruuuuuuuuuuu-<br/><br/>Like maggots on a corpse, black dogs whisked and rose from the ashes.<br/><br/>From then on, the scenes of the future continued. Two “Hell Moving Armors” marched in different directions, burning everything on the ground.<br/><br/>The black dogs woke up in the ashes, grew in number, and spread across the country.<br/><br/>The whole area of Seoul started to boil, and the water in Sokchon Lake was completely dry.<br/><br/>The huge flames that burnt down the metropolitan area climbed Mt. Taebaek and encroached on the east coast.<br/><br/>That way, the entire Korean server turned red. The sky over the Korean Peninsula was filled with black smoke.<br/><br/>-This is the future you will face if you cannot stop the “Hell Moving Armor” from hell.<br/><br/>*’Hell Moving Armor’ absorbs the energy of the earth as time goes by and emits a stronger flame.<br/><br/>“Did you see it all?”<br/><br/>“Yep.”<br/><br/>“I think they are anxious to destroy the land of Korea in this game.”<br/><br/>Kangsok went on to say that he confronted a lot of powerful monsters he had never experienced before, but he said he could hunt them without difficulty.<br/><br/>The problem was why they recommended ‘party play’. As they witnessed in the video, the “Hell Moving Armors” that appeared in two places kept reviving unless they were eliminated simultaneously within a certain amount of time.<br/><br/>“But I’m a solo player.”<br/><br/>That’s why he came to see the Necromancer because he felt that the only player who could deal with the difficulty of the appropriate level 27, was the Necromancer, except for himself. “Anyway, those two are constantly going north. And they are getting stronger and stronger. In a few weeks, they will reach this place, Youngdungpo, and soon destroy the entire Korean peninsula.”<br/><br/>Just to think of that possibility made Sungwoo shudder.<br/><br/>“And if it’s not me, there’s almost no player who can hunt them. Well, I could just leave this land, but let me help you, so let’s get rid of them before they become stronger, then let’s divide the reward in half.”<br/><br/>When Kangsok said that, Sungwoo raised his head and saw him face to face because he was very embarrassed by his words.<br/><br/>‘Help me? Do you think you are not responsible for this?’<br/><br/>Since monsters popped up when he got the prophetic stone, it was rather difficult for Sungwoo to blame him, but Sungwoo thought he should feel guilty, to say the least.<br/><br/>Then, Kangsok offered to help him as if he showed Sungwoo mercy.<br/><br/>‘This guy has not come to see me to ask me a favor.’<br/><br/>Obviously, he came here to make the demands for troops to help him hunt by taking the crisis of Youngdungpo as his leverage. Although he looked gentlemanly, there was some brazenness behind it.<br/><br/>But at this moment, it wasn’t his attitude that Sungwoo had to pay attention to.<br/><br/>“What is the reward?”<br/><br/>Kangsok put his head forward with a smile.<br/><br/>“Legendary grade items”<br/><br/>In Sungwoo’s opinion, what he could get was important. And if he could get legendary grade items with certainty, his offer was worth considering.<br/><br/>But Sungwoo asked curiously, “Isn’t the reward just one?”<br/><br/>Kangsok said, smiling mischievously, “That’s right. One of us will have it. I can’t help it, but how about playing a game with me?”<br/><br/>He reached out his hand.<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo could know that this guy was enjoying this hellish world.<br/><br/>“Are you not confident?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo held his hands.<br/><br/>So, the No.1 and No. 2 on the Korean servers agreed to have a duel. </div><h2 id="chapter158">Chapter 158</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>“That’s true. When I dispatched the Wide Area Surveillance Team to confirm it, they confirmed a group of monsters driving flames in the Pyongtaek and Ansung areas.”<br/><br/>Minhum reported to Junghoon and Sungwoo.<br/><br/>After Sungwoo relayed the news to them, they confirmed it in four hours thanks to the Wide Area Surveillance Team composed of bandits and wizards. The group was formed urgently when Sungwoo emphasized the necessity of an intelligence agency. The agency was growing into an organization capable of gathering intelligence in all the areas including the metropolitan region.<br/><br/>“The boss monster is a 4-meter armor type monster called ‘Hell Moving Armor.’ And there are dozens of ‘Hell Hounds’ around it. In addition, they are notorious for burning all the roads they pass into ashes. I’m afraid they will do us great harm.”<br/><br/>Behind Minhum appeared a screenshot from a magic drone on the screen. It seemed to be the city center of the southern part of Kyonggi Province, but huge flames engulfed the whole area as if a big fire had broken out there.<br/><br/>Junghoon looked at Sungwoo, covering his chin with both hands.<br/><br/>“So, does it mean they are coming to Youngdungpo right now?”<br/><br/>“I can’t single out Youngdungpo, but as long as they are advancing north, it is inevitable for us to collide with them.”<br/><br/>It wasn’t clear how the twin ‘Hell Moving Armors’ were moving together, but the problem was they were burning everything on the ground while passing by. If that’s the case, not only Youngdungpo but also Suwon would be in a dangerous situation.<br/><br/>“Man, we were done stopping the Chinese pirates; now, we’re faced with the monster in armor from hell. Did you accept Kangsok Han’s offer, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/>Kangsok suggested a game to Sungwoo. Namely, who was going to hunt the two ‘Hell Moving Armor’ fastest? The winner would get the reward.<br/><br/>Of course, Kangsok didn’t tell Junghoon about this, only saying he asked for Sungwoo’s cooperation.<br/><br/>Sungwoo said, “Well, that guy suggested we leave today. I guess we shouldn’t be late. According to him, they are becoming stronger as time goes by.”<br/><br/>“Then, by the time they arrive at Youngdungpo, they will be much stronger than now, right?”<br/><br/>“I guess so. So, we have to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Oh, just in case, can you take some measures to evacuate the players in Suwon?”<br/><br/>“Of course. Let me help you with that matter.”<br/><br/>In fact, Junghoon felt frustrated with the fact that he had to rely on the Necromancer and take care of the people left behind, but he felt he had to put up with this for the sake of a great cause.<br/><br/>‘The most important thing is the establishment of a coalition. I should put this ahead of all else. When I establish the coalition, I’ll be in a better position.”<br/><br/>In a difficult situation like this, the Necromancer was like a breakwater for the establishment of the coalition. Without him, it would have taken Junghoon much longer to achieve his goal.<br/><br/>‘That’s why I have to support Sungwoo right now.’<br/><br/>At that moment, the door opened, and one of his crew members came in.<br/><br/>He relayed new information from the Wide Area Surveillance Team.<br/><br/>Minhum checked it and said, “We have confirmed their route. As expected, they are destroying the places where player groups are staying.”<br/><br/>Literally, they were hunting humans everywhere while coming north. It was now clear that the survivors’ village in Suwon was in a dangerous situation.<br/><br/>“Junghoon, you need to be prepared for their attack,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“If we fail to stop them, we have to make a plan to escape to Kanghwa Island.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded at him.<br/><br/>If the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the Korean Server failed to stop the twin monsters, it was logically impossible for anybody to stop them.<br/><br/>So, they had to set up a contingency plan. Kanghwa Island looked like a good choice. Junghoon already thought about it.<br/><br/>“I think it’s about time we got rid of these parasites. I’ve been looking for a chance to get rid of those who were trying to do harm to us while pretending to be interested in joining our coalition, and I think this is the right time.”<br/><br/>In Sungwoo’s eyes, Junghoon referred to the Reconstruction Alliance.<br/><br/>“When this is over, we will form a new coalition.”<br/><br/>It wouldn’t be long before the birth of a huge organization that would fight against the hellish game.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Sungwoo went into the VIP lounge with Jisu and Hanho. Kangsok was also ready to leave.<br/><br/>He was wearing black ‘hard leather armor’ with a huge wooden cane. The head of the cane was shaped like a hawk. With a huge beak protruding, it seemed to act as a blunt instrument.<br/><br/>He looked at Sungwoo’s party and raised his eyebrows.<br/><br/>“Uh? I thought you were going alone. Let me tell you seriously. Your colleagues could be killed.”<br/><br/>Hanho looked at him, embarrassed by what he said, then asked, “Are they so dreadful?”<br/><br/>On the other hand, Jisu said confidently, “Well, there was always a high chance we would be killed, but we have survived on such occasions, and the odds of our survival have gone up.”<br/><br/>Kangsok said with a smile, “Okay, I’m going to move to Osan via teleport magic. Nabi has already secured a teleport point. Nabi, say hello.”<br/><br/>“This is Nabi!”<br/><br/>A blue-haired fairy, Nabi, appeared on his right shoulder. Hanho and Jisu looked at the fairy in admiration. In particular, Hanho opened his eyes and waved his hand.<br/><br/>“Oh, hi, Nabi!”<br/><br/>But Nabi turned her head with a sullen expression.<br/><br/>“Huh! Go away!”<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck? Why …”<br/><br/>“It stinks!”<br/><br/>“What the hell, what do you mean?”<br/><br/>But Nabi didn’t explain what she meant by that.<br/><br/>“Now, let’s move right away.”<br/><br/>“Good!”<br/><br/>When Kangsok said that, Nabi flew into the air. Then, she sprinkled her golden powder all over and held out her tiny hands over her head.<br/><br/>“We’re flying!”<br/><br/>-You have ‘teleported’ to the designated location. (Designated spot number 3)<br/><br/>Wuuuuuuuuuuung―<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>The next moment, they were standing on the Osan Station Railway. They moved from Youngdungpo to Osan Station in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>Hanho looked around with his mouth open. Sungwoo also admired it.<br/><br/>“Great item!”<br/><br/>“Right. Well, she is most happy after eating, and this is her second-best skill,” said Kangsok.<br/><br/>“What? I heard you!” Nabi complained.<br/><br/>“Now, you guys, move to Pyongtaek. Let me take care of Ansung. I have one more teleport point nearby, so I’m going to move there.”<br/><br/>Having said that, he held out something, which looked like pink petals.<br/><br/>“This is also one of Nabi’s skills. If you put this on your ear, you can communicate with each other in real-time.”<br/><br/>“You can’t take it off! If you take it off, it disappears!” said Nabi.<br/><br/>Sungwoo received one of the petals. When he brought it near his ear, it automatically stuck to it.<br/><br/>-You are connected to the fairy’s communication network’.<br/><br/>“Connected!”<br/><br/>“Well, good luck!”<br/><br/>Saying so, Kangsok struck his cane on the railroad. At that moment, bright light covered his body.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party stood on the railway and looked in the direction where Kangsok disappeared.<br/><br/>“Wow, the No. 1 on the Korean server is really different! How cool! But Nabi sucks!” Hanho said.<br/><br/>“As far as I see it, Orun is better than Nabi, Hanho. Orun is the best!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo silently summoned Bone Wyvern. Now, it was time for him to fly to move.<br/><br/>At that moment, Hanho looked gloomy.<br/><br/>“Man, I already begin to miss teleporting.”<br/><br/>After getting aboard Bone Wyvern, they flew straight in the direction of Pyongtaek.<br/><br/>Soon, they saw huge flames soaring downtown in the distance.<br/><br/>-It’s me, Nabi! Can you hear me?<br/><br/>Nabi’s voice came through the fairy communication network.<br/><br/>“I can hear you well.”<br/><br/>-Of course, you should! It’s my magic!<br/><br/>When they entered the outskirts of the city center, Jisu shouted, “Sungwoo! Look right under the big building!”<br/><br/>Looking down, Sungwoo saw a group of people near the five-story building. There were a total of seven. They were running to a bus about to start. Children and women were inside the bus. It seemed that they were evacuating north, to avoid the flames.<br/><br/>-Oh, I forgot to say something!<br/><br/>“They are being chased by Hellhounds!”<br/><br/>Three-meter long black dogs were running after the players.<br/><br/>They were the Hell Hounds, hellish watchman born out of the ashes. These monsters jumped a few meters and narrowed the distance in just one leap. The players were already exhausted, so it seemed the monsters would catch up with them and devour them.<br/><br/>-That armor summons the ‘Fire Giant,’ then throws it randomly. So, be careful when you fly in the sky!<br/><br/>“Uh? Sungwoo, look over there!” Hanho shouted.<br/><br/>Huge flames soared vertically between burning buildings, then they started to swirl and form something. Then, the vortex vanished.<br/><br/>“Well, what the heck is that?”<br/><br/>Black smoke rose from the spot, and a huge hand soared and touched the roof of the 7th floor. It raised its huge body. It was a ‘Fire Giant’ that was 20 meters tall.<br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrrrr ―<br/><br/>His burning eyes were fixed on Bone Wyvern flying low at the moment. The monster was too close to Bone Wyvern. Sungwoo quickly turned around.<br/><br/>At that moment, the monster grabbed the roof of the building, ripped it off, and threw it at Bone Wyvern. A lump of concrete engulfed in flames flew at great speed.<br/><br/>They could not avoid it.<br/><br/>“Hold tight!”<br/><br/>Puck! Kugugugguu!<br/><br/>The fireball hit the stomach of Bone Wyvern. A crack appeared in the body of Bone Wyvern, dividing him into two parts. The fragments were scattered in all directions.<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party fell to the ground, hanging on to the huge bones. They were in the middle of a hellish landscape surrounded by flames, including trees, buildings, and vehicles.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, look down!”<br/><br/>Dozens of Hellhounds began to pop out of the alley like a herd of rats and ran toward them.<br/><br/>“We’re falling!”<br/><br/>They fell into the inferno. </div><h2 id="chapter159">Chapter 159</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Bone Wyvern’s upper body was stuck in the middle of the road. Those riding on it couldn’t keep their balance after hitting the ground.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>But there was no time for them to recover.<br/><br/>“They’re rushing us!” shouted Jisu, staggering and standing from the pile of bones. She immediately took out the Silver Sword and watched her surroundings.<br/><br/>Bark! Bark!<br/><br/>In no time, a herd of Hell Hounds poured out of the alley. They were black dogs with red eyes. Instead of foam, they had red flames in their mouths, and black smoke was coming out of their nostrils.<br/><br/>Jisoo swung her sword, stepping forward. With the energy of the sharp blade, she cut the lead Hell Hound.<br/><br/>Kaaaaaaang!<br/><br/>However, the sword only made a deep wound on the Hell Hound’s neck. The dog was charging at her like crazy.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>At that time, a barrage of arrows was fired from behind her and got stuck into the dog’s body randomly. The dog leaned forward and hit a burning street tree.<br/><br/>-You have earned 10,550 gold by hunting ‘Hell Hound’.<br/><br/>It was Sungwoo’s repeating crossbow. Although his newly added ‘Ignition Arrow’ was not active, its sound of firing was louder, showing it could inflict more damage than before. In other words, it was powerful enough to stop such a monster.<br/><br/>Bark! Bark!<br/><br/>Jisu and Sungwoo killed only one dog. Then two more dogs rushed at them from behind.<br/><br/>“Let me take care of the dog on the left!” Jisu said.<br/><br/>She was dealing with the dog. Black smoke gathered on Sungwoo’s right side, then Death Knight, Minsok, appeared. He looked around and raised his sword.<br/><br/>“Oh my God… I think we should be on alert all the time!”<br/><br/>Moving forward, she swung her sword at the dog’s ankles, the weakest spot. The Hell Hound’s forelimb was amputated and her body tilted to one side. At that moment, Jisu disappeared.<br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/>Jisu appeared in front of the Hell Hound and stabbed her sword into the dog’s neck.<br/><br/>“Jisu, you have become much stronger. I have to fight harder!”<br/><br/>Minsok looked at her in admiration, then held out his left hand and unleashed the chains.<br/><br/>The moment the chains wrapped around the Hell Hound’s neck, he swung his shoulders to pull the dog’s neck, but the Hell Hound soared, and charged at him.<br/><br/>Minsok cut its neck in the air.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>In the meantime, Sungwoo fired the repeating crossbow at the Hell Hound running from behind. However, it was too much for him to deal with all the Hell Hounds charging from everywhere.<br/><br/>They closed in on him quickly.<br/><br/>“You have to escape quickly. Soon, the giant will come.”<br/><br/>That’s why Sungwoo didn’t summon more skeletons. There was no time for him to fight here any longer. The moment the Fire Giant came, everybody would be annihilated with the pile of burning concrete covering them.<br/><br/>‘I can’t waste my awakening time here.’<br/><br/>But Sungwoo could not summon the Grim Reaper because the real fight would begin when he faced the “Hell Moving Armor”. So, he had to save the available time of the Grim Reaper.<br/><br/>“The alley on the left is open!” Jisu shouted.<br/><br/>Firing the crossbow randomly, Sungwoo nodded. She stepped forward and entered the alley, securing the path of retreat. Minsok pulled Hanho out of the pile of bones and held him on his shoulder. Hanho had passed out due to the impact of the fall.<br/><br/>“Come on, let’s go!”<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuung-<br/><br/>A little later, a tremendous vibration rang beyond the building on the right, and the entire sky turned orange. Above the rooftop was the burning flames.<br/><br/>The ‘Fire Giant’ was approaching them. He was powerful enough to kill Bone Wyvern with one strike.<br/><br/>‘How can I kill the monster?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo would have to deal with that monster someday, but right now he needed to escape to a safe place and catch his breath.<br/><br/>Bark! Bark!<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party started to enter the alley on the left, holding back the herd of Hell Hounds. Sungwoo turned around after firing the repeating crossbow.<br/><br/>Thud-<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned a “troll skeleton” to block the alley to separate the chasing Hell Hounds from them.<br/><br/>Subordinate spirits like Bone Wyvern were difficult to obtain again, but Sungwoo had to give them up at this moment and retreat.<br/><br/>“Let’s get out of here while the skeleton is blocking them!”<br/><br/>Bark! Bark!<br/><br/>The Hell Hounds flocked into the narrow alley and collided with the troll skeleton. It seemed like the skeleton covered with bone armor could endure it for a while.<br/><br/>But the skeleton was engulfed in flames and crushed. Four Hell Hounds opened their snouts at the same time and spewed out flames, melting the troll skeleton.<br/><br/>“We’re open to their attack!”<br/><br/>The Hell Hound’s firepower was far more powerful than expected. Sungwoo immediately summoned two more troll skeletons to delay their attack.<br/><br/>“Run to the street!”<br/><br/>They came out on the big road and started running.<br/><br/>“Stop!” Minsok shouted. There was a red marble floating in the air in front of them.<br/><br/>Whoo-<br/><br/>Then, some sparks from somewhere flew around the object one by one, and the flames flowed in and condensed into one place. Then, a huge flame tornado arose.<br/><br/>Kugugugugugu-<br/><br/>The Fire Giant fragmented himself to fly to them.<br/><br/>“Man, that monster singled us out for attack!”<br/><br/>Minsok raised the sword and defended the forefront, but even though he was the powerful Death Knight, he couldn’t stop such a giant.<br/><br/>“We have to fight.”<br/><br/>It seemed that Sungwoo had to change the plan to fight against the monster after escaping to a safe place first because if they were hesitant here, frightened, they might be killed even before confronting the ‘Hell Moving Armor.’<br/><br/>“Damn it! I have no choice but to summon the undead.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned the undead.<br/><br/>Soon, troll skeletons and ghouls appeared and surrounded Sungwoo and his party.<br/><br/>Thump- Thump-<br/><br/>The Fire Giant, who regained his original figure and advanced along the boulevard.<br/><br/>Chiiiiiiiii<br/><br/>When he moved, his feet burned the asphalt and generated toxic gas. Then, his bulky body swayed without any certain shape and began to swallow the surrounding buildings.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>“Fire!”<br/><br/>There was screaming inside a building.<br/><br/>“There are people inside there.”<br/><br/>That was an unexpected scene. It seemed that they were the players Sungwoo and his party saw from the sky before the crash.<br/><br/>It seemed that they were hiding inside the building, but they were now in a dangerous situation because the Fire Giant came to this place to attack Sungwoo’s party.<br/><br/>“If they are not helped, they will be burned to death.”<br/><br/>Jisu did not hide the responsibility for that tragedy, but Sungwoo and his party could not afford to save them now.<br/><br/>“Dad! Dad!”<br/><br/>“Guys, step back!”<br/><br/>Children’s screams erupted inside the building. Sungwoo’s eyebrows wriggled.<br/><br/>This was something familiar to him.<br/><br/>A burning building, people screaming, and even him standing in front of them. This was something Sungwoo had seen before.<br/><br/>The moment he hesitated to act in front of the flames and finally gave up was similar to the moment when his family died in the fire.<br/><br/>Old memories rekindled his painful trauma.<br/><br/>Since he was so weak-minded back then, he did not have the courage to jump into the flames to save his family, so he survived alone.<br/><br/>But now he was different.<br/><br/>“Everyone, back off.”<br/><br/>Now, he can jump into the fire to save them.<br/><br/>Sungwoo put on the hood of the robe. Then he held out his right hand.<br/><br/>There the Grim Reaper appeared.<br/><br/>-You have summoned the killing scythe, ‘Grim Reaper’.<br/><br/>-Grim Reaper retention time (00:59:59)<br/><br/>“Please guard behind me.”<br/><br/>Green flames began to eat his body. Pure white bones were revealed and his green eyes lit up.<br/><br/>-You have gained the power of ‘Lich’.<br/><br/>* Increases maximum subordinate spirits (+50).<br/><br/>* All stats increase (+10).<br/><br/>* You can revive and regenerate nearby destroyed undead ‘indefinitely as much as the maximum number of your subordinate spirits’.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, are you okay?”<br/><br/>Of course, Sungwoo’s party trusted him, but the monster approaching them right now was quite different from the monsters they had seen before.<br/><br/>The Fire Giant was a whopping level 27 monster. So, everybody escaped without even trying to confront him.<br/><br/>“We have to check it out.”<br/><br/>Jisu turned backward because a herd of Hell Hounds literally started pouring out from the alley on the right.<br/><br/>Two-woong! Two-woong! </div><h2 id="chapter160">Chapter 160</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Now, the troll skeletons fired huge slingshots at the Hellhounds at random. Fist-sized stones were fired like bullets, knocking down the Hellhounds at the forefront.<br/><br/>After that, the ghouls started running and got into dogfights with the monster dogs.<br/><br/>The flames spewed by the Hellhounds were powerful, but they were not fatal anymore.<br/><br/>The charcoaled bodies of the ghouls recovered in an instant, stood up again, and cut off the Hellhounds’ heads.<br/><br/>“As things stand now, we can block them to some extent.”<br/><br/>As long as the effect of the killing scythe, Grim Reaper, was there, Sungwoo was in a more favorable situation because he could make this a war of attrition.<br/><br/>Thump- Thump-<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo had to find a way to deal with the Fire Giant coming closer to him.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>‘We can’t beat him with a simple attack .’<br/><br/>Since the monster’s body was made of flame, ordinary physical attacks would not work. Moreover, even a large skeleton would melt just by touching his flame body.<br/><br/>However, the Fire Giant had only one soft spot, namely his head. He had a skull that seemed to be made of stone.<br/><br/>‘Okay, that’s the area we have to focus our attack on.’<br/><br/>Every boss monster had its soft spot, and the Fire Giant was no exception.<br/><br/>Sungwoo walked towards the Fire Giant without any hesitation.<br/><br/>“Poisonous cloud!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo showed off his new skill.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuuuh ―<br/><br/>Then, dark clouds began to form at a rather low altitude in the sky over where Sungwoo was standing. It was a mixture of purple and green, a skill he had obtained after winning the mini-game, called ‘Poisonous Cloud Production’ skill.<br/><br/>But it was questionable whether something like poison would inflict any damage to such a huge fireball. But if it was rainwater coming down with poison, it might be able to annoy this monster composed of flames.<br/><br/>Pitter-patter, pitter-patter.<br/><br/>Raindrops started to fall. Sungwoo reached out his hand and adjusted the position of the clouds.<br/><br/>The raindrops gradually began to fall heavily. They were not heavy enough to put out the flames, but they could still lower the temperature of his body because his temperature was like his heartbeat.<br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>The Fire Giant screamed and reached out his hand to the building next to him. Then, he ripped a handful of the outer wall of the building and threw it at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>‘That’s dangerous.’<br/><br/>“Watch out!”<br/><br/>While manufacturing a bone shield, Sungwoo lowered his posture. Minsok hugged Hanho and hid behind the car while Jisu was ready to avoid the monster’s attack, concentrating all her senses.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>A firestorm swept through the area. Cars on the road were crushed and skeletons shattered. Furthermore, even the trees were smashed to pieces.<br/><br/>Weeeeeeing! Weeeeeeing!<br/><br/>Car alarms sounded here and there, and the water from fire hydrants on the sidewalk burst into the air.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>Hanho finally woke up after he was showered with cold water.<br/><br/>“Hey, if you have come to your senses, get up and throw your daggers!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/>Sungwoo threw the tattered bone shield, made a new bone shield, and rushed toward the Fire Giant.<br/><br/>As the poisonous clouds poured out heavy rain, smoke blew out of his head.<br/><br/>Sungwoo felt the flames of his body were much weaker now.<br/><br/>‘Yes, his soft spot is his head. I can only hit his head.’<br/><br/>In order to hit the Fire Giant’s head, Sungwoo had to make the monster lower his head.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo boldly approached the monster until he was within ten meters of him.<br/><br/>Thump- Thump-<br/><br/>At that moment, the monster bent his back and stretched out his hand toward him.<br/><br/>A pillar of fire erupted from the palm of the monster’s hand and struck Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>“Uh? Sungwoo!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo lifted the shield, but the huge flames swallowed his whole body in an instant.<br/><br/>“…Kuuuuuuuuek!”<br/><br/>Although Sungwoo was in Lich mode, he felt enormous pain, like a needle was pricking his whole body. The monster let out a tremendous roar as if tearing his eardrums.<br/><br/>Kugugugugugugu ―<br/><br/>As a child, Sungwoo was scared of fire. So, he hated fire. Fire took everything away from him, but he was not scared anymore.<br/><br/>The flames that crushed Sungwoo’s body were gone. Sungwoo wriggled behind the charcoaled bone shield. By now, he should have been burnt to ash, but he was intact. After gnashing his teeth tight, he let out a breath, at last.<br/><br/>“I am not dying in this fire.”<br/><br/>He earned the title of “Amateur Dragon Hunter ” and 30% immunity to fire after hunting the Drake. In addition, he earned an additional 30% fire immunity by combining ‘Drake’s Leather’ and the ‘Shadow King’s Robe.’ He had a total fire immunity of 60%.<br/><br/>In other words, no matter how strong the flames were, they could not inflict more than 40% damage to him.<br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/>Even the Fire Giant was questioning what was happening.<br/><br/>‘Yeah, now is the time!’<br/><br/>While Sungwoo was drawing his attention, somebody approached the monster from behind.<br/><br/>It leaped from the roof of an eight-story building, fell on the head of the monster, grabbed his skull, and struck him down to the ground.<br/><br/>It was Ogre Skeleton. Sungwoo had summoned that large skeleton on the roof of the building. Although the Fire Giant was huge, Ogre skeleton was also pretty large. The head of the Fire Giant struck the asphalt. However, due to the enormous heat, Ogre Skeleton began to melt.<br/><br/>‘Now is the time. I don’t have much time.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo jumped off the ground and took the hand cannon from the waist. Then, he pulled the trigger, aiming at the giant’s forehead.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>There was a crack in his skull and an explosion, but one shot was not enough to break it.<br/><br/>“Orun!”<br/><br/>As soon as he shouted, Orun bounced to Sungwoo’s right. Orun threw away his knife and took out his hand cannon.<br/><br/>As Orun got closer, his bones began to melt, but he finally squeezed into it. Then, he pushed the muzzle into the crack in the giant’s skull and pulled the trigger.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>At that moment, the giant’s forehead shattered like ceramic. At the same time, both arms of Ogre Skeleton shattered because of the heat.<br/><br/>Goowoooooooooo ―<br/><br/>The monster staggered before raising his body, but Sungwoo was faster. He stabbed Grim Reaper’s long blade into the cracks.<br/><br/>When Sungwoo pulled it, the giant’s skull was split in half.<br/><br/>Ahhhhhhhhh!<br/><br/>The monster fell, roaring. There was something in his cracked skull. It was a red bead.<br/><br/>‘That’s it.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo recalled that when the monster appeared that marble appeared before the flames formed around it.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuk!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo jumped into the flames and stretched out his left hand. The enormous heat crushed his whole body, but thanks to his flame immunity, he overcame it. He managed to grab the marble and pull it out<br/><br/>Poohhhhhhhhh!<br/><br/>The monster’s massive body collapsed and a vast amount of fire and heat scattered in all directions.<br/><br/>-You have earned 2,800,000 gold by hunting the ‘Fire Giant’.<br/><br/>The towering flames disappeared completely.<br/><br/>“Uh, did you kill the monster? I’m not dreaming, right?”<br/><br/>Hanho was still blinking without coming to his senses yet.<br/><br/>Jisu also stared at the stunning scene unfolding before her eyes, and Minsok gave a burst of hollow laughter. And the players who escaped from the burning building also looked dumbfounded as if they could not believe what they had witnessed.<br/><br/>– Oh! I forgot this, too!<br/><br/>At that moment, Nabi’s voice was transmitted through the fairy communication network.<br/><br/>-By the way, you have to destroy the core inside the Fire Giant’s head to hunt him! Kangsok had a hard time trying that, so be careful!<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>“I know.”<br/><br/> <br/><br/>– What? How do you know?<br/><br/>“I just cracked open his skull.”<br/><br/>– What? Did you do it already? No way! Are you kidding me?<br/><br/>Sometimes there were people who didn’t want to believe what the Necromancer had done, but they came to believe him when they witnessed his brilliant activities.<br/><br/>-Kangsok! Looks like these guys are faster than us.<br/><br/>However, the flames were not extinguished yet. There was the real boss monster left.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was thinking of going into the flames. </div><h2 id="chapter161">Chapter 161</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>The Fire Giant was the middle boss of the ‘Hell’s Gate’ quest. Nevertheless, he was more threatening than most of the powerful boss monsters.<br/><br/>‘Man, if something went awry, I would have ended up being killed without seeing the boss monster’s face.’<br/><br/>Fortunately, Sungwoo succeeded in hunting the Fire Giant using his plan. Otherwise, he would not have beaten the monster with overwhelming power.<br/><br/>Sungwoo realized the recommended level was not for nothing.<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked down at the red marble he held in his hand.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Fire Spirit<br/><br/>-Class: Hero<br/><br/>-Category: Production Material<br/><br/>-Description: It contains a powerful fire force that does not exist in the real world. If the conditions are met, you may control it through mana.<br/><br/>Based on his experiences in material combination, Sungwoo thought it might be good material, but that was not the end.<br/><br/>Chiiiiiiiiiii-<br/><br/>A certain pattern began to be engraved on the back of his hand holding the core.<br/><br/>It was a symbol of an unknown shape.<br/><br/>-You have been ‘imprinted’ by the curse of hell. The demons of this earth will chase you.<br/><br/>* This curse is canceled when you succeed in hunting the boss monster (Hell Moving Armor).<br/><br/>By dealing with the middle boss, the Fire Giant, it became inevitable for Sungwoo to face an all-out battle with the Hell Moving Armor.<br/><br/>‘I didn’t plan to avoid you anyway.’<br/><br/>In some respects, it might be a favorable fight for Sungwoo because if the Hell Moving Armor came to his place, it could create a pretty good situation for the fight.<br/><br/>‘In that case, I can fight in a more favorable situation.’<br/><br/>The battlefield was very important. Just as a small area is advantageous when dealing with a large enemy, it was an important factor in determining victory or defeat.<br/><br/>In that respect, this kind of downtown was unfavorable to Sungwoo. It was complicated, and there were too many things to burn everywhere.<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked back at his party.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, you saw this message a moment ago, right?”<br/><br/>“Is that boss monster finally coming to us now?”<br/><br/>Others were now in the same situation as him.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo nodded and said, “Let’s make a trap.”<br/><br/>He was thinking of providing another hell for those monsters who came from hell.<br/><br/>It would be a decisive attack that would elevate Sungwoo to the No. 1 position, replacing Kangsok Han.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The place Sungwoo chose was the playground of a local middle school. There was nothing to burn there, so it would be the best battlefield for him.<br/><br/>He met some unexpected helpers. They were the players he met when confronting the Fire Giant.<br/><br/>“I have collected all the fire extinguishers in the school!”<br/><br/>“I have brought the fire extinguishers from the vehicles.”<br/><br/>“I’ve obtained 11 fire extinguishers for throwing purposes.”<br/><br/>They said they were a group of survivors from the Pyongtaek area, but they were in the middle of evacuating to the north as the Hell Gate opened.<br/><br/>However, they seemed to have judged that they had higher chances of surviving when they acted together with Sungwoo than going to the north recklessly to avoid the Hellhounds.<br/><br/>“You can stack the fire extinguishers on one side over there.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo collected as many fire extinguishers as possible. The monsters could burn the surroundings by simply being there. So, he needed to secure enough equipment to put out the fire before confronting such a tough enemy.<br/><br/>“I buried them well.”<br/><br/>“Good.”<br/><br/>They also dug around the playground and buried the corpses.<br/><br/>‘I’m going to kill them with the corpse explosion.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo was thinking of luring them there.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, we’re all done. Let’s get into the building slowly…”<br/><br/>At that moment, a blue light flashed in the eastern sky.<br/><br/>“Uh? Lightning? Wasn’t it just lightning?”<br/><br/>Hanho also witnessed the ray of light. Even though it was broad daylight, he could see the trajectory clearly. The eyes of those working nearby turned to it.<br/><br/>“Did you see it?”<br/><br/>“Lightning on such a sunny day?”<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuggung! Kuuuuuuugung!<br/><br/>Then, another light flashed. It was a vivid ray of light falling from the sky to the ground, then another ray, and another…<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuugung! Kuuuuuugung!<br/><br/>Then, dozens of flashes simultaneously and randomly hit the ground.<br/><br/>“Oh, my God!”<br/><br/>The area hit by that lightning would obviously have been devastated.<br/><br/>‘No way!’<br/><br/>Obviously, the monsters were coming from the direction of Ansung. It was another ‘Hell Moving Armor,’ but Kangsok was supposed to get rid of that monster.<br/><br/>At that moment, Jisu shouted from the rooftop, “They are coming!”<br/><br/>They could not afford to watch the lightning leisurely because gray smoke began to pour over the school fence.<br/><br/>“Everyone, get inside the building!”<br/><br/>“Move! Move!”<br/><br/>After finishing the work, the players began to evacuate quickly into the building.<br/><br/>“Uh! It’s hot!”<br/><br/>The sound of the monsters stomping on the ground was heard from all sides, and the hot air pushed inside. It was a hellish heatwave<br/><br/>‘It is definitely different. It’s much hotter.’<br/><br/>The Fire Giant also heated the air in the affected area, but the heat was not as intense as this.<br/><br/>After evacuating everyone into the school, Sungwoo stood in the middle of the playground.<br/><br/>Soon, the barking of dogs was heard from outside the school, across the road, and from across the building.<br/><br/>Bark! Bark! Bark!<br/><br/>They were the Hellhounds. They appeared with the sound of a strong force shaking the ground just like charging knights. Then, they gently crossed the three-meter-high fence and ran to the playground.<br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrrrr―<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned 10 troll skeletons and had them surround his body. Then, he armed them with the bone armor and bone shields.<br/><br/>‘I have to hold out here until they come fully inside.’<br/><br/>Now, the Hellhounds entered the playground one after another.<br/><br/>Bark! Bark!<br/><br/>They circled the troll skeletons and filled their mouths with flames as if they were releasing the flames. Even if the skeletons were armed with shields and armor, they could not endure that intense hellfire for long.<br/><br/>‘Come inside a little more.’<br/><br/>Another herd of Hellhounds entered after breaking open the school gate. So far, a total of fourteen Hellhounds came in, but that was not enough. After that, several Hellhounds destroyed the iron fence to break in. Now, a total of nineteen Hellhounds. They were still far less than what Sungwoo aimed for. He could see lots more coming toward him from a distance.<br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/>Like hyenas surrounding a water buffalo, they slowly began to approach the playground, tilting their heads.<br/><br/>And the one that approached Sungwoo opened his mouth. Flames were coming out of his throat. Sungwoo took out the repeating crossbow and fired through the bones of the troll skeletons.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>Arrows were stuck in his tongue and nose, as well as his left eye. At that moment, six Hellhounds released flames at once.<br/><br/>Fuhuuuuuuuuuuuuuuua!<br/><br/>A tremendous heat filled the playground and burned all the oxygen in the area.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>The bones of the troll skeletons were heated and turned orange. Sungwoo felt like he was being fried in the oven.<br/><br/>‘Come on!’<br/><br/>Now, the Hellhounds increased to twenty-nine.<br/><br/>The bone shields cracked and turned into ashes.<br/><br/>A tremendous amount of heat entered through the bones of the troll skeletons.<br/><br/>Thirty-four then forty-one Hellhounds came. They kept increasing.<br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t hold out any more.<br/><br/>‘I’ve got to escape!’<br/><br/>At that moment, black wings soared behind him. It was a zombie monster bird. That bird grabbed Sungwoo’s shoulders with its feet and spread its wings. Then, it soared vertically into the sky.<br/><br/>“Explosion!”<br/><br/>As soon as he escaped from the playground, he ignited the explosives he planted.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>The entire playground vibrated, flipped, and bounced. Coarse sand splattered in all directions, breaking the school windows. Red flames soared and swallowed the Hellhounds, whose bodies were smashed by the tremendous impact.<br/><br/>-You have earned 15,000 gold by hunting the ‘Hellhound’.<br/><br/>-You have earned 15,000 gold by hunting the ‘Hellhound’.<br/><br/>-You have earned 15,000 gold by hunting the ‘Hellhound’.<br/><br/>-You have earned 15,000 gold by hunting the ‘Hellhound’.<br/><br/>A huge number of messages appeared. Sungwoo flew to the rooftop of the school and landed there. The playground was devastated as if it had been hit by a missile.<br/><br/>“Whew! Nice…”<br/><br/>He killed almost 50 Hellhounds in an instant. He minimized the risk factor by killing them, so he could focus on his last target.<br/><br/>At that moment, a nearby shopping mall collapsed due to the explosions.<br/><br/>A huge shadow wriggled among the fragments behind a hazy dust curtain,<br/><br/>-Boss monster “Hell Moving Armor” has appeared.<br/><br/>Finally, he appeared.<br/><br/>Rattle ― Rattle ―<br/><br/>He was wearing huge armor, with a five-meter-long “spear” behind his waist.<br/><br/>Like a heated whetstone, he vibrated the air around him.<br/><br/>Every time he moved a step closer, all the weeds and street trees were engulfed in flames.<br/><br/>So, it was almost impossible for Sungwoo to approach the monster.<br/><br/>“Good. Let me carry out the second operation.”<br/><br/>-You have summoned ‘Golem (Flesh)’.<br/><br/>-You have summoned Golem (Flesh)’.<br/><br/>Sungwoo used the golem summoning skill. His target was all the kinds of corpses strewn all over the playground. They spontaneously rose as if being drawn by a magnet, then began to merge randomly like a giant clay doll. Then, a 10-meter ‘Flesh Golem’ was born.<br/><br/>Rattle ― Rattle ―<br/><br/>The terrible monsters made of corpses went ahead, and the troll skeletons that had been killed with explosions were reborn. They moved forward along with the golem, carrying bone shields and “maces” made of bones.<br/><br/>-Synergy effect is given by team play.<br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Armor Breaker (Stage 1)<br/><br/>-Class: weapon synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: Equip at least 10 blunt weapons<br/><br/>-Effect: Causes faint with a certain probability (6%), additional damage to medium and large monsters (+ 15%), additional damage to plate armor (+ 10%)<br/><br/>Sungwoo even prepared synergy for such big armor because the best way to break through the plate armor was, after all, hitting it with a heavy object.<br/><br/>“Then, start!”<br/><br/>Nine monster birds flew from the rooftop. They were holding something in both feet, then dropped them towards the Hell Moving Armor all at once.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck! </div><h2 id="chapter162">Chapter 162</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-<br/><br/>That was the sound of fire extinguishers being thrown. The powder of the fire extinguisher scattered in all directions, blocking oxygen. That alone would significantly lower the surrounding temperature.<br/><br/>The monster birds that successfully used the fire extinguishers quickly raised their altitudes.<br/><br/>At that moment, the monster raised his left hand.<br/><br/>A fireball, or a huge sphere of fire, spewed out of his palm, covering the sky.<br/><br/>Hit by that fireball, two monster birds crashed.<br/><br/>“Fire extinguisher team, go!”<br/><br/>Hanho and the players pulled the hose out of the indoor fire hydrant in the school.<br/><br/>After pulling out the 25-meter hose, they grabbed the tip of the hose and aimed over the fence.<br/><br/>“Turn it on!”<br/><br/>“Turn on the water!”<br/><br/>Pooooooooooooooh!<br/><br/>The cloth hose swelled and gushed like a water cannon. After soaking the body of the Flesh Golem, the water stream was blown out toward the Hell Moving Armor.<br/><br/>However, the temperature around it was so high that most of the water evaporated before it even reached the ground.<br/><br/>“Keep blowing the water!”<br/><br/>“The temperature will go down!”<br/><br/>Cheeeeeeeeee!<br/><br/>Like a wet sauna, the whole area was covered with vapor.<br/><br/>“Now, let me go and attack the monster,” said Sungwoo, jumping off the roof.<br/><br/>Minsok and Orun followed him, jumping down to the ground.<br/><br/>“Are we all done if we kill that monster?”<br/><br/>“Yes. Do attack the monster as much as you can.”<br/><br/>Since they were prepared thoroughly in advance, it was time for them to confront the monster directly.<br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/>Three Hellhounds raised themselves among the piles of corpses on the playground.<br/><br/>The three-meter beasts lowered their bodies, so Sungwoo and his party could get on them.<br/><br/>“Let’s get on.”<br/><br/>They got on the Hellhound skeletons.<br/><br/>“Let’s go!”<br/><br/>The Hellhound skeletons jumped off the ground. They ran at tremendous speed. Sungwoo ran towards the Hell Moving Armor and lifted the Grim Reaper. Minsok and Orun stood side by side.<br/><br/>And the moment they jumped over the fence, they disappeared into the black smoke that suddenly appeared.<br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in the affected area.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Death Response’ begins in the affected area.<br/><br/>Soon, three Hellhound skeletons popped out of the black smoke, followed by dozens of undead headed by Bone Drake and Ogre Skeleton. Furthermore, two Bone Wyverns soared into the sky.<br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/>The undead army launched a frontal assault on the single enemy: the Hell Moving Armor.<br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/>The Hell Moving Armor approached them loftily, holding a 5-meter-sized spear.<br/><br/>“Fire extinguisher, ready to fire!”<br/><br/>In the meantime, the human monster skeletons, summoned for this fight, were holding fire extinguishers. When Sungwoo ordered, they pulled out the safety pin and lifted the nozzle at the same time.<br/><br/>“Disperse!”<br/><br/>Shortly before they encountered the monster, Sungwoo shouted. They scattered to the right and left, forming a circle around the monster.<br/><br/>The monster stopped and looked around once. Then, he slowly raised his left hand for a fire sphere attack.<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo shouted, “Release!”<br/><br/>The human monster skeletons released the extinguishing agent all at once. Although the shooting distance was not long, the extinguishing agent powder spread in all directions, forming a thick veil. By blocking oxygen, it caused the target to suffocate.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, the flame sphere that flew through the veil was noticeably smaller.<br/><br/>Even the magic of hell seemed to be unable to completely ignore the laws of nature.<br/><br/>‘Poisonous Cloud!’<br/><br/>In addition to this, dark clouds formed over the monster’s head, spraying raindrops.<br/><br/>Cheeeeeeeeeeee! Cheeeeeeeeee!<br/><br/>The raindrops were getting stronger and heavier, and his body temperature dropped considerably. In other words, they could approach and attack him.<br/><br/>“Attack!”<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Troll skeletons with shields and maces stepped forward first. They were armed with synergy power that could break the plate armor.<br/><br/>Booooooooooong!<br/><br/>However, before they got close enough to attack the monster, he swung his huge spear violently, smashing five troll skeletons with a single stroke.<br/><br/>It caused tremendous damage to Sungwoo. At the same time, huge flames broke out and engulfed the herd of ghouls. Dozens of them collapsed at once.<br/><br/>‘How could they collapse like that when they were wearing bone armor and had bone shields? It’s dangerous!’<br/><br/>But Sungwoo looked for a loophole in his attack for a decisive counterattack.<br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/>Sungwoo struck the monster’s right shoulder and got out of the striking range of his huge spear.<br/><br/>The moment the monster looked back at Sungwoo, Minsok ran from the other side and smacked his back. Then, Orun fired the hand cannon while passing by his ribs quickly.<br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/>When Sungwoo’s allies attacked him intensively at the same time, the Hell Moving Armor’s huge body began to stagger. In the meantime, the troll skeletons that had been cut in half were completely regenerated. No matter how high their damages were, they could be revived as long as they didn’t die. The troll skeletons advanced again.<br/><br/>At that moment, gray smoke erupted from his helmet like a long sigh. It looked like the monster was determined to fight it out. He grabbed the giant spear, then stuck the troll skeleton at the forefront and lifted it.<br/><br/>Kwagagagagagaga!<br/><br/>At that moment, a flame swirled from the spear and swallowed the troll skeleton. Then it melted and shredded its thick bone like a mixer. The skeleton turned to ashes and disappeared.<br/><br/>‘That’s dangerous.’<br/><br/>Troll skeletons were regenerated no matter how often they were attacked, but if they turned to ashes like that, they were unrecoverable.<br/><br/>‘I’ve got to make sure I do not lose these important undead.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo stopped in the shadow and lifted his repeating crossbow.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>The enhanced arrows struck him in the back of the head. The monster turned and raised his left hand. Six flame spheres were fired at Sungwoo, but he wasn’t there. Sungwoo had already moved to another shadow.<br/><br/>The monster started looking around for Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/>Seizing that moment, Ogre Skeleton rushed and threw his punch using the lightning skill of his bracelet.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>Blue lightning rained down on the Hell Moving Armor with a powerful impact. It was powerful enough to blow up a whole building, but it only made him kneel.<br/><br/>But that was enough.<br/><br/>While he could not move for a moment, the two Flesh Golems charged at the monster, followed by 25 zombies.<br/><br/>“Tie him up!”<br/><br/>Two large Flesh Golems, whose bodies were sufficiently wet, pressed the Hell-Moving Armor with their huge weight. Then, 25 zombies crawled all over his body and stuck to him like leeches. They pressed the monster with their overwhelming weight, so he could not move.<br/><br/>Then the troll skeletons were in charge of attacking the monster. They started wielding maces through the gap between the Flesh Golems and zombies.<br/><br/>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!<br/><br/>With a loud noise, the monster’s massive armor began to crack.<br/><br/>‘But the damage is not severe enough.’<br/><br/>The monster hardly showed any signs of collapsing. Rather, the zombies who could not withstand the heat fell and were revived repeatedly. It looked like the monster would break free at any moment.<br/><br/>‘They should not let him break free. This fight will take longer if he does. We have to kill him now.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo did not forget that this fight was a competition.<br/><br/>‘I have to kill him fast. Legendary grade items are up for grabs.’<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo decided to attack more aggressively.<br/><br/>He canceled the summon of the Grim Reaper.<br/><br/>Then, the zombies that were dying were no longer revived. Even the giant Flesh Golem made up of about a hundred corpses fell into a pile of corpses. The corpses piled up around the monster. Sungwoo used them for corpse explosions.<br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>A massive explosion soared from just one point. Not the heat, but the shock crushed the monster’s armor. The outer walls of the surrounding buildings were torn off, and the windows collapsed. Troll skeletons bounced several meters away.<br/><br/>Kugugugugugugugu―<br/><br/>It was a huge explosion, comparable to the thunderstorm in the eastern sky, which had been visible to everyone in the vicinity.<br/><br/>Even though the monster came from hell, he couldn’t withstand the explosion concentrated in one place.<br/><br/>Sungwoo killed the monster with a single stroke.<br/><br/>-You have earned 4,500,000 gold by hunting the quest boss monster ‘Hell Moving Armor-2’.<br/><br/>-Additional rewards are given for attacking below the recommended level. (Class B EXP Card)<br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 20)<br/><br/>-All stats increase because you reached level 20. (+2)<br/><br/>-You have acquired the title of ‘Hell Repeller’.<br/><br/>* Agility increases (+2)<br/><br/>* Curse/magic immunity increases (+10%)<br/><br/>Sungwoo received a huge reward and even a title.<br/><br/>‘Wait a minute.’<br/><br/>But he suddenly felt the events were rather strange.<br/><br/>“Are we done?” asked Minsok.<br/><br/>That was the problem. This quest was not supposed to end like this. He heard that the quest would be completed when he was done attacking both places.<br/><br/>So, the game was not supposed to end the moment Sungwoo killed the Hell-Moving Armor.<br/><br/>At that moment, he heard the fairy Nabi’s voice.<br/><br/>– Hello! How regrettable! It was exactly 118 seconds apart!<br/><br/>It meant that the Hell-Moving Armor in the Ansung area was killed first. Nabi was laughing over the fairy communication network.<br/><br/>‘I lost.’<br/><br/>He lost by a hair’s breadth, but Kangsok showed why he was ranked No. 1 on the Korean server. Although Sungwoo didn’t know what kind of job he had and what kind of skills he used, Kangsok was a strong player.<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo suddenly felt something wriggling in his arms, so he pulled it out.<br/><br/>“This one?”<br/><br/>The myth-grade item, “The Seed of the World Tree,” which he had obtained after killing Drake and completing the “Group Quest,” was shining clearly.<br/><br/>And a surprising message appeared.<br/><br/>-You have satisfied the conditions for planting the seeds of the World Tree by meeting certain conditions (namely, acquiring the title of “Hell Repeller”).<br/><br/>* You can grow the World Tree as its ‘guardian’, and the World Tree will grow under your influence.<br/><br/>‘I can now plant the World Tree?’<br/><br/>Even though Sungwoo lost, it seemed that he got a tremendous opportunity. </div><h2 id="chapter163">Chapter 163</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">

<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Now, the enemies’ strategy was somewhat clear. By confining Sungwoo inside the building, they sought to make it impossible for Sungwoo to summon his main weapon, the large Undead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it didn’t mean that they incapacitated Sungwoo completely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Protect the families inside the classroom as much as possible. I will block them from approaching here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That’s what Sungwoo could tell them at this point, but the situation got worse and worse.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wuuuuuuuuuuung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>One ton trucks lined up in front of the school and stopped near the basketball court.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the human monsters on standby ran and opened the luggage compartments.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bizarre creatures began to move from them. They were monsters with a human head, a human body in tatters, and beast limbs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They are not normal monsters.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were the final results of the unethical experiments by the Evolution Society.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those bizarre monsters jumped out of the trucks and started running towards the school.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was no more time for Sungwoo and his party to watch the monsters running toward them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho, Jisu, stay here. Let me close the hallway.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo told Jisu and Hanho to stay in the classroom and help the players because fighting entangled in a narrow corridor could interfere with each other’s fighting style.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have summoned the killer scythe, ‘Grim Reaper’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grim Reaper retention time (00:21:11)<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The remaining time is only 21 minutes.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The current situation was the worst. Cooldown or waiting time was required for Sungwoo’s use of his skills, such as summoning golems and Response to Death. As a result, Sungwoo’s strength was reduced by more than half.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Well, I just hope the Crusaders can arrive within 21 minutes and make a path to retreat…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo took Minsok and Orun out of the classroom and into the hallway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They’re right there!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Three Werewolves appeared at the end of the hallway. They ran down the hall with swords and axes. Sungwoo immediately raised his repeating crossbow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the corridor was narrow, the monsters had no time to avoid the arrows, but the monsters lifted something round. Then, a translucent shield was formed around them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Protective shield?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, the enemies were thoroughly prepared. They prepared not only such a small protective shield but also held gas masks. They were armed with that weapon after finding out that the black smoke emitted by Sungwoo had a curse effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were thoroughly prepared to kill this big guy called Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Surround them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Somebody’s voice was heard from behind. They had already snuck into the building, closing in on Sungwoo and his party from all sides.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me defend in the rear,” Minsok said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, please.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo left Minsok and Ornn behind and confronted the human monsters charging from the front.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The hallway was so narrow that Sungwoo couldn’t use the Grim Reaper properly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He grabbed the handle of the Grim Reaper as wide as possible and struck the translucent shield the Werewolf was pushing against him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The shield blocked the arrows, but not the Grim Reaper’s powerful impact. The shield shattered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me kill you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, another human monster stabbed his sword toward the back of Sungwoo’s neck, but he stepped back and swung the Grim Reaper at the monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monster’s whole arm was cut off. Another monster jumped over his colleague’s shoulder and swung his ax at a tremendous speed, but Sungwoo was faster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 25,000 gold by hunting ‘Stage 2 Werewolf’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo lifted the Grim Reaper and cut the monster in half. His stats were overwhelming. In particular, since all his stats increased by 10 when he was in Lich status, the monsters could not confront him properly in terms of strength and agility no matter how strong the human monsters were.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the human monsters showed soft spots, Sungwoo immediately lifted his repeating crossbow and fired arrows. This time they couldn’t stop the arrows. Three Werewolves fell on the floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok and Orun also killed two human monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They’re on the first floor! They are all gathered on the first floor!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the zombie monsters kept coming inside the school building. They popped up from both ends of the corridor, broke the windows, entered the classroom, and went back into the corridor. Their footsteps were even heard on the second floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And outside the window, the monster snipers were approaching. In this situation, just holding out where they were was not the best option. If they got stuck in one place, they would be showered with the monsters’ arrows and magic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They’re coming in!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Block them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the monsters began to infiltrate into the classroom where the players were holding out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>All sorts of screams and frictions were heard inside. Although Jisu was the best melee attacker, she could not protect other people at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘We can’t stop them like this anymore.’ Sungwoo thought. ‘We need another strategy.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He thought hard about the best possible tactic to stop them. He thought of all the possible options. He had to be aggressive from now on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, he hit upon one idea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Minsok, hold out here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit under your authority.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead will be your subordinate spirit under your authority.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had Minsok defend the entrance to the classroom, then resurrected the two Werewolves. Then, he headed toward the end of the corridor. Soon, the zombie monsters were breaking into the corridor after passing by the lobby.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Guuuuuuuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They came running, screaming in pain. Their movements were very deformed, their bodies twisting with every step.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had the Werewolf Skeletons collide with them head-on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quazzzzzzzzik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the zombie monster stretched his left arm and penetrated the skull of one Werewolf skeleton. Not caring about it, Sungwoo pushed in, taking out the hand cannon from his waist.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The hand cannon’s destructive power was also extraordinary. The heads of two zombie monsters were smashed entirely, and the other two monsters behind them were also pushed back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 100 gold by hunting the ‘Experiment No.-022’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 100 gold by hunting the ‘ Experiment No.-022’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only 100 gold?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was dumbfounded by that small reward, but he couldn’t afford to care about it now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He swung the Grim Reaper sideways without worrying about it being stuck on the wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the Grim Reaper cut the heads of the two zombie monsters then scraped the left side of the wall and destroyed it. The next moment, a gust swept the hallway. The Grim Reaper kicked the body of the crumbling monster. The body of the beheaded monster was thrown into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The zombie monsters coming into the hallway were thrown out in flames. Sungwoo lifted the repeating crossbow and fired arrows towards the monsters who lost their balance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the ignition arrow function on, the zombie monsters were engulfed in flames.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo pushed ahead and arrived at a relatively large area: the lobby.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, he used his prime skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in the affected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Black smoke rose, filling the lobby in an instant. Then, it stretched out into the hallway and soared out of the window.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He used the gas weapon!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wear a gas mask!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the voices of the human monsters ringing everywhere, Sungwoo pulled out two items in the black smoke. They were ‘Human Monster Ampoule (Werewolf)’ and ‘Devil’s Door Scroll’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Let me camouflage myself as a human monster and go behind them, then use the Devil’s Door Scroll.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Devil’s Door Scroll, which he captured in the pirate ship, was a dungeon with a recommended level of 35. Considering that the recommended level of the ‘Hell’s Gate’ was 27, this was an extremely difficult level. That’s why the pirates used this item as a “strategic weapon” to destroy a certain area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I was thinking of saving it, but this is not the time to save it.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo intended to drop a “nuclear bomb” on these monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He prepared the item that the pirates had made by themselves, namely ‘Human Monster Ampoule (Werewolf)’. When he uses this item, he will turn into a Werewolf and would remain in that condition for 20 minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo inserted a syringe containing the ampoule into his thigh.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuuuuk!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He felt a tingling pain on his thigh, then his pelvis, and finally his spine. His body swelled and his hair began to grow thicker. His skull was transformed, causing extreme pain in his face. Now, he felt his senses were expanding.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have temporarily become a ‘Werewolf’ due to the item effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But that wasn’t the end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Special conditions have been satisfied.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Lich (Death Controller) + Human Monster (Werewolf)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The unexpected combination was completed when his Lich condition was mixed with the Human Monster process.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Temporarily you have gained the power of the death god ‘Anubis’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Temporarily you have become a demigod.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-All stats are greatly increased. (+10)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You can use the skill .<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You can use the skill .<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You can use the skill .<br/><br/><br/><br/>Variables always existed in this kind of game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the black smoke slowly faded away, a black wolf with a huge black scythe rose.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A purple wave spread around him. </div><h2 id="chapter165">Chapter 165</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Members of the Evolution Society were on alert after getting out of the black smoke. They were already aware that the Necromancer sprayed gas that caused abnormal conditions.<br/><br/>However, an unexpected scene unfolded.<br/><br/>“What the heck is that…”<br/><br/>“Human monster?”<br/><br/>As the smoke slowly faded away, there stood a creature among the white demons, exuding strange energy. It was a black wolf wearing a dark green robe, bone armor, and a huge black scythe.<br/><br/>-Your body function is weakened due to unknown energy.<br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-2)<br/><br/>“A drop in stats?”<br/><br/>“What’s going on here?”<br/><br/>They weren’t entitled to detect the “godly stature” of the creature. A phenomenon that they couldn’t understand was happening right before their eyes.<br/><br/>However, they instantly knew that their death was nearing.<br/><br/>“Shoot!”<br/><br/>As soon as someone shouted, they fired dozens of arrows and magic at the black wolf.<br/><br/>However, Werebear skeletons bounced forward and blocked all the arrows with their bodies. The next moment the upper and lower bodies of those human monsters at the forefront were cut in half. The black wolf’s giant scythe cut through their torsos.<br/><br/>“Damn it! When did he attack us?”<br/><br/>The black wolf, which was in the lobby of the building until a few moments ago, was now right in front of them.<br/><br/>“Block him!”<br/><br/>The human monsters hurriedly took out melee weapons to respond, but the black wolf was overwhelmingly fast.<br/><br/>Boowoong!<br/><br/>Wielding the huge scythe freely, the black wolf slaughtered the human monsters and zombie monsters who were blocking the entrance. It was as if a grinder passed by them.<br/><br/>‘I feel completely different from before.’<br/><br/>The black wolf, Sungwoo, was feeling an overwhelming power throughout his body.<br/><br/>[Player Profile]<br/><br/>-Name: Sungwoo Yu<br/><br/>-Level: 20<br/><br/>-Job: Anubis’ Incarnation (Demi-God)<br/><br/>-Ability: Strength (23+29), Agility (19+26), Stamina (16+27)<br/><br/>-Reserve Gold: 36,455,405<br/><br/>-Trait: Chaos<br/><br/>His growth this time was fundamentally different from before. He had empowered himself by strengthening subordinate spirits with his skills until now, but this time his physical ability has grown explosively.<br/><br/>All stats ranging from Lich buffs to Anubis buffs increased by 20 points each.<br/><br/>‘I’m no longer in a human body.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo moved slowly. He felt much lighter, and at the same time, he felt much harder.<br/><br/>Even with the same stats, a human monster’s body structure was much tougher and more resilient than the actual human body. So, it’s moved more efficiently.<br/><br/>-You exploit the soul. (Cumulative: 11)<br/><br/>And at the scene of the slaughter, a black light came up and was sucked into Sungwoo’s body.<br/><br/>It was the “soul exploitation” skill.<br/><br/>-You have strengthened the undead with exploited souls (10). (1 stack)<br/><br/>* Remaining Soul: 1<br/><br/>Furthermore, it wasn’t just Sungwoo alone who became stronger. As his modifier of “the god of death” suggested, Sungwoo could strengthen his subordinate spirits by exploiting the soul of his prey. Even his senses transcended human abilities. Sungwoo sensed an arrow flying from a long distance and leaped back. Five arrows hit and stuck in the place where he was just standing.<br/><br/>“Catch him!”<br/><br/>Somewhere, a loud voice rang out. Behind the shield line in front of the school was a gray bull.<br/><br/>It was a Werebull. It seemed that he was the commander of this operation.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuueeh!<br/><br/>When the Werebull ordered, many zombie monsters rushed at Sungwoo. They stretched their cloth-made arms and swung their arms from a distance.<br/><br/>‘If I fight against them, I may be exposed to sniping.’<br/><br/>Still, they were in an advantageous situation. If Sungwoo got entangled with their cloth arms, he could be killed by their intensive attack.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Sungwoo moved the undead to collide with the cloth monsters. Then, he turned around and ran to the snipers who were besieging the school building.<br/><br/>“Shit! Ahhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>-You earned 21,000 gold by hunting ‘Tier 2 Wererat.’.<br/><br/>-You have exploited a soul. (Cumulative: 2)<br/><br/>Sungwoo jumped off the ground with tremendous strength and speed. They didn’t even dare think of getting away from him.<br/><br/>Sungwoo ran along the outer wall of the school and slaughtered the snipers dispatched at regular intervals there. Although they surrounded the entire building, he could easily destroy them one by one because they deserted their positions and ran away.<br/><br/>-You have exploited a soul. (Cumulative: 8)<br/><br/>After exploiting some souls, Sungwoo turned back.<br/><br/>A melee was unfolding in the middle of the school. However, Sungwoo’s undead were being pushed back by the enemies.<br/><br/>Although the undead could be resurrected indefinitely, the offensive of the cloth monsters was tough. Besides, since the enemy wizards poured out all kinds of AOE magic skills from behind the shield ranks, the undead were smashed immediately after being resurrected.<br/><br/>“Okay, push them like this! Prepare the ‘Silver Arrow of the Saint’!”<br/><br/>“Prepare the silver arrow!”<br/><br/>They took out a new weapon. It seemed that they were thoroughly prepared to hunt the Necromancer. Soon, the ranks of the shields split, and a Weretiger walked out among them.<br/><br/>The monster notched a 3-meter longbow.<br/><br/>Peeeeeeeeeeeng!<br/><br/>The moment he fired the arrow, the skeletons standing in the line of fire collapsed at once.<br/><br/>-Your family will return to eternal death by ‘sacred power’.<br/><br/>-Your family will return to eternal death by ‘sacred power’.<br/><br/>-Your family will return to eternal death by ‘sacred power’.<br/><br/>Only one arrow penetrated the three Werewolf skeletons. And the skeletons that were destroyed by the attack could not stand up again.<br/><br/>“Great! We can destroy them!”<br/><br/>“We can hunt them!”<br/><br/>There was a cheer from their camp here and there. One thing they feared most about the Necromancer was his ability to resurrect the undead no matter how often they killed them.<br/><br/>So, they thought that if they could incapacitate the Necromancer’s skills like that, they could deal with him confidently.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo had a new weapon, too.<br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/>-Name: Demonic Bombing<br/><br/>-Grade: Artisan<br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/>-Cost: 20 mana<br/><br/>‘Okay, let me corrupt the souls I accumulated through ‘soul exploitation’ and explode them with a powerful curse. (cooldown 30 seconds)<br/><br/>* Available Souls: 8<br/><br/>Sungwoo used the new skill ‘Evil Spirit Bombing’.<br/><br/>-‘Evil Spirit Bombing’ is embedded in your weapon.<br/><br/>The black energy was condensed along the blade of the Grim Reaper, then Sungwoo swung it toward the ranks of shields.<br/><br/>Boowoong!<br/><br/>Black souls shot out like missiles and poured over their heads.<br/><br/>Ku-o-o-o-o-gung!<br/><br/>The souls expanded, causing a massive explosion. Although there were no soaring flames or no major impact, powerful energy crushed the whole area with a black wave spreading.<br/><br/>As if tremendous gravity was working on it, their flesh was torn apart, and their shields were crushed.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>“Help me!”<br/><br/>Moreover, the attack didn’t cause just physical damages. When the black wave touched them, their souls were also damaged. There occurred even “immediate death” according to certain conditions.<br/><br/>-This is not an attack you can withstand.<br/><br/>Those who witnessed the message helplessly collapsed without even screaming.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this…”<br/><br/>Although the wizards cast spells on the shields, they were useless. Their tight formation that looked unbreakable collapsed at once.<br/><br/>-You have exploited a soul. (24 items)<br/><br/>Sungwoo instantly killed 24 monsters with 8 souls. Be it a sorcerer and a tanker, they could never survive once they were caught in the explosion of death.<br/><br/>And that wasn’t the end of the explosion.<br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>The corpse explosions ensued, swallowing up those who survived the first attack. Moreover, since Sungwoo’s skill level had risen to the ‘skilled’ level, a small amount of the ‘Breath of Abyss’ was released along with the explosion.<br/><br/>-You have exploited a soul. (34 items)<br/><br/>Pusheeeeeeee―<br/><br/>“Cough! Cough!”<br/><br/>“Wear a gas mask!”<br/><br/>The corpse explosions, coupled with the Evil Spirit Bombing, and the Breath of the Abyss, destroyed the shield ranks in an instant.<br/><br/>-‘Evil Spirit Bombing’ is embedded in your weapon.<br/><br/>After the 30 second cooldown, Sungwoo once again prepared the skill. Then, he threw it toward the collapsed ranks. This time, he fired 10 souls.<br/><br/>Ku-o-o-o-o-o-gung!<br/><br/>-You have exploited a soul. (55 items)<br/><br/>It was a perfect finish. There were no more ranks in the place devastated by the bombing.<br/><br/>Sungwoo enhanced the undead using 30 souls.<br/><br/>-You have enhanced the undead with exploited souls. (4 stacks)<br/><br/>The fight wasn’t over yet. It was true that Sungwoo inflicted huge damage, but the enemies’ power was still threatening.<br/><br/>“Move!” </div><h2 id="chapter166">Chapter 166</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Those monsters scattered to surround the building, the zombie monsters waiting in the rear and the cloth monsters in the trucks began to flock toward Sungwoo and his party. They numbered over one hundred.<br/><br/>“Everyone, withdraw from the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>Obviously, these monsters would not rush en masse like that to kill Sungwoo. Sungwoo thought there must be the so-called “hitman’ among them, who aimed at cutting his windpipe.<br/><br/>Finally, that monster appeared in front of Sungwoo.<br/><br/>The Werebull, a gray bull, came to the forefront.<br/><br/>“You guys, stop the undead. Let me hunt the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>Following his order, the monster troops began to close in on the undead. Obviously, they tried to separate the undead from Sungwoo, then attacked separately.<br/><br/>Thump-thump-<br/><br/>The Werebull approached Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Oh, Necromancer…your style has changed a little.”<br/><br/>The monster spoke, blowing out through his nostrils. All kinds of tattoos were engraved on his body, which was particularly muscular. He was holding a wooden shield engraved with a goblin in one hand and a flail in the other hand.<br/><br/>“Oh, Werewolf? Are you of the same race as us?” asked the Werebull.<br/><br/>“How are wolves and cows like you of the same race?” Sungwoo responded.<br/><br/>“We don’t divide our race, based on such a primitive concept. We have been born as human monsters and threw away the empty shells of humanity,” said the Werebull.<br/><br/>Sungwoo laughed it off and said, “Since you are talking nonsense like that, you must be one of the four fake cult leaders.”<br/><br/>Right after Sungwoo ambushed the Sindorim research center of the Evolution Society, there were human monsters called “four beasts” that he confirmed through the research director’s memory fragments.<br/><br/>The white wolf who used psychometry was one of them, and the pomade-haired man said that they were more powerful than player rankers.<br/><br/>“Oh, you know us.”<br/><br/>“Well, we have known each other for a long time, right?”<br/><br/>The Werebull blew out through his nostrils.<br/><br/>“As of today, our quest for each other will end. As you know, I am a ‘red flagman’, one of the so-called four beasts. I’ve come here to cut your windpipe.”<br/><br/>“Flagman? Is that your name?”<br/><br/>“I threw away my old name, which was an empty shell of my life during human days.”<br/><br/>-‘Evil Spirit Bomb’ is embedded in your weapon.<br/><br/>Sungwoo confirmed that the cooldown was over, so he immediately loaded the Evil Spirit Bomb. When a black spirit shrouded the Grim Reaper, the Werebull was on alert.<br/><br/>Boo-woooooong!<br/><br/>Sungwoo swung the Grim Reaper. The Evil Spirit Bomb dropped, but the monster raised the shield engraved with a goblin. At the same time, he displayed the magical power of the shield and covered his body with a red shield.<br/><br/>Goong― Gugung―<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Evil Spirit Bomb was blocked.<br/><br/>“This is useless now.”<br/><br/>Since the Werebull was dispatched to kill the Necromancer, he was armed with unusual items.<br/><br/>‘What a headache!’<br/><br/>In fact, Sungwoo had another big problem now.<br/><br/>-Grim Reaper retention time (00:12:33)<br/><br/>-Werewolf retention time (00:13:49)<br/><br/>In other words, Sungwoo could not afford to drag out this fight.<br/><br/>‘I’ve got to end this fight within ten minutes.’<br/><br/>At that moment, the Werebull shouted, “Hey, you can’t work things out as you expect, right? I can see it in your face.”<br/><br/>The Werebull was ready to attack Sungwoo. He closed in on Sungwoo, wielding the huge flail in his right hand, which was twice as big as his head.<br/><br/>In fact, a long time ago the Orc Chief Sungwoo had to deal with used a weapon like that.<br/><br/>It was dangerous because it constantly rotated, so it was hard to tell when and where it would fly toward him.<br/><br/>Boo-wooooong-<br/><br/>When he was dealing with the Orc Chief, Sungwoo could easily defeat the monster because he had the resurrected skeletons charge at him recklessly.<br/><br/>‘I can’t use the undead now.’<br/><br/>As if the human monsters thought the best way to deal with the Necromancer was a one-on-one fight, they were tenaciously attacking the undead group. So, he could not pull out a large number of them to help him out.<br/><br/>“Why are you looking elsewhere now?”<br/><br/>At that moment, Werebull narrowed the distance and swung the flail.<br/><br/>Sungwoo hurriedly lifted the Grim Reaper.<br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/>The two giants collided in the air, shaking the playground.<br/><br/>Now, the monster began to swing the flail at a faster speed.<br/><br/>Booooooooong-Boooooooog-Booooog-<br/><br/>“Are you not confident? Why are you trying to hide behind the undead all the time?”<br/><br/>It seemed the Werebull had the confidence to defeat the Necromancer in a one-on-one battle.<br/><br/>“Hey, because fighting in a cunning way is my fighting style.”<br/><br/>At that moment, the monster’s weapon turned into a purple chain then wrapped around the Grim Reaper. An unknown force pulled the Grim Reaper, and Sungwoo slipped.<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s repeating crossbow and hand cannon were drawn to the chain as if attracted by a magnet.<br/><br/>-Your weapon has been locked by the ‘fighter’s shackles’. (5 minutes)<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s weapon was stuck on the ground, entangled with the Werebull’s weapon.<br/><br/>And a purple chain icon emerged above it. It was literally “locked”.<br/><br/>“Locked?”<br/><br/>“Huhhhhh! Actually, I’m not the type who is fighting with a weapon.”<br/><br/>Then, the monster threw the shield and approached, turning his neck and wrists. Something like a red wave appeared in his hands. In the beginning, this monster’s job was fighting.<br/><br/>Now, the monster stretched out his forefoot and threw his left fist.<br/><br/>It was a jab. Sungwoo quickly stepped back, but the monster stepped forward, throwing a right-hand straight jab and right-foot middle kick.<br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/>Sungwoo allowed his middle kick. He felt a shock that seemed to break his ribs. He was thrown into the air before falling and rolling across the playground.<br/><br/>Then, the monster rushed at him, shaking the ground, but Sungwoo stood up straight and avoided his punch. However, the monster grabbed Sungwoo’s neck with his left hand and threw him down on the ground. A tremendous shock came up the spine.<br/><br/>“Hey, great Necromancer, the hero of the Korean server! But now you don’t have your subordinate spirits or weapons. What’s left?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo barely raised himself with his hand on the ground. As if he seized the moment to win, the monster threw a punch with a smile. If hit accurately, Sungwoo’s head would have been ripped apart.<br/><br/>Sungwoo wrapped his fist with his palm.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>The monster could not move his fist. Besides, Sungwoo’s grip began to crush his fist like a hydraulic press, twisting his fingers.<br/><br/>“Argh! How come your power is…”<br/><br/>Confusion spread across his face. He couldn’t believe it. There was a ridiculous situation unfolding at the moment. As a Werebull with a high muscle strength level, he was being held by Sungwoo of the wizard type and could not move at all.<br/><br/>“Without your subordinate spirits and weapons, how can you fight me like this?”<br/><br/>“Why are you thinking one-dimensional? Don’t you think that my subordinate spirits and weapons gave me overwhelming stats?”<br/><br/>“What the heck?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s muscle strength value was 52. In addition to that, he could exert a much stronger grip when he added the correction effect he gained while turning into a human beast. Besides, he obtained the “godly stature,” which reduced the stats of those nearby.<br/><br/>Even though Sungwoo didn’t have fighting skills, he could overpower Werebull.<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo’s right fist struck the monster’s ribs.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuuh!”<br/><br/>Hit by Sungwoo’s body blow, the monster staggered. His punch was so devastating the monster’s intestines ruptured.<br/><br/>Sungwoo continued to throw punches, crushing his ribs. A groan burst out of his mouth. Eventually, the monster kneeled, unable to withstand Sungwoo’s mighty punch.<br/><br/>At that moment, the monster thrust the huge horns on his head, aiming at Sungwoo’s stomach, so Sungwoo had no choice but to move back, letting go of his hand.<br/><br/>“It’s not over yet. I’ve prepared a hidden card for this fight,” shouted the monster.<br/><br/>The monster stepped back and pulled something from his waist.<br/><br/>As expected, it was an ampoule, his main specialty. Then, he took out a syringe and injected it into his thigh.<br/><br/>“Ugh!”<br/><br/>His body began to swell. His bones and his muscles grew. His nails turned long and hard. And the horns on his head began to grow rapidly.<br/><br/>“Kaaaaaaaaaaaah!”<br/><br/>His screaming resonated. The ground he was standing on shook, making a crater in the shape of his hoof.<br/><br/>He opened his red eyes slowly under his huge horns, letting out a hot breath.<br/><br/>“Necromancer… You are done now.”<br/><br/>But Sungwoo smiled slightly, looking at him.<br/><br/>“I think I can obtain nice bones.” </div><h2 id="chapter167">Chapter 167</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Jisu slowly pulled her sword.<br/><br/>“Oh, my God…”<br/><br/>A group of human monsters was strewn here and there under her feet. Behind her were also the corpses of human monsters piled up along the corridor.<br/><br/>The members of the surveillance team snuck out of the classroom at the end of the corridor.<br/><br/>Their eyes popped out when they saw the corpses everywhere.<br/><br/>“So, is the fight over?”<br/><br/>“I can’t believe this. How could he kill all of them in only a few minutes?”<br/><br/>They were also the elite members of the Liberation Guild, but they thought it was unthinkable to survive, let alone fight the monsters, in a situation like this.<br/><br/>However, the power of the Necromancer and his party was beyond imagination.<br/><br/>“It looks like we’re done killing the monsters inside the building, except for one.”<br/><br/>“One more? Where is it?”<br/><br/>Quazzeeeeeek!<br/><br/>At that moment, the door of a classroom broke, and a cloth monster and Hanho appeared, tangled with each other. The cloth monster struck Hanho’s neck with his fierce nails.<br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/>However, his attack was blocked by Hanho’s shield.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhh! You are not done attacking me yet?”<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>While being dragged around, hanging on to the monster’s legs, Hanho stabbed his knife into the monster’s body here and there.<br/><br/>Since the cloth monster had a weak defense, Hanho could strike him down with the dagger.<br/><br/>“It’s me, the strongest thief on earth! Come on! No more?”<br/><br/>Catching his breath, Hanho looked at Jisu. She nodded.<br/><br/>Since Sungwoo killed the monster snipers surrounding the school building, Hanho and Jisu could get rid of the monsters that infiltrated into the building easily.<br/><br/>“Man, it’s really tough to keep this shield continuously.”<br/><br/>He passed over the bodies that covered the floor and looked out the window.<br/><br/>“Is he winning now?”<br/><br/>Outside the building, there was still a melee between the undead and the members of the Evolution Society. But as time passed, the situation was more favorable to the undead.<br/><br/>Sungwoo already dealt a deadly blow to them, so the undead continued to increase in number after they were resurrected, while the members of the Evolution Society kept decreasing.<br/><br/>The enemies didn’t fire silver arrows anymore as if they could not use the arrows indefinitely.<br/><br/>Thud! Kuuuu-gung!<br/><br/>However, the fierce fight taking place in the street beyond the shopping mall was unpredictable.<br/><br/>Kugugugugugugugugu―<br/><br/>Another five-story building collapsed.<br/><br/>“The fight is almost over…”<br/><br/>The fight between the two human monsters was devastating everything in the center of the city.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The Werebull crouched then bounced off the floor. It seemed like a huge rugby ball was flying. However, Sungwoo slipped back to one side and avoided his rush.<br/><br/>Kwaaaaakwang!<br/><br/>The monster hit the truck with his body and blew it away.<br/><br/>Pitter-patter, pitter-patter!<br/><br/>It started to rain.<br/><br/>“Hey, why are you obsessed with running away? Didn’t you just show off your strength before?”<br/><br/>The monster was already holding his head high. After he had injected himself with an unknown drug a little while ago, he seemed to have more than doubled his muscle strength than before.<br/><br/>When he was not pushed around by Sungwoo anymore, he ruthlessly charged at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“I’m stage 4. It’s similar to your Awakening!”<br/><br/>The monster raised his fist and smiled at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>The human monster had a stage instead of a level. The highest stage human monster Sungwoo had dealt with until then was stage 2.<br/><br/>However, it seemed that this monster reached stage 4 by temporarily upgrading after injecting the ampoule. As a result, he was showing terrific strength incomparable to the second stage.<br/><br/>Now, it was raining heavily. The monster once again crouched his body.<br/><br/>Seizing the moment, Sungwoo prepared the Evil Spirit Bomb.<br/><br/>-‘Evil Spirit Bomb’ is embedded in your weapon.<br/><br/>A black wave rose in Sungwoo’s right hand. The moment the monster jumped off the ground, Sungwoo reached out his right hand. The Evil Spirit Bomb spread everywhere.<br/><br/>But the monster threw himself to the right with tremendous agility. The Evil Spirit Bomb missed him and hit the shopping mall.<br/><br/>Ku-o-o-o-o-gung!<br/><br/>The first floor of the shopping mall was completely crushed, causing the whole building to collapse in a minute.<br/><br/>But the monster rolled over the floor, bounced his body up, and rushed at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo went onto the street and hid behind a van.<br/><br/>Bang! Thud! Kuuuuuuuuuuuung!<br/><br/>As if he was a bulldozer, the monster pushed everything standing in the way.<br/><br/>But the monster, who was running wildly, suddenly staggered and stopped all of a sudden.<br/><br/>“Ugh?”<br/><br/>-You have been poisoned.<br/><br/>It was only then that the monster began to consider the existence of the rain that wet his whole body and the clouds floating in the sky. He found the color of the clouds was a bizarre purple hue.<br/><br/>“What kind of trick are you trying to use again?” shouted the monster.<br/><br/>It seemed that the monster thought the raindrops fell suddenly because of unpredictable weather. Since this was the first time Sungwoo used this skill in this fight, the monster obviously didn’t know it was Sungwoo’s new skill.<br/><br/>For Sungwoo, waiting for the opportunity to use it instead of using it recklessly under siege was a good decision.<br/><br/>“Cough! Cough!”<br/><br/>The monster stumbled, exposed to the deadly poison. Although it wasn’t toxic enough to kill him, it was enough to disrupt his physical function.<br/><br/>“It’s over.”<br/><br/>To put an end to this fight, Sungwoo prepared the final move, a new skill.<br/><br/>“Twilight Raid.”<br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/>-Name: Twilight Raid<br/><br/>-Grade: Artisan<br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/>-Consumption: 40 Mana, 20 Souls<br/><br/>*It corrupts the souls accumulated through ‘soul exploitation’ and uses that energy to move at high speed. Inflicts powerful magic damage to the target enemy at the landing point and binds the enemy with the “Ghost Hand” for 10 seconds. (10 minutes of cooldown)<br/><br/>-You have started Twilight Raid.’<br/><br/>Soon, 20 souls came out of Sungwoo’s body. They trembled restlessly and began to spread around Sungwoo’s body. Then, Sungwoo’s body was mixed with a black wave.<br/><br/>Sungwoo turned into a black ghost and flew at a tremendous speed toward the target.<br/><br/>Goooooooooooo-<br/><br/>A black shadow swallowed the Werebull like a hurricane.<br/><br/>“Argh! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>The Werebull struggled in pain, but he couldn’t escape. His heavy body floated in the air and began to be swept away, like a stuffed toy blown away in a tornado.<br/><br/>Gooooooooo!<br/><br/>The black tornado passed tens of meters in seconds. It got out of the alley while moving freely among the vehicles. Then, it landed on the blood-stained ground.<br/><br/>Whooooo-<br/><br/>When the black smoke went away, Sungwoo was standing in the center. And it was the playground of the school.<br/><br/>“Kueeeeeeh!”<br/><br/>The Werebull, which fell under Sungwoo’s feet, could not even raise his body after suffering tremendous damage. But that wasn’t the end.<br/><br/>-You are bound by the “Ghost Hand.”<br/><br/>Twenty black hands came up from the ground. Then, they grabbed his neck and limbs and made it impossible for him to move for ten seconds.<br/><br/>“Do you have another ampoule? Hope not!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo then lifted the Grim Reaper, whose lock was released. He aimed at the monster’s neck, who was completely defenseless.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuuuuh…”<br/><br/>The fight was over.<br/><br/>“Flagbearer!”<br/><br/>“Even our flag bearer…”<br/><br/>The members of the Evolution Society, who were engaged in fierce fighting against the undead, were also on the defensive. And when they witnessed the defeat of the Werebull, their only hope, their morale was completely broken.<br/><br/>“Explode this area! Blow it all away…”<br/><br/>The Werebull muttered.<br/><br/>Since their operation was unsuccessful, the enemies now desperately attempted to target the Necromancer at the risk of their lives.<br/><br/>However, there was no chance that Sungwoo would allow their attack.<br/><br/>He lifted the Grim Reaper.<br/><br/>Wooooooooooong-<br/><br/>At that moment, the space in front of their eyes distorted into an oval.<br/><br/>‘Portal?’<br/><br/>And beyond that appeared a white wolf dressed in black scaled armor.<br/><br/>“Brother!”<br/><br/>“Oh, he’s the white flag bearer!”<br/><br/>It was the human monster with psychometric skills. As soon as he appeared, he stretched his palm toward Sungwoo.<br/><br/>‘Wow!’<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s body floated in the air and was pushed back. He flew about 5 meters and landed on the ground.<br/><br/>‘Damn it! Why did he appear at this moment?’<br/><br/>When Sungwoo started counter-attacking the monster, there was no reinforcement unit to support the monster, so he thought that the enemy troops were all destroyed.<br/><br/>But he didn’t expect at all such a giant monster would appear in this crucial situation.<br/><br/>‘This is a big problem!’<br/><br/>  </div><h2 id="chapter168">Chapter 168</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Sungwoo could not continue the fight any longer.<br/><br/>-Grim Reaper retention time (00:3:30)<br/><br/>-Werewolf retention time (00:4:46)<br/><br/>‘I’ve got only three minutes left. Should I leave this place for the remaining time?’<br/><br/>Then, the white wolf’s body looked somewhat strange.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuh….”<br/><br/>The only thing the monster did after appearing was push Sungwoo aside, but he grabbed his chest and kneeled. He seemed to be in a very bad physical condition.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, what happened?”<br/><br/>“We have to run away right now.”<br/><br/>“Pardon? What the hell is going on?”<br/><br/>Another situation happened before Hanho heard from Sungwoo about what had happened.<br/><br/>Pajeeeeek! Pajeeeeeeee!<br/><br/>Blue lightning fell from the sky. It was not just a single flash, but dozens of lightning bolts rained down like a waterfall.<br/><br/>‘Is it lightning?’<br/><br/>Intense light obscured everyone’s vision. Sungwoo had no choice but to turn his head and close his eyes.<br/><br/>“Argh! What the heck is this all of a sudden?”<br/><br/>“Did anything explode?”<br/><br/>The intense ray of light stopped, and everybody could see again gradually.<br/><br/>Chee- Cheeeee-<br/><br/>And there appeared something where the lightning fell. A man wearing black leather armor and holding a huge wooden cane was standing there.<br/><br/>-Your body function is weakened due to an unknown spirit. (As the two spirits collide, you are affected by a stronger wave.)<br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-5)<br/><br/>“Necromancer, why is it so hard for me to come and see you? You’re the best star on the Korean server, as expected.”<br/><br/>Kangsok Han, the No. 1, appeared. And beneath his feet was a red bear’s head.<br/><br/>“You bet! Hey, why are you making such a big fuss from a distance? We killed this Werebull running wildly with a crazy scream!”<br/><br/>At that moment, the fairy soared from his shoulder and looked around.<br/><br/>“Man, that is a red tongue, Sungwoo!”<br/><br/>The Werebull’s eyes were pointing at the bear’s head under Kangsok’s feet.<br/><br/>Given the reaction, it looked like the cut head was one of the beheaded ‘four human beasts’.<br/><br/>“Hurry up! Shoot your lightning mace!”<br/><br/>At that moment, a huge object began to move on the street facing the school. It looked like a cannon, but Sungwoo noticed it was a dreadful flying weapon that the monsters had been hiding until now.<br/><br/>Wuuuuuuuuuuuh-<br/><br/>Its huge muzzle rotated and aimed at them. A considerable amount of current flew through the long barrel and sparks splattered in all directions. The current concentrated into one sphere. It was the moment when a bullet with destructive power enough to blow up a building was being created.<br/><br/>At that moment, the light flashed. The bullet flew at a speed that human eyes couldn’t follow. Its target was Kangsok.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>But Kangsok didn’t move. All he did was gently lift his cane.<br/><br/>The electric sphere stopped in the air.<br/><br/>“What the heck is that?<br/><br/>“I can’t believe it!”<br/><br/>Kangsok swung his cane. The electric sphere began to rotate at high speed to the right, then in the next moment, it reversed.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The flying weapon was hit by the bullet it shot, thrown back, and rolled across the street before hitting a building.<br/><br/>In no time, Kangsok struck the ground with his cane.<br/><br/>With just one flash, a ray of lightning fell from the sky.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>Its target was the white wolf. The monster hastily lifted his cane and created a protective shield over his head.<br/><br/>Quan-ang! Cheeeeeee-<br/><br/>Kangsok’s lightning and the white wolf’s shield collided. A tremendous amount of energy was scattered in all directions, creating a colorful spectrum.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>The white wolf staggered, as if it suffered huge damage, although he blocked the lightning.<br/><br/>“Who the hell are you…?”<br/><br/>“I’m No. 1 in the Korean Server ranking.”<br/><br/>“You must be Kangsok Han!”<br/><br/>“You’re right. So, I think you and I are going to see some failure today.”<br/><br/>The white wolf turned to Sungwoo, frowning.<br/><br/>“And the Necromancer.”<br/><br/>Although the monster had seen him in his memory, it was his first time encountering the Necromancer like this.<br/><br/>There was murderous energy in his eyes. He suffered lots of damage due to the Necromancer’s attack several times. That’s why he mobilized a formidable force to kill the Necromancer, but he was again defeated.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. Let me look forward to fighting you next time.”<br/><br/>Mumbling like that, the monster lifted his cane. Then, a portal opened behind him.<br/><br/>It was clear that the Werebull and the white wolf were trying to escape through the portal.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo did not intend to let them flee like that.<br/><br/>Sungwoo signaled to Minsok with a glance.<br/><br/>The moment the two disappeared into the portal, Minsok immediately threw a black chain and wound around the ankles of the Werebull. When Minsok pulled it hard, the monster’s exhausted body was dragged out.<br/><br/>“Oh, no!”<br/><br/>The white wolf reached out but it was late. He was already sucked inside the portal. In no time, the portal was closed.<br/><br/>“Krrrrrrrrrrrrr….”<br/><br/>The Werebull blankly looked into the air where the portal existed.<br/><br/>Then a black wolf holding a huge scythe appeared in front of him.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>With the retention time of the Werewolf was over, Sungwoo’s demigod status was canceled.<br/><br/>-Strong power has escaped from your body and all stats decrease for 24 hours. (-10)<br/><br/>And a penalty was given for his gaining such tremendous power for some time.<br/><br/>“Ugh…”<br/><br/>In addition to a sharp decrease in stats, Sungwoo felt tremendous fatigue. He felt like he was going to collapse into sleep.<br/><br/>But he couldn’t. An unexpected visitor, Kangsok, approached him.<br/><br/>“You were hiding something terrific,” he said.<br/><br/>Kangsok was also a demigod. And unlike Sungwoo, the power he gained was not temporary.<br/><br/>“Well, I just stopped by here to say hello to you, but some monsters greeted me instead.”<br/><br/>“You came here to say hello to me?” asked Sungwoo, casting a suspicious glance.<br/><br/>Kangsok chuckled and said, “I’m serious. As far as I know, this is not the only Hell Gate. So, I hope you and I can keep cooperating. Man, I now know why you are so famous. Terrific. I was amazed you killed the monster only two minutes slower than me… Yeah, by a hair’s breadth.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“Of course, I enjoy playing alone, but this game often compels me to socialize with somebody else,” Kangsok said, passing by him.<br/><br/>Then, he whistled while looking at the playground.<br/><br/>“Given the choice, isn’t it good if you have a friend who can keep up with you? Right?”<br/><br/>“What is a Demigod?” Sungwoo asked directly what he was curious about.<br/><br/>“Huh? You just played that role in person, didn’t you?”<br/><br/>“Then, is this your job?”<br/><br/>Kangsok shook his head, and said, “Demigod is not a job. It’s a power you can obtain by satisfying special conditions. I also obtained it by meeting such conditions. You seem to have obtained it temporarily, but I don’t know how to get full strength. You have to know it yourself.”<br/><br/>He smiled faintly. It seemed he didn’t want to talk about it in detail. He said he wanted to keep up cooperation with Sungwoo, but it was clear that he regarded Sungwoo as his rival.<br/><br/>“Well, see you next time.”<br/><br/>“Goodbye! See you soon!” said the fairy, Nabi, flying in the air.<br/><br/>At that moment, his body disappeared into the beam of light. It was his teleport skill.<br/><br/>‘Did he really come here to help me, or did he come to confirm that I also got the demigod status?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo was not sure of that.<br/><br/>Then, another visitor arrived.<br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/>Three helicopters flew in from the northern sky. The Crusader Team arrived a bit later than Kangsok.<br/><br/>“We’re landing! We’re landing!!”<br/><br/>They deployed magic drones in all directions to monitor the whole area, while its crews landed at wide intervals to keep vigilant of their surroundings.<br/><br/>Soon, a helicopter landed, where Junghoon, fully armed, appeared.<br/><br/>While looking around, he looked somewhat embarrassed because he never expected that the fight would be over even before he arrived, no matter how strong the Necromancer was.<br/><br/>“We are very late. Sorry, we couldn’t help.”<br/><br/>“Well, the surveillance team’s intelligence was of great help. Thanks to the helicopter, I can get a ride. I’m a bit tired now.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t hide the fatigue after he escaped from the demigod condition.<br/><br/>But there was one incident after another.<br/><br/>“I’ve got more news for you. ‘Angel’s Stone Statue’ was unearthed in Seoul.”<br/><br/>The traces of the Absolute Race finally appeared. </div><h2 id="chapter169">Chapter 169</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            The Evolution Society was thorough. They aimed precisely at the time when Sungwoo would be the weakest, and they never put in a small number of troops.<br/><br/>Moreover, they even mobilized a flying weapon of tremendous destructive power, called the Iron Mace of Lightning God, to stop Sungwoo from maneuvering in the air.<br/><br/>However, something that not only they but also Sungwoo didn’t expect at all happened consecutively. Sungwoo gained the power of Anubis and Kangsok appeared all of a sudden.<br/><br/>“They left behind a lot of treasure.”<br/><br/>Therefore, most of the weapons they prepared became the loot of the allied forces.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Iron Mace of God of Lightning<br/><br/>-Class: Unknown<br/><br/>-Category: Player’s manufacturing<br/><br/>-Effect: When mana is injected, a powerful ‘lightning bullet’ is formed from the barrel made of the spirit’s core. (Once per minute)<br/><br/>“Oh, we have obtained a flying weapon in addition to the Ballista we got last time. I think we can transport them by helicopter,” said Minhum after checking the items.<br/><br/>In shooting mode, it was about the size of an SUV, but it could be disassembled and folded into a smaller size. There were three iron maces, so they decided to dispatch one in the Suwon village.<br/><br/>“This is not the end of the story. There are all kinds of weapons on those trucks. It seems like they left an entire unit behind.”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sungwoo also gained a lot.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Fighter’s Shackles<br/><br/>-Class: Hero<br/><br/>-Category: Blunt weapon<br/><br/>-Effect: When colliding with an opponent’s weapon 5 times, the ‘Warrior’s Shackles’ skill is activated. It ‘seals’ your own and your opponent’s weapons for 5 minutes.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Mountain Ghost’s Wooden Shield<br/><br/>-Class: Hero<br/><br/>-Category: Shield<br/><br/>-Effect: A shield that ‘disables’ 3 magic attacks is formed. (One hour’s cooldown)<br/><br/>In addition to this, he also acquired two ‘Human Beast Ampoule (Werewolf)’. Since he still had one ampoule, he could use Anubis’ power three more times.<br/><br/>And he even got a new skeleton. It was a 4th stage Werebull with a unique build. Given that the monster pushed Sungwoo when he was in demigod mode with tremendous force, he would be a powerful addition to Sungwoo’s force in the future.<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party took a helicopter and moved to Youngdungpo. Originally, they were going to stop by the Suwon village, but after hearing that the “Angel’s Stone Statue” had been excavated, they changed their destination.<br/><br/>Shortly after they arrived in Youngdungpo, Minhum brought news about the statue.<br/><br/>“The stone statue was found near Mt. Namsan, but since this is an installation object, I hear that it is possible to move it only one day after it was first discovered.”<br/><br/>“Then, how many hours are left?”<br/><br/>“We’ve got 17 hours left. Currently, we’re tightening security around it and preparing to move it. Sorry, but you have to wait a little longer.”<br/><br/>Thanks to this time gap, Sungwoo could take a break. Since he was very tired after being released from the demigod condition, he took a nap.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Shortly after Sungwoo woke up, Hanho brought news.<br/><br/>“They achieved level 8 on average, so they are now celebrating. Since we went there on a mission, we could not take part in their party…”<br/><br/>It was good news that the villagers were level 8 on average. The skills of production players were also improving significantly.<br/><br/>According to the news, the quality of items made by the blacksmiths and tanners has improved day by day, and the menus prepared by the cooks were diversifying. Jungho’s skill in establishing a safety zone also improved a lot.<br/><br/>“It looks like the village is functioning properly now.”<br/><br/>Like Hanho said, the functions like those of the villages in RPG games were being completed one by one. In other words, they were now in the process of securing a space where they could take a rest safely after the dangerous field.<br/><br/>“I also got a call from Kanghwa Island. It seems that the movement on the Chinese side is unusual again. The number of their appearances on the coast is increasing, and even within the Chinese 2-server community, lots of people are talking bullshit, arguing they have not yet finished conquering the Korean peninsula.”<br/><br/>On Kanghwa Island, a Chinese server player was held captive, so they could check their movement through the Chinese community.<br/><br/>“Really? It seems Taiwan is stabilizing to some extent. So, they began to entertain the idea of occupying the Korean peninsula.”<br/><br/>Although the Chinese players failed to occupy Kyodong Island and the Korean peninsula, they successfully took over Taiwan.<br/><br/>Even so, they could not even imagine going back to mainland China, so it was possible that they still regarded the Korean servers as a relatively easy target.<br/><br/>“Will they come back?”<br/><br/>“Not for the time being.”<br/><br/>Since they were defeated so thoroughly twice, they would not come back right away.<br/><br/>So, making such a fuss within the Chinese community seemed just to be a common diplomatic provocation. Namely, they kept reminding their players of the external enemies while solidifying the internal unity, so they could show to the outside that they were still active and strong.<br/><br/>“Even if they have completely occupied Taiwan, they will have to stay there for some time. In the meantime, we have to hurry up the formation of the alliance to find stability before preparing for a bigger fight.”<br/><br/>However, stability was not something they could get just by wishing for it.<br/><br/>The game once again began to change drastically.<br/><br/>-As of now, the mainstream ‘CHAPTER 2-1: The balance patch is urgent!’ has ended urgently.<br/><br/>* The rankings of the warlord boss monster removal<br/><br/>kor-157: 3<br/><br/>Kangsok Han: 2<br/><br/>DOCTOR-000: 2<br/><br/>Yoon Choi: 2<br/><br/>Hyonmin Jang: 1<br/><br/>DOCTOR-001: 1<br/><br/>Remote Villager: 1<br/><br/>Chairman of the Reconstruction Alliance: 1<br/><br/>Masan Sword King: 1<br/><br/>(A total of 15 warlord boss monsters)<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>“The game started again?”<br/><br/>Another new mainstream has begun.<br/><br/>[Mainstream start guide]<br/><br/>-CHAPTER 3: Select camp<br/><br/>Dear all survivors of the Korean server! I am happy to be able to share this news although you have gone through a long ordeal.<br/><br/>The mainstream so far has been a tough event where you have to fight against increasingly stronger monsters and survive, but now, the moment has come to determine your fate.<br/><br/>The two Absolute Races who are leading the game are waiting for you to join their faction.<br/><br/>From now on, please choose one of the two races, Angel and Devil, and continue the fight for the survival of Earth!<br/><br/>[Caution (Important)]<br/><br/>You can sign a contract with the faction through the ‘stone statue’ of the Absolute Race.<br/><br/>You can receive a ‘Promotion Quest’ through the stone statue, and when you clear the quest, you will receive a certain grade of ‘epaulet’.<br/><br/>A ‘Faction Quest’ is given to each faction, and a great reward is given to all of them upon clearing it.<br/><br/>A number of new large dungeons will be added.<br/><br/>The event will last for 7 days and the schedule may change, depending on the game situation.<br/><br/>Finally, the Absolute Race came to the surface, and the selection of the factions began.<br/><br/>“Angels and Demons? Then, shouldn’t we join the Angels unconditionally? It seems that few people choose to be the Devil’s faction.”<br/><br/>Hanho tilted his head. As he said, the images of the two words were completely different.<br/><br/>“Are the angels and devils the same as we know?”<br/><br/>“Oh, that’s a good question.”<br/><br/>“Well, they are making fun of us now. It seems meaningless to judge good or bad about this.”<br/><br/>Are they really the angels and demons from humanity’s view of religion?<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought they were not. In his mind, they were close to the concept that people were divided into a blue team and a white team in a simple competition.<br/><br/>“Then, are they aliens? I’ve been thinking about this, but it’s clear that aliens are making fun of us. Maybe they’re voting for us like Superstar 101. Sungwoo, they might have formed a fan club for you. If that’s the case, you owe a lot to Orun! Sungwoo, summon Orun more often, will you?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Of course, Sungwoo could not agree with him.<br/><br/>A little later the object in question, the Angel’s Stone Statue, arrived at Youngdungpo. </div><h2 id="chapter170">Chapter 170</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party were waiting for the statue on the rooftop of Youngdungpo Station with the Crusader Team.<br/><br/>“Eagle-3 is approaching Youngdungpo to deliver the parcel. One minute before its arrival.”<br/><br/>“All drones, stay on alert! Snipers, go back to your positions!”<br/><br/>The transport of the Angel’s Stone Statue was completed under strict security. Except for the Crusader Tam, the Wide Area Surveillance Team, and Sungwoo, few players knew about the statue.<br/><br/>Minhum explained this security measure.<br/><br/>“Since the Mainstream just started, most of the leading groups will try to get this statue first. They won’t dare to attack us, but right now I think it’s necessary to keep it secret.”<br/><br/>At this point, Sungwoo could confirm that Junghoon was trusting him because he didn’t keep such important information from him.<br/><br/>‘Junghoon puts the interests of establishing the coalition before his interests.’<br/><br/>To him, the biggest support for the establishment of the coalition was the Necromancer. Therefore, Sungwoo realized Junghoon was trying to make him his surefire ally.<br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/>Soon, the sound of the helicopter rotor was heard from the northern sky, and a helicopter appeared carrying a container wrapped in a green tent.<br/><br/>“Good! Slowly descend!”<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuuuung―<br/><br/>Then, as soon as they carefully put it down on the rooftop of Youngdungpo Station, agents approached from all sides, unwrapped the tight strings, and removed the tent. They broke the chain that sealed the entrance.<br/><br/>The door opened, and a faint white figure was seen inside the container in the dark.<br/><br/>“Let’s go.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Junghoon went inside first.<br/><br/>-You are facing the trace of the Absolute Race, “Angel’s Stone Statue”.<br/><br/>The pure white stone statue began to glow.<br/><br/>“It’s just like an angel.”<br/><br/>As Junghoon said, it was a stone statue of a female angel with pure white wings, without any special features.<br/><br/>Her smooth body in a long cloth garment was revealed with a sword in her right hand and a crown in her left hand.<br/><br/>“The sword and the crown…”<br/><br/>Usually, the objects on a statue symbolized something.<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not infer the meaning of the two items immediately.<br/><br/>-Put your hand on the statue.<br/><br/>The same message came to mind in front of Sungwoo and Junghoon.<br/><br/>And they put their hands on it at the same time.<br/><br/>[Angel’s Camp: Contract]<br/><br/>2)’Faction Quest’ is given.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A defense increase (+10%). Buff is given.<br/><br/>You can get a large amount of extra gold by killing a player in the Devil’s camp.<br/><br/>Junghoon frowned after confirming the message.<br/><br/>“It seems they are trying to divide the players and pit them against each other. Well, they used to in the past, but now they are openly forming factions.”<br/><br/>“I think so.”<br/><br/>As predicted, they were supposed to be divided into two camps for this fight.<br/><br/>-Would you like to choose the Angel faction? (Y/N)<br/><br/>* After selecting a camp, you cannot “withdraw” for a certain period. (7 days)<br/><br/>* If you leave the faction in the future, a ‘penalty’ may be given for angering the angel.<br/><br/>Junghoon agonized over the message for a moment because he had to choose between the two factions.<br/><br/>But he wondered if it was right to choose the Angel faction. He hesitated because he couldn’t make a definite judgment, for what’s certain for now was that he obtained the statue of the angel first.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>On the other hand, a completely different message appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/>-You cannot select the Angel faction.<br/><br/>* You have a dirty item now. (Crystal of chaos) Destroy the item, remove the trait of ‘chaos’ from it, and contact it again.<br/><br/>‘The trait of chaos?’<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Crystal of chaos.<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: Orb<br/><br/>-Effect: Gives its owner the trait of ‘chaos.’ Increases mana (+500), Recovers mana (+250%), Steals mana and health at the same time (3%)<br/><br/>It was an item that Sungwoo obtained by combining the tears of the sea spirit and the bloodstone of the demon. This item gave him a new trait that was neither demon, nor an angel, but ‘chaos’.<br/><br/>‘Do I have to give it up?”<br/><br/>It was a very valuable item for that. By combining two legendary grade items, he was given a ridiculous option. It has been an important force to him like a fountain that never dried up.<br/><br/>‘Do I have to give up on this because of the Angel faction that I don’t know anything about? No way!’<br/><br/>Seongwoo removed his hand from the statue. At that moment, the message about the selection of a faction disappeared, and the eyes of the Angel Statue seemed to stare at him.<br/><br/>And a new message appeared.<br/><br/>[Hidden Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: Third choice<br/><br/>-Type: Remove of target<br/><br/>-Goal: Destroy the statue of the Absolute Race (0/3)<br/><br/>-Reward: Establish a third faction.<br/><br/>*Who is the one who is trampling this land? You must think about who is the real enemy before making the choice.<br/><br/>What is certain is that at least the ‘Absolute Race’ is not on your side. Their purpose is not to pursue humanity’s prosperity. Rather, they want to achieve their ambitions by thoroughly destroying human beings.<br/><br/>You, who can escape from the beasts of the Absolute Race by possessing the trait of ‘chaos’! You will have to stand on your own feet if you want to preserve your race and win the fight.<br/><br/>* When you accept the quest, you will anger the Absolute Race.<br/><br/>‘Hidden Quest? Third faction?’<br/><br/>As expected, there was a variable in this mainstream. The ‘chaos trait’ Sungwoo had obtained a long time ago presented a new path.<br/><br/>-Would you like to accept the hidden quest ‘The Third Choice’? (Y/N)<br/><br/>This was a huge danger and opportunity. So far he has never declined a path with both sides like this. So, Sungwoo immediately clicked Y. And his choice was like him crossing a river of no return.<br/><br/>-You brought out the anger of the Absolute Race.<br/><br/>-All players in the Absolute Race faction are given a ‘wanted order’. (Target: kor-157)<br/><br/>* Angel’s faction bounty: 20,000,000 gold<br/><br/>* Devil’s faction bounty: 15,000,000 gold<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, what the hell is this?” asked Junghoon, distorting his face.<br/><br/>“Now, they are asking me to kill you.”<br/><br/>Junghoon had already chosen the Angel faction.<br/><br/>Looking at Junghoon quietly, Sungwoo slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“Our situation is getting complicated.”<br/><br/>“What the hell is this about?”<br/><br/>Junghoon made a tough expression. He grew alert, though he didn’t know the exact situation.<br/><br/>“Please tell me. You know I can’t ignore this kind of system message. What you mean by ‘a complicated situation’…”<br/><br/>“Then, let me do it simply.”<br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo said that, the Grim Reaper appeared in his right hand. He swung the Grim Reaper without any hesitation.<br/><br/>“What the heck are you doing now?”<br/><br/>At that moment, the Angel’s Statue was split in half and a light came out.<br/><br/>-Third option: Destroy the statue of the Absolute Race (1/3)<br/><br/>“What have you done now?”<br/><br/>“This is the third choice.”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“Come to think of it, the way to control this game is always in the third choice. Junghoon what would be our ending after we have been played around by an unidentified being, be it an angel or a demon? Can we have a happy ending?”<br/><br/>Not a linear way, but a hidden way, that is, the third way has always been the right answer of attack. However, it also caused greater resistance.<br/><br/>-Angel faction registers the sacrifice of your life as a ‘ Faction Quest’. In the future, all angel players will be obligated to hunt you.<br/><br/>-Angel faction increases the bounty for you.<br/><br/>*Angel faction’s bounty: 50,000,000 gold<br/><br/>“What the hell did you do now…?” Junghoon still couldn’t hide his embarrassment because he was given a faction quest to kill Sungwoo.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo calmly looked at the Angel’s Statue and found something sparkling in the fragments.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Angel’s Wing Sculpture<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: Disposable item<br/><br/>-Effect: When you use it, you can move to ‘Angel’s ‘ within a certain range. (1 time)<br/><br/>* The demon faction can’t use this.<br/><br/>-Description: When the statue is destroyed, it is used for the final emergency exit.<br/><br/>“Man, I can move to another statue?”<br/><br/>Maybe there was a function embedded in this sculpture, so he could move from one statue to another. If the rivalry between factions intensified, it was possible that they would try to destroy each other’s statues.<br/><br/>“By the way, where is the other statue?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo once heard there was only one place. Sungwoo remembered the time when he read the memory fragments of Gen. Jigong.<br/><br/>“Taiwan!”<br/><br/>There was Angel’s Statue in the place where the Red Revolutionary Army, namely the pirates existed.<br/><br/>In other words, it was possible that Sungwoo could get rid of the second statue and the pirates at once. </div><h2 id="chapter171">Chapter 171</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Sungwoo’s destruction of the statue of the Absolute Race caused a bigger stir than expected. The Absolute Race not only offered a bounty for Sungwoo but also issued an order to kill him.<br/><br/>[Server Quest]<br/><br/>*This quest was given to the entire server by the Angel camp. You can choose one of the three options below:<br/><br/>* When dealing with the target person, you receive the ‘Blessings of the Judge’ buff from the Angel camp. All stats increase significantly over some time. (+5)<br/><br/>* In the case of non-affiliated players, the ‘rank score’ will be taken into account when signing a contract with the Angel camp.<br/><br/>* Only those who have made the greatest contributions can receive one ‘Holy Gift ‘ from the Angel camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Support the 3rd camp (Protect kor-157)<br/><br/>* You will be allowed to choose a third faction.<br/><br/>* You will incur the wrath of the Absolute Race.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bystander<br/><br/>* Not applicable.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, these options are not good.”<br/><br/>Hanho looked around with anxiety. Youngdungpo was the territory of the allied forces, but the atmosphere now was much different from before because the players of the Liberation Guild located on the roof showed a somewhat different attitude.<br/><br/>‘Even I will covet the bounty.’<br/><br/>The bounty put forward by the Angel camp was 50 million gold. Moreover, three options appeared. They had to choose one of them by all means.<br/><br/>However, depending on the choice, the results presented were so different. In short, the options openly encouraged them to kill the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“What is this holy gift? Besides, all stats increase by 5? Isn’t it the same as the effect of increasing by 6-7 levels?”<br/><br/>“The rank score of the Angel camp? I don’t know what it is, but I think it’s amazing…”<br/><br/>But no one dared to come forward.<br/><br/>Finally, Junghoon walked out from them and said, “Sungwoo…”<br/><br/>There was puzzlement and anger on his face at the moment.<br/><br/>“I really can’t understand what you did a moment ago, and it’s unacceptable.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not afford to explain it fully because of the urgency of the situation.<br/><br/>“I can feel something, but I can’t tell you with confidence, someday I can explain it.”<br/><br/>“I believe in what you feel, but this is different. If you make somebody we can’t deal with an enemy like this, I really can’t work with you in the future.”<br/><br/>“I understand.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not blame Junghoon, and it would not be strange at all for Junghoon to criticize Sungwoo in this situation.<br/><br/>Sungwoo also felt like opposing the Absolute Race was like fighting against God.<br/><br/>Furthermore, when Junghoon and Sungwoo put their hands on the statue at the same time, Junghoon made a contract with the Angel camp. Nonetheless, Sungwoo broke the statue, which was a great shock and a serious development for Junghoon.<br/><br/>“And we may go further and have to fight you,” said Junghoon.<br/><br/>Even his reaction like this was fully understandable.<br/><br/>At that moment, the Crusader Team approached Sungwoo slowly. It looked like they were about to pull out their swords and fire their crossbow at him.<br/><br/>Jisu, too, spread her feet a little wider and put her hands on her sword.<br/><br/>It was a close call.<br/><br/>Junghoon continued, “But let me choose Option 3 for now. Sooner or later, I will switch my decision to Option 1 or 2. I hope I can find a reason for choosing Option 2.”<br/><br/>When he said that, the Crusaders took a step back. The tension eased a bit, but the atmosphere was still cool. What would have happened if Sungwoo and his party fought the Crusader Team whose stats increased by 5? No matter how strong Sungwoo was, he could not be sure of his victory.<br/><br/>“Thank you for trusting me.”<br/><br/>“I just got a penalty from the Angel camp for choosing Option 3. Anyway, I’m afraid I can’t help you any further,” said Junghoon.<br/><br/>“Sure, let me head to Suwon.”<br/><br/>“Yes, go ahead.”<br/><br/>For now, they had to split. It was natural that it was awkward for them to work together in such a situation. Even if Junghoon tolerated Sungwoo, Youngdungpo, where numerous player groups gathered, was never safe because some of them might rebel against Junghoon.<br/><br/>But the situation in the Suwon village would be different. It was something like a shelter that Sungwoo built in preparation for contingencies like this.<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party escaped from the roof and quickly descended the stairs.<br/><br/>He was thinking of summoning Bone Wyvern after getting out of the area.<br/><br/>If he summoned Bone Wyvern on the rooftop visible from everywhere, he could be hit by an unexpected attack. They left the Youngdungpo Station building quickly.<br/><br/>“There are people everywhere. I can feel their intense gaze,” said Jisu.<br/><br/>As she said, they could feel the hostile gaze of many people around them. Some of them were peeking out of the alleys and windows, and others were staring at them outright. Somebody was even fidgeting in a place invisible from others.<br/><br/>“Well, I don’t think they will attack us. That guy over there seemed to have lifted his crossbow! Hope he’s not firing.”<br/><br/>Most of them were helped by Sungwoo, so they even regarded him as a hero, but they were swayed by the enormous bounty put forward by the Absolute Race.<br/><br/>“They know they can’t attack us because of their vain desire.”<br/><br/>Even if they coveted the bounty, they could not dare attack the Necromancer.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, if somebody had the guts to mount an attack out of greed, there was a possibility that the rest of them would run wildly to attack him. So, it was imperative for Sungwoo and his party to leave as soon as possible.<br/><br/>“Ugh!”<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo felt something hot coming up from his chest.<br/><br/>‘Oh no… what the heck?’<br/><br/>It got hot little by little, then it was not hot.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, what’s the matter with you?”<br/><br/>“Nothing. Move quickly!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was bothered a bit by that, so he just focused on the situation he was facing now.<br/><br/>They slipped out of the second iron fence and out of the official territory of the Liberation Guild.<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned a Bone Wyvern immediately. But at that moment, Jisu turned and looked over the iron fence.<br/><br/>“Rotor sound…”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“I can hear the rotor sound, but this is not a drone. They turned on the engine of the helicopter.”<br/><br/>It was a bad sign.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, when Sungwoo got on the Bone Wyvern and looked down, three helicopters were rising over the malls in front of Youngdungpo Station.<br/><br/>‘Reconstruction Alliance….’<br/><br/>That place was where the military helicopters of the organization called the “Reconstruction Alliance” were located.<br/><br/>Sungwoo had once encountered its members at the corridor of Youngdungpo Station before. He clearly remembered that they expressed a hostile attitude toward him at that time.<br/><br/>But he never expected they would openly attack him.<br/><br/>Woooooooong!<br/><br/>Their helicopters began to speed up, and their fuselages tilted forward. They were faster than expected.<br/><br/>Furthermore, an unusual wind blew from somewhere and began to crush the wings of the Bone Wyvern, which slowed down its flight significantly.<br/><br/>“There is an exorcist on the helicopter!”<br/><br/>The wind exorcist on board the helicopter was changing the direction of the wind. So, it seemed impossible for Sungwoo to give them the slip. Sungwoo had no intention of running away.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was determined to deal with them harshly because they would cause big trouble later if he didn’t crush them now.<br/><br/>“Hanho, you said before you liked helicopters or teleports better than Bone Wyvern, right?”<br/><br/>“Pardon? Why are you saying that all of a sudden?”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo asked suddenly, Hanho felt ominous.<br/><br/>At that moment, black smoke rose from both sides of the Bone Wyvern, and nine zombies were summoned. Minsok and Orun also appeared behind them.<br/><br/>“How about going there and taking them by yourself?”<br/><br/>“I beg your pardon?<br/><br/>“The zombie monster will get you on board.”<br/><br/>“Man, are you crazy? Sorry if I told you so!”<br/><br/>In the meantime, the distance between the helicopters and the Bone Wyvern narrowed.<br/><br/>Sungwoo could even see the pilot’s face. And someone in the lead helicopter stuck out his head.<br/><br/>Ping!<br/><br/>Jisu moved in front of Sungwoo and pulled out her sword.<br/><br/>Jumping, she cut something out of the air.<br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/>An incredibly fast object was split in half and its fragments were stuck in her left clavicle.<br/><br/>It was an arrowhead the size of a finger.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the arrowhead slowed down when she blocked it with her sword. Otherwise, she must have suffered a fatal injury.<br/><br/>“Be careful, it’s a sniper’s fire!” </div><h2 id="chapter172">Chapter 172</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Jisu adjusted her combating posture quickly then swung her sword twice, cutting two arrows in the air.<br/><br/>They were enforced arrows. Small arrows were added to the barrel before firing. They were much faster and more powerful than normal arrows, but that wasn’t the end.<br/><br/>“It seems that the arrows are flying fast because of the accompanying wind.”<br/><br/>There was a reason why they were pursuing the Bone Wyvern. Since they had a couple of wind exorcists, they could freely control the air fight in their favor.<br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t send the zombies because the enemies were dominating the flow of air.<br/><br/>Peeeeng!<br/><br/>This time two enforced arrows were fired from both sides at the same time.<br/><br/>Jisu held her breath, ready to beat them back.<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is that?”<br/><br/>Just like a fish going up a river, the flying arrows were changing their direction by drawing a curve up and down as well as left and right, controlled by the wind exorcists.<br/><br/>Since Jisu could not predict which way the arrows would fly, she could not strike them back.<br/><br/>The wind exorcists intended to change the direction of the wind exactly at the moment Jisu swung her sword.<br/><br/>However, Jisu moved faster and threw the spirit of her sword by using her swordsmanship skill, intercepting the arrows before the wind exorcists could change their direction.<br/><br/>“Phew…”<br/><br/>Jisu was ahead of the enemies in predicting each other’s coming attack.<br/><br/>Shortly afterward, the Bone Wyvern flew among the apartments, lowering its altitude rapidly. The helicopters followed the Bone Wyvern. It was as if the fighters engaged in dogfighting were sliding into a canyon.<br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/>A black shadow quickly fell from one side of an apartment and collided with the helicopter in the rear.<br/><br/>Bang! Kugugugugugugu―<br/><br/>The helicopter lost its balance at the impact, then nosedived after scratching the outer wall of an apartment roughly. There was the sound of a big explosion.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The object that collided with the helicopter was Ghoul King.<br/><br/>The giant monster jumped from the roof of the apartment and struck the helicopter’s tail.<br/><br/>“Nice! It was a good operation!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned Ghoul King on the roof of the apartment then had the Bone Wyvern flow low to lure the helicopter into the trap.<br/><br/>Ghoul King climbed up the outer wall of the apartment like a spider and began to hunt for the tails of the other two helicopters. Naturally, the enemies had no choice but to focus on the rear for fear of Ghoul King’s ambush from behind.<br/><br/>“Jisu! Hanho! Now is the time to take them!”<br/><br/>“Pardon? What do you mean?”<br/><br/>“When they are focused on the tails of the helicopters, you have to take over the helicopters! Have them get off the helicopters except for the pilots!”<br/><br/>“I’m ready!” Jisu loosened her shoulder.<br/><br/>“What? What are you ready for? Are you guys crazy?”<br/><br/>At that moment, nine monster birds grabbed Jisu, Hanho, Minsok, and Orun by the shoulders. Then, they flew straight towards the two helicopters.<br/><br/>“Hey! You crazy monster birds!” The enemies hurriedly aimed at the monster birds, but the five birds blocked their attack while Orun and Minsok rushed into the helicopters first.<br/><br/>Of course, Jisu and Hanho were dispatched last for safety reasons. To take over the helicopters, somebody was needed to threaten the pilots.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>One Bone Wyvern and two helicopters landed at Hwaseong Square in Suwon.<br/><br/>Hanho walked out with a sullen expression and opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I sincerely and seriously picked No. 1 from that server quest. I was embarrassed this time.”<br/><br/>“Well, I was trying to get you a helicopter that you like.”<br/><br/>Kyongsu and Inho approached Sungwoo and his party.<br/><br/>Lots of villagers were on standby, fully armed, behind them.<br/><br/>“Welcome back.”<br/><br/>“As you can see, no one has chosen No. 1.”<br/><br/>The villagers greeted Sungwoo gladly, although he had a huge bounty on his head. It was natural they welcomed him back. They survived because of his help from the beginning of the game, and they have been relying on him for survival since then.<br/><br/>“I thought you would be okay, but I’m really glad you are okay. We have tightened the security just in case.”<br/><br/>“Thank you. You did very well, as I requested. You did a great job!”<br/><br/>Kyongsu upgraded the villagers’ average level to 8, but Kyongsu and Inho seemed to be more concerned about what was happening right now than their level upgrade.<br/><br/>“By the way, there is a big uproar on the community bulletin now! There are so many social media whores who say they will kill you.”<br/><br/>“Even some extreme guys are attracting argos by turning on the broadcast. I’ve never seen so many broadcasts turned on at the same time like this. They called you a hero, but now they are hell-bent on killing you!”<br/><br/>Like they complained, the Korean server’s community and private broadcasts were overflowing with those who said they would kill Sungwoo by choosing No. 1 on the server quest.<br/><br/>“You don’t have to worry about it,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>He thought their behavior was extremely normal. As soon as a person who has been enjoying great popularity became a problem, a large number of unspecified people would attack him in the real world. That was happening to him now.<br/><br/>Sungwoo easily saw this phenomenon on the internet before its demise. Therefore, it was not correct to think that the Korean server turned against him by judging the current community atmosphere alone.<br/><br/>“The moment they notice the turn of events, they will be quiet again.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was confident that he could change the situation soon.<br/><br/>“Ugh!”<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo felt a hot pain again. It was caused by something deep inside his pocket, a small object hidden there.<br/><br/>“What’s the matter with you?”<br/><br/>He pulled it out of his inner pocket.<br/><br/>The small object emitted a brilliant light.<br/><br/>“Oh!”<br/><br/>“What is that? Is it a seed?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know about it, but it seems like a great thing.”<br/><br/>The seed of the world tree was once again shining.<br/><br/>-By achieving certain conditions (the third choice), you have obtained qualifications to become the ‘founding father’ of the new camp.<br/><br/>* If you plant the seed of the world tree now, it will grow as a “god tree” that will bless your camp.<br/><br/>* To achieve this, you must complete the quest ‘The Third Choice’ and succeed in ‘creating a faction’.<br/><br/>“God tree?”<br/><br/>Now, the seed was in the safest place, and it was the perfect time to plant it.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Where should he plant the seed of the world tree, a huge tree with magical power?<br/><br/>Since it was hard to move once he planted it, he had to be very careful.<br/><br/>‘Previously I would have considered planting it in other areas outside of Suwon village…’<br/><br/>It was dangerous for him to go far because he didn’t know when and where the players could ambush him.<br/><br/>‘In the current situation, there is no other place than one near the village.’<br/><br/>Considering that he had to protect it until it grew, Sungwoo thought the more closely he planted it near the village, the better.<br/><br/>‘Didn’t I get the warning that if the world tree was destroyed, it would cause disaster? I need a place that is easiest to defend with all our strength rather than hide it.’<br/><br/>So, he decided to plant it in the square in front of Hwaseong Palace, right in front of the city art museum, the main building of the village.<br/><br/>Sungwoo used a large skeleton to create a ‘flower bed’ on one side of the square.<br/><br/>He scraped off the sidewalk blocks and marble from the ground and dug and carried the soil from Mt. Paldal, located next to the village. Since he didn’t know how big the world tree would grow, he had to prepare enough soil for its roots to grow.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>The undead skeletons could work tirelessly, and when the players in the village helped, a small hill was created in a day.<br/><br/>“Leave some flat ground inside the square. It should be used as a helicopter landing area,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/>When the world tree grew large, it might not be possible for aircraft to take off around it, but for now, he needed space for a helicopter or Bone Wyvern to fly.<br/><br/>“Before planting the tree, we will tighten the security around this area. As a matter of fact, we were expanding the watchtower to the surrounding area,” said Kyongsu.<br/><br/>Inho added, nodding at him, “We are checking the safety of shopping malls and installing facilities on the rooftop. I think it’s good to make this neighborhood like a castle by blocking the alleys.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo agreed with that idea.<br/><br/>“It seems like a good idea. I would also like you to find a place where you can install the flying weapon, ‘Iron Mace of Lightning God,’ that I sent here recently.”<br/><br/>“How about installing one of the two flying weapons on the top of Mt. Paldal? I think we can get something like camouflage material from a nearby military base.”<br/><br/>“Sounds like a plan.” </div><h2 id="chapter173">Chapter 173</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Kyongsu and Inho were carrying out the necessary job with a sense of responsibility. While Sungwoo was away, they were taking care of the survival groups in Suwon and playing a new leadership role.<br/><br/>“Captain, I don’t think there are any new monsters nearby.”<br/><br/>Also, the former biker gang members such as Taesung and Yujin regularly patrolled the village and its surrounding area.<br/><br/>“Well, there are still goblins hiding in the mall and Kobolds crawling out of the basement, but it seems that Direwolf is almost gone…”<br/><br/>While managing stores in Suwon Station, they kept acquiring various items, among which were two magic drones, an important surveillance tool, and seven radio items.<br/><br/>They cleared the vehicles left unattended on the roads.<br/><br/>Finally, they made sure all the players should sign a “Vault of Oath” to raise funds to run the facilities.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Vault of Oath<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: Finance<br/><br/>-Effect: Some of the gold earned by the ‘contracted players’ is automatically deposited.<br/><br/>-Description: You can ‘register a contract’ by placing your palm on the safe. The vault owner can set a ‘collection rate’, and the amount of gold earned by the contractor is automatically deposited into the vault.<br/><br/>* Collection rate: 10%<br/><br/>* Registered contractors: 226 people<br/><br/>* Current Gold: 1,655,048<br/><br/>“It looks like their living environment is getting better, although we can’t enjoy it because we keep moving around outside Suwon all the time,” said Hanho, looking around the village.<br/><br/>Now, the Suwon village was no longer a temporary shelter, but it was growing as a large community towards their common fate.<br/><br/>Sungwoo stood at the center of the huge flower bed.<br/><br/>The time had come for him to plant the seed of the world tree. The villagers lined up around him and watched.<br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled out the seed of the world tree. That small object shone so brightly that it was difficult to describe. Then, a little sigh came out of the villagers.<br/><br/>“That’s the world tree?”<br/><br/>“Wow, I feel it’s different from typical seeds.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo put the seed in a small hole and carefully covered the soil.<br/><br/>Soon, golden light started to soar into the sky, and Sungwoo slowly stepped back.<br/><br/>-You have planted the seed of the world tree (Shindansu).<br/><br/>-A spiritual being begins to take root in this land.<br/><br/>[Hidden Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: For the Spiritual Tree<br/><br/>-Type: Protection of Goal<br/><br/>-Goal: Protect the world tree until it grows to a certain size.<br/><br/>-Reward: First Fruit, Permanent Buffs<br/><br/>*It is a world tree, a transcendental being, but its sprouts are still helpless. That is why the monsters who have sensed the existence of the world tree will come to this place in droves to covet its spirituality and nobility. Defend the tree by all means until it grows enough to protect itself.<br/><br/>* The world tree can take monsters as its nutrients. The more monsters you defeat, the faster the world tree grows.<br/><br/>* If the target (world tree) is destroyed, it causes irreparable disaster.<br/><br/>As expected, nothing was easy. The world tree was not just something that Sungwoo could raise by simply planting it in a sunny place and giving it water.<br/><br/>-This quest applies to party players in the same way. (Total 226 people)<br/><br/>“So, we also should protect the world tree?”<br/><br/>“What the heck? Does it mean that the monsters are rushing toward us now?”<br/><br/>And everyone who witnessed this scene, and the players in the village, were also given the same quest. It meant that the level of the difficulty of this quest was very high.<br/><br/>‘Something changed a moment ago.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked around, standing on the flower bed. Although he was not sure, the atmosphere in the area was very serious.<br/><br/>He felt as if some terrible energy was coming to this place. His foresight was almost right.<br/><br/>“Look over there!”<br/><br/>On the rooftop watchtower on a nearby shopping mall, the security guards began to move busily. It was an ominous sign. And one of them shouted to the square.<br/><br/>“Monsters are popping up from the 3 o’clock position!”<br/><br/>The security guards on the lookout tower on the other side also seemed to catch some unusual movement.<br/><br/>“The Kobolds are crawling out of the sewer on the road!”<br/><br/>“A lot of them, not just one or two!”<br/><br/>An unexpected defense game began.<br/><br/>“Everyone, move!”<br/><br/>The players of the village achieved level 8 on average, so they already had significant combat experiences. The days when they were so incompetent they had to rely on Sungwoo for survival were gone a long time ago.<br/><br/>“Snipers, go to your assigned watchtower!”<br/><br/>When Inho shouted, those carrying long-range weapons moved quickly.<br/><br/>As if they had lots of practice for contingencies like this, they scattered in an organized way and went up to the roof of the building.<br/><br/>“Tanks! Bring the barricades!”<br/><br/>The buses parked at the back of the square moved, and their appearance was unusual.<br/><br/>On one side, thick sheets of steel were welded to the buses to defend against outside attacks, while the other side was completely open.<br/><br/>“It’s called a Castle Wall Car. When we line up the buses, we can defend a large area,” Kyongsu explained.<br/><br/>As the rebuilt buses lined up with the sides attached with iron plates facing toward the enemy, they became like a castle wall.<br/><br/>“Spearmen and shooters, get on the buses!”<br/><br/>They could freely respond to the enemy’s assault by coming and going freely through the opposite side of the open holes of the buses. They could also climb onto the ceiling of the bus by using the ladders. They produced various weapons for defensive purposes like this.<br/><br/>“What a great strategy! Whose idea was this?” asked Hanho in admiration.<br/><br/>“There are many talents in the village. As you know, we have been forbidden to go outside for a while after the Youngdungpo terror. So, while we were confined here, we devised lots of stuff to defend against attackers.”<br/><br/>Thanks to such thorough preparation, the monsters could not attack the players directly, let alone approach the sprout of the world tree.<br/><br/>“Goblins are coming! Sweep them away with AOE magic!”<br/><br/>“Kobolds have appeared in the 1 o’clock position!”<br/><br/>The monsters around the village had been completely swept away a long time ago.<br/><br/>At best, only some goblins and Kobolds were hiding in the underground, so even if they were rushing toward them, there was no way their defensive line could fall.<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned 27 undead to help the village players, but that’s all. Since the players were strong enough, Sungwoo didn’t have to mobilize any more of his forces, but a problem was growing elsewhere.<br/><br/>“Wow, can you see him in the picture? The Necromancer is right here! When he first met the Youngdungpo Prosecutor, this was the place in the picture where the two shook hands.”<br/><br/>Three players hiding in an alley were filming something somewhere. Numerous monsters were rushing toward where their cameras were directed. Of course, it was the Suwon village.<br/><br/>“Suddenly, the monsters just rushed in, and a battle broke out! What the hell is going on?”<br/><br/>They were conducting a personal broadcast titled “Chasing the Necromancer.”<br/><br/>“I don’t know, but it seems like the Necromancer is hunting without stopping. Gosh, that’s why he is confronting the Absolute Race. Honestly, I admit he is cool.”<br/><br/>“I admit, too. But I also admit I chose the No. 1 option of killing the Necromancer because I didn’t know.”<br/><br/>At first, there were only about a hundred viewers, but soon after the news about the Necromancer was captured on the screen, a significant number of viewers began to watch the broadcast.<br/><br/>Then, the hosts got excited and started to raise their voices.<br/><br/>“After the Absolute Race put up a huge bounty for the Necromancer, those who said they would hunt the Necromancer mushroomed everywhere throughout the server, right?”<br/><br/>“Yes. Let me tell you something. The Necromancer is right here. Why don’t you come and challenge him?”<br/><br/>They went up to the roof of a building and captured more details of the Necromancer and the Suwon village on the screen.<br/><br/>“Look over there! He is the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>Shouting like that, they captured and zoomed in on a certain place where the Necromancer was standing on a heap of earth.<br/><br/>“Pardon? Why are you guys urging me to fight him like this? I didn’t say I’d kill the Necromancer.”<br/><br/>“Right! We have just found the place where the Necromancer disappeared. It’s up to you, self-proclaimed Necromancer Slayers, what to do with him.”<br/><br/>A little later three ghouls under the control of the Necromancer appeared on the roof.<br/><br/>Right after that, the broadcast was suddenly stopped.<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is that!”<br/><br/>“They’ve come!”<br/><br/>“Sorry, we have just…” </div><h2 id="chapter174">Chapter 174</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>However, the brief broadcast revealed the location of the Necromancer, which made the community and private stations make a big fuss again.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, they’re crazy about killing you everywhere. As many as five private broadcasts are open with the keyword Necromancer.”<br/><br/>Most of the threads about the Necromancer on the community bulletin included threats and bluffing to kill and chop up the Necromancer. Some of them even plotted to attack him by recruiting a party. The central figure making such a plan was affiliated with the “Reconstruction Alliance,” which suggested he would carry out the plan someday.<br/><br/>However, what attracted the most attention among the personal broadcasts was a player named “Terror Kim,” who swayed a large amount of power in the Anseong area.<br/><br/>-[LIVE] Let me make a bombshell announcement. I’m going to blow up the Necromancer with a nuclear bomb. (23,166 Watching Now)<br/><br/>On the screen of the broadcast appeared a man with a strong build. His upper body was naked and covered with all kinds of tattoos.<br/><br/>“I am ‘Terror Kim’ of the Siheung area! I’m currently ranked 10th at level 16.”<br/><br/>Having said that, he bit a cigarette. Then, he lit the cigarette and continued.<br/><br/>“Necromancer, do you like bombs? Uh? You seem to enjoy playing your corpse explosion game all the time, right?”<br/><br/>Then, he raised his left hand. At that moment, a round object appeared in the air.<br/><br/>It was a transparent ball containing a green liquid.<br/><br/>He picked it up and threw it at the building behind him.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>Then, an explosion broke out and the whole two-story building collapsed. He made a strange smile, with the dust pouring over his head.<br/><br/>“By the way, I’m the first person to make such a bomb. My job is ‘terrorist’, and I made the bomb with my weakest skill.”<br/><br/>He blew out cigarette smoke towards the camera.<br/><br/>“Phew… But I have a bomb that will take me 24 hours to complete. I’m going to prepare it and move to Suwon to hunt you, Necromancer. The bounty on your head is mine.”<br/><br/>Then, he pretended to cut his neck with his thumb.<br/><br/>“Choose whether you want to run away or if you want to be killed by the bomb. I’ll blow up the whole area around you. The bounty is mine.”<br/><br/>Having said that, he began to laugh like crazy. The broadcast ended with that. It felt like a warning of terror Sungwoo had seen somewhere.<br/><br/>“It looks like he has thrown down a gauntlet. It sounds like a bluff, but what if his threat is real? How can you stop his bomb?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was immune to the flames, but the explosion was a different story.<br/><br/>He could be killed if something went wrong.<br/><br/>And the problem was that it wasn’t just Sungwoo that Terror Kim was aiming for. He could stage an indiscriminate terrorist attack and bomb the entire village.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Sungwoo was always on standby near the flower bed.<br/><br/>When night came, the waves of monsters quieted. Of course, it didn’t mean they took a break because night came. It meant that all the monsters in the area had disappeared.<br/><br/>If so, it could mean that more powerful monsters were coming from a distant place.<br/><br/>“We have not had any crisis until now. We have gained a lot by hunting miscellaneous monsters around the area,” said Kyongsu, briefing Sungwoo about the recent developments.<br/><br/>Sungwoo said, “But you must not let down your guard because it’s not just monsters that are trying to kill us.”<br/><br/>“Are they players, then?”<br/><br/>“Although most of the warnings posted on the community bulletin and the broadcast are just bluffs, who knows when some of them will translate their words into action?”<br/><br/>The Reconstruction Alliance members had already attacked Sungwoo. Normally, they would not have dared to do so, but after they got buffs called “Judge’s Protection” and all stats were raised by 5, they were more confident now.<br/><br/>“It’s crazy.”<br/><br/>“It’s annoying.”<br/><br/>-The sprout of the world tree is growing. (11%)<br/><br/>When he looked with the lantern, he noticed a small leaf growing. Just catching Goblins and Kobolds didn’t seem to make a big difference.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo? What happens next if you create a third camp?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo shook his head, and said, “I do not know.”<br/><br/>“Ah…”<br/><br/>“But I have no choice. I can only assume it will lead to a good ending.”<br/><br/>“What do you mean by a good ending?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded. There is an ending to this game. He’s never seen the prophetic stone featuring angels and demons, but he thought they didn’t seem to lead to a good ending.<br/><br/>“Wouldn’t it be a better ending for us to arrive on our own feet than to see the ending while following the unknown whims of the angels and demons?”<br/><br/>Angels and demons didn’t think of humans as partners. Given the information that had been obtained to date, they were trying to give humans grades and punish them.<br/><br/>Although Sungwoo made the ‘third choice’ because of unexpected conditions, he would not have blindly believed angels and demons even if he had not made the choice.<br/><br/>“Ending? If we go to the end, will we find out who created this game?” asked Kyongsu. But their conversation ended there because of a huge explosion.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>There was a huge explosion in a shopping mall building on the right side of the plaza.<br/><br/>Orange flames were everywhere in the dark.<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is that? Damn it! Launch the drone right now!”<br/><br/>Shouting like that, Kyongsu went down the mountain.<br/><br/>Starting at that explosion area, Sungwoo lifted the repeating crossbow.<br/><br/>Kugugugugugugugu―<br/><br/>In no time, the central part of the shopping mall collapsed. As if somebody put his hand in the middle of a sandcastle, there was a big hole in it. Black shadows began to appear in between the building debris.<br/><br/>“Hahahaha! Hahaha!”<br/><br/>A shadow walking from the center with a burst of hearty laughter opened both hands.<br/><br/>“Hahaha! Did you think I would come here in 24 hours just because I gave you 24 hours of preparation? You should have prepared everything in advance! It’s too late for you to run away!”<br/><br/>It was Terrorist Kim, the terrorist who gave a warning broadcast that morning. A camera operator was standing next to him. They were broadcasting everything right now.<br/><br/>“Now, I don’t want to tell you a long story. See the climax! Everyone, see the final moments of the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>Terror Kim lifted something in his right hand.<br/><br/>“This is a skill that can blow up an entire apartment building!”<br/><br/>It was a cylindrical object filled with a red liquid. A faint light came out from his hand and flowed into the cylinder. In no time, the red liquid began to turn black.<br/><br/>– Caution! A ‘dark red storm’ starts in the affected location.<br/><br/>“It’s over!”<br/><br/>Then, Terror Kim threw it at Sungwoo. An unknown object flew in a straight line toward Sungwoo. He already said what it was. It was an explosive skill that could blow up a whole apartment building.<br/><br/>“All will die! Lie down!”<br/><br/>But at that moment, Sungwoo did not move. Sungwoo lifted the shield he prepared under his feet. The cylindrical object burst and the black liquid was sprayed in all directions. However, the moment it touched the shield, a protective shield spread from the shield.<br/><br/>The black liquid evaporated.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>That was it. There wasn’t anything like a huge explosion or flashing light.<br/><br/>The terrorists lying down on the floor raised their heads.<br/><br/>“What the heck happened?” Sungwoo said gently lowering the shield, “You said that this bomb was not an item but a skill, right?”<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Bandit’s wooden shield<br/><br/>-Class: Hero<br/><br/>-Category: Shield<br/><br/>-Effect: A shield that ‘disables’ 3 magic attacks is formed. (One-hour cooldown)<br/><br/>It was an item Sungwoo captured from the “Red Rider” of the Evolution Society.<br/><br/>This was the Red Rider’s shield that easily defended against Sungwoo’s new skill, ‘Evil Spirit Bombing’.<br/><br/>“Now, let’s change the topic of your broadcast,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Damn it! How could you block my skill?” screamed Terror Kim.<br/><br/>Then, the terrorist lifted a bomb as if he were desperately resisting.<br/><br/>At that moment, however, three arrows were stuck in his forearm.<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>He fell immediately, and Sungwoo slowly approached him.<br/><br/>The camera operator standing next to the terrorist was completely frozen on the spot.<br/><br/>Sungwoo grabbed the camera and made the cameraman film him.<br/><br/>“Let me make a major announcement.”<br/><br/>The number of viewers started to rise dramatically. </div><h2 id="chapter175">Chapter 175</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>“I’m going to promise you three things from now on. This promise applies to all players on the Korean server,” Sungwoo slowly said. “I’m going to go and search for all the guys who publicly announced that they would kill me, and kill all of them one by one.”<br/><br/>As soon as he said that, Sungwoo pulled out something. It was a hand cannon.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>Terror Kim’s head was blown away with only one explosion. That terrifying scene was captured fully on the camera screen. Sungwoo slowly loaded the hand cannon.<br/><br/>“And I’m going to create a new organization and kill everyone under the control of Angels and Demons.”<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>This time, the man standing next to Terror Kim fell. Soon, the players from the village began to flock behind Sungwoo’s back. Hundreds of them fully armed were captured in one camera angle.<br/><br/>“But if you choose a third camp with me, it will be a different story.”<br/><br/>The Necromancer, who was the subject of criticism and the images of a prey for a very short period of time, revealed his true colors, and imprinted some strong images on the whole Korean server. In other words, he sent a strong signal that their choice of the Absolute Race might be wrong.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, the Necromancer was known to have hurried out of Youngdungpo Station immediately after the Absolute Race set a price on his head. In other words, he chickened out and fled the area.<br/><br/>Having heard that news, lots of people thought that the Necromancer would collapse soon. No matter how strong the Necromancer was, wasn’t his rival the Absolute Race?<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Angel camp even gave lots of buffs to those who helped them. That’s why they were reckless enough to announce on the community bulletin that they would kill the Necromancer.<br/><br/>However, The necromancer was alive, contrary to their expectations.<br/><br/>“Argh! Please help me!”<br/><br/>“Oh please help me! I just did what I was told to do.”<br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/>That night, Sungwoo sent out a broadcast featuring the slaughtering of Terror Kim Terror and his followers. He massacred a whopping 25 men.<br/><br/>The viewers of that broadcast exceeded 150,000, and there was a big uproar on the community.<br/><br/>And those who mocked the Necromancer a little while ago also reacted immediately.<br/><br/>-[LIVE] Broadcast to apologize for provoking the Necromancer’s anger / We’re sorry. We made a mistake. (3,226 Watching Now)<br/><br/>“Sorry! Sorry! Necromancer! I think I was crazy all of a sudden at that moment…”<br/><br/>The reason they reacted like that was because the Necromancer, who was up and running, openly reiterated that he would get rid of all the players who were hostile to him.<br/><br/>And the Necromancer’s announcement could never be taken lightly.<br/><br/>“It was really me who had them do an apology broadcast. I’m not trying to water down your serious message. I really repent what I did to you! If you are Necromancer’s colleagues and watching this broadcast, please convey my sincere message to him!”<br/><br/>There were a series of broadcasts in which the terrified players offered public apologies to the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“Ah, I am willing to choose the third camp in the future!”<br/><br/>It looked like a ridiculous situation, but in hindsight, it showed how overwhelming the Necromancer’s power was.<br/><br/>Didn’t he wipe out all the enemies without any single failure until now? Moreover, the fact that most of those who were hostile to him were killed was enough to scare the life out of them.<br/><br/>[432] Is it only me who is deploring this ridiculous situation?<br/><br/>-Author: Miss Choi │ Visit: 54,433<br/><br/>*As soon as a bounty on the Necromancer’s head was announced, you guys chose No. 1 option and made all kinds of bluffing with threats to kill the Necromancer, then you guys are begging for your lives and offering apologies like this?

You don’t appear on the monitor screen often. Anyway, it was so moving to watch you live on the broadcast. I fully support you!<br/><br/>─ Yasuo 1: Tut, tut. We have to kill all the social media trolls!<br/><br/>All the voices and comments criticising the Necromancer on the community and the broadcasts disappeared quickly. Almost all those who simply posted malicious comments disappeared, and even those who were seriously aiming for a bounty on his head didn’t openly reveal their intentions.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, it was Junghoon who found himself in the most difficult position. Since he chose the Angel camp, he had no other choice but to break up with Sungwoo. But that’s not only what he wanted, but also something he didn’t expect at all.<br/><br/>He was sitting in the conference room with his deputy Minhum.<br/><br/>“I don’t know if it is right to declare the creation of the new alliance without the Necromancer.”<br/><br/>“I’m worried about it, too. We can’t deny the fact that the reason why the survivors relied on our Youngdungpo group in anticipation of the establishment of the alliance was because we had the full backing of the Necromancer.”<br/><br/>In fact, it was because of Sungwoo’s suggestion that they started to form a huge organization called the “Metropolitan Players Association”. And they could create it because Sungwoo had been blocking external threats until now.<br/><br/>Moreover, many of the players who came to Youngdungpo after hearing the rumors about the establishment of the new alliance expected that they would be protected by the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“Commander, should we revise the plan?”<br/><br/>But Junghoon shook his head and said, “We have to go through some trials, but we can’t give up now. Please hurry up to discover a new statue by expanding the surveillance team. If we can’t find another statue, we may be pushed aside by other groups.”<br/><br/>“If that’s the case, are you going to eventually be against the Necromancer? As you know, he already openly threatened to kill both the Angel camp and the Devil camp,” Minhum asked anxiously.<br/><br/>Since the Crusaders watched the Necromancer fighting the formidable enemies up close, they knew better than anyone else that they could not beat the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“No, that’s not what I mean.”<br/><br/>Actually Junghoon was aware the Crusaders were not powerful enough to confront the Necromancr.<br/><br/>He said, “Sungwoo is not a humane person, but he is a reasonable man. In other words, he understands my message, so if he can’t be our friend, we should not make him our enemy.”<br/><br/>“Do you mean we should conduct diplomacy with him?”<br/><br/>Junghoon nodded. Since Sungwoo had an independent force, Junghoon thought it was necessary for the two sides to conduct friendly diplomacy toward each other.<br/><br/>“Minhum, the family members of the skeleton who is accompanying Sungwoo are here.”<br/><br/>In fact, Sungwoo once asked him to take good care of Minsok’s family.<br/><br/>“Oh, you are right!”<br/><br/>“Take care of them well and keep in touch with them. If they ask you to send them to Suwon, you can decline their request by telling them it’s dangerous in Suwon now.”<br/><br/>Of course, Junghoon wanted to use the Minsok’s family as something like a bargaining chip to negotiate with Sungwoo. In some respects, Jungwoo could create a situation favorable to him.<br/><br/>“By the way, the Angel camp will continue to issue the quest to catch the Necromancer. If you don’t carry it out, won’t they give you a bigger penalty?”<br/><br/>“Well, let me wait and see if they can really do that.”<br/><br/>Junghoon chose No. 3, ‘Bystander,’ in the ‘Server Quest.’ As a result, he got a penalty, which decreased his stats temporarily.<br/><br/>Although he has not suffered any big damage until now, he and the Crusaders can lose lots of power if he keeps getting penalties.<br/><br/>‘I have to be prudent. I should not lose either the Angel camp or the Necromancer for now.’ </div><h2 id="chapter176">Chapter 176</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>In Junghoon’s opinion, the two Absolute Races, Angels and Demons, could only present the direction of the game but could not become its key players. On the other hand, the Necromancer was the strongest key player.<br/><br/>So, striking a subtle balance between the two sides was what Junghoo had to do for now.<br/><br/>‘To make it happen, I must not be pushed around by either side. Yeah, I have to be stronger first.’<br/><br/>Soon, he found hope. A member of the Crusader Team, currently belonging to the Wide Area Surveillance Team, brought some good news to him.<br/><br/>“We have intelligence that our members have found an Angel’s statue in the Kimpo area.”<br/><br/>Junghoon sighed in relief at the news because if he didn’t have a statue, he was most likely to be eliminated from the current mainstream. If that really happened, he could not found a coalition of the survivors’ groups.<br/><br/>“What a relief! Please carry out the plan to transport it safely under tight security.”<br/><br/>“Yes, we will. By the way, Commander, the statue we have found this time is a bit different from the one we found before. I hear that this statue has four wings.”<br/><br/>“Four wings?”<br/><br/>“The statue we found last time had only two wings.”<br/><br/>Junghoon didn’t know what the difference between these two statues was, but it seemed that the Angels’ statues had grades. As a result, Junghoon became more anxious.<br/><br/>‘If I can gain more power with this statue, they will give me more responsibility.’<br/><br/>Currently, there was only one thing the Angelic race wanted.<br/><br/>‘They want me to kill the Necromancer, but they could pressure me more if I have more responsibility.’<br/><br/>Junghoon now felt he was at a crossroads of great choice.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>-The sprout of the world tree is growing. (77%)<br/><br/>As time passed by, a group of powerful monsters began to come from a little further distance. A group of red orcs and trolls that survived after the appearance of the warlord monsters began to pop up.<br/><br/>Ooooooooooh!<br/><br/>“Three trolls are coming from the right!”<br/><br/>“Have a shield on the tank and block them with Faint skills!”<br/><br/>The more terrifying monsters approached, the more the players’ ability to cope with the monsters enhanced. The players of the same occupation grouped to fight together to receive the optimal synergy effect.<br/><br/>Thud-<br/><br/>“Well done!”<br/><br/>“Fire a burst at the fallen monster!”<br/><br/>They were now gaining enormous EXP while blocking the monsters behind the solid wall instead of moving around in dangerous areas to search for the monsters.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Sungwoo stood next to the world tree, which was now as high as his waist, and watched the fighting between the village players and the monsters in the area. Sungwoo’s subordinate spirits supported the players, but it was the players who were doing most of the battle now.<br/><br/>‘This is an opportunity for me to build a strong army while protecting the world tree. And based on that, I can form the third camp.’<br/><br/>Just like the village itself became a haven for Sungwoo, it could be a greater help to him in the future, and when the day came when he could not hide the world tree, he would need the troops to protect the world tree.<br/><br/>Kyongsu and Inho approached him after their battle entered a lull.<br/><br/>“As things stand now, I think the players will reach level 9 on average in a couple of days. Among them, those with the highest level will be 15.”<br/><br/>“As expected, Suwon is much safer and more comfortable than I thought.”<br/><br/>The village players reached level 8 on average only recently, but they are now on the verge of reaching level 9.<br/><br/>Considering that the 50 members of Junghoon’s Crusader Team were level 11 on average, the village players’ current level was quite high.<br/><br/>“Thanks for your hard work! Given that the players suffered no casualties, I think you guys really worked very hard to train them.’<br/><br/>-The sprout of the world tree is growing. (99%)<br/><br/>The first stage of growth of the world tree was already at an end.<br/><br/>‘It’s around the corner!’<br/><br/>A little later, the stems and branches of the world tree began to grow rapidly, emitting a golden color.<br/><br/>-The world tree has reached the ‘first stage of growth’.<br/><br/>* Permanent stat increases are given to all players in the quest. (Muscle strength +1)<br/><br/>* Blessings are given to all players in the quest for 24 hours. (All acquisition rate increase +20%)<br/><br/>The young world tree grew as high as two meters, about the height of a typical adult male.<br/><br/>It didn’t look much different from a typical tree, but Sungwoo realized that some mysterious phenomenon was taking place inside the thin bark.<br/><br/>‘I can feel some energy.’<br/><br/>He could feel the white rays of light extending from the roots rising up the stem, passing through its branches and flowing through all the leaves, and this unidentified ray of light was getting stronger as the world tree grew.<br/><br/>That wasn’t the end.<br/><br/>Woooooooong- Woooooooow-<br/><br/>Light began to focus on the thickest branches of the world tree. The light was condensed in one place and formed a circular object.<br/><br/>‘It’s a fruit.’<br/><br/>Soon, a golden fruit was born. It was smaller than he thought. At best, it was about the size of a finger joint.<br/><br/>-The world tree bore its first fruit.<br/><br/>* Only the one who is qualified can take the fruit.<br/><br/>Of course, the one who was now qualified to take the fruit was Sungwoo. So, he took the fruit boldly.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: The first fruit of the world tree<br/><br/>-Grade: Myth<br/><br/>-Category: consumption<br/><br/>-Effect: Unknown<br/><br/>-Description: This is a fruit containing the mysterious power of the world tree. You can gain special power if you eat it.<br/><br/>The item he obtained from the world tree could give him special power. So, he immediately put it in his mouth without any hesitation.<br/><br/>There was no time for him to feel what it tasted like because it instantly disappeared in his mouth like melting snow.<br/><br/>Now, he felt something spreading all over his body, starting from his mouth.<br/><br/>-By eating the first fruit, you are now ‘linked’ with the world tree.<br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/>-Name: World Tree (Link)<br/><br/>-Grade: MAX<br/><br/>-Category: Passive<br/><br/>-Consumption: 0<br/><br/>*You have been connected to the world tree by eating its first fruit. Whenever the world tree grows, you can get a certain number of stats.<br/><br/>+ Return: No matter where you are, you will return to the world tree. (Cooldown: 24 hours)<br/><br/>‘Man, I can’t wait to see it growing bigger and bigger!’<br/><br/>Whenever the world tree grows, would Sungwoo enjoy an increase in his stats?<br/><br/>He didn’t know how much that would be, but he was sure it would be a huge advantage because it meant he could increase his stats twice as many as others.<br/><br/>Moreover, the “return” skill also seemed to have an infinite range of applications because he could use it not only as a simple movement technique but also for escape purposes in case of an emergency.<br/><br/>‘If it really happens, I can mount an attack on the pirates in Taiwan and escape.’<br/><br/>He obtained an Angel’s Wing Fragment when he destroyed the Angel’s Statue. It was an item he could use to move at once to an Angel Statue in another area.<br/><br/>In other words, he had a way to ambush the pirates in Taiwan before they noticed it.<br/><br/>However, currently, Taiwan was like a pirate’s lair. It would be easy for him to get in, but if something went wrong, there was no way for him to escape, so he couldn’t do it hastily in the past. Now, things have changed.<br/><br/>‘When the world tree stops growing and stabilizes, let me go and attack them in Taiwan.”<br/><br/>Since such a tremendous reward was given, it was far from easy to protect the world tree.<br/><br/>-The quest ‘For the Spiritual Tree-2’ begins.<br/><br/>* The energy of the world tree spreads farther and attracts more powerful monsters.<br/><br/>The quest was not over yet, and it was getting more and more difficult.<br/><br/>At that moment, the guard on the rooftop announced that sign.<br/><br/>“Magic Drone #2 has found something in the northern sky! Please check!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Kyongsu hurried up to the rooftop. </div><h2 id="chapter177">Chapter 177</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>A large TV was installed on one side of the watchtower, and a scene of a magic drone in action was displayed on the screen.<br/><br/>“You can look here. It’s about five kilometers away.”<br/><br/>What the wizard pointed at was above an apartment complex between a clear sky and thick clouds.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Something was flying from there.<br/><br/>“What is that?”<br/><br/>It looked like a huge flying monster with long veiled wings.<br/><br/>“They’re Wyverns!”<br/><br/>Someone muttered. As he said, the flock of Wyverns filled the sky.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo? Can we confront them? I know you killed several of them before. But it looks like there are too many Wyverns.”<br/><br/>Like Kyongsu just said, Sungwoo confronted only three Wyverns in the past. It was also a very tough job for him at that time. If he had not driven them away, he would have plunged into a dangerous situation.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo seemed to have full confidence this time. At that moment, Kyongsu felt it might be his illusion that he sensed something like expectations in Sungwoo’s face.<br/><br/>“You are right, Kyongsu. It was a close call at the time.”<br/><br/>“Then, how are you going to deal with them this time?”<br/><br/>“But the situation is different now.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled out a Human Beast Ampoule.<br/><br/>Perhaps he could dominate the sky of the Korean server.<br/><br/>Wyverns are powerful monsters comparable to the raid boss monsters.<br/><br/>“They’ve arrived!”<br/><br/>Their appearance alone was enough to terrorize the opponents, but there was a real reason why people feared Wyvern. It was because dozens of such terrible monsters flew in groups for hunting. As a result, they didn’t end up hunting their prey simply. Once they attacked any group, the attacked group could not avoid extinction.<br/><br/>“Well, how many Wyverns are there this time?”<br/><br/>They were a disaster far beyond fear.<br/><br/>The Wyvern group was called the ruler of the Korean server, and such a title has never changed since the opening of the Korean server.<br/><br/>Only once the Necromancers left a blot on their notoriety, but there was no doubt that even the Necromancer was only the Wyverns’ helpless prey.<br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr―<br/><br/>Such dreadful monsters appeared above the village of Suwon.<br/><br/>“Why are they circling in the sky like that? I just feel dizzy,” Hanho said.<br/><br/>Like he said, they didn’t rush to target their prey. No, they didn’t.<br/><br/>They became impatient to attack their prey at the bloody smell and the smell of human flesh coming up from the ground, but they wouldn’t dare fly down until the boss Wyvern issued an order.<br/><br/>“Because there is a more terrible monster reigning over those terrible monsters.”<br/><br/>His name was Wyvern Alpha Male.<br/><br/>It was the boss monster that led the strongest monster group on the Korean peninsula.<br/><br/>It is twice as large as a typical Wyvern. Even though he has the title of “boss” among Wyverns, nobody has ever witnessed him directly attack his target. In other words, it is a monster never known clearly to the outside world.<br/><br/>‘Wyvern Alpha Male doesn’t come down even after the other Wyverns begin hunting their prey.’<br/><br/>Just like he did at the battle at Kimpo Airport, he was always flying at the highest altitude even when other Wyverns were attacking their prey. Since the other Wyverns brought prey to him, the boss monster only focused on commanding other Wyverns and monitoring the situation.<br/><br/>‘So, I have to make him fly down, then never fly again. That’s my goal,’ Sungwoo thought to himself.<br/><br/>Like he did at the Kimpo battle, the boss monster would fly down and launch an attack when the other Wyverns under his command were put in a dangerous situation. But when the situation became more urgent and dangerous, he would choose to retreat, but Sungwoo had no intention of expelling them or letting the boss monster withdraw them.<br/><br/>‘I must catch all of them and kill them this time.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo wanted to make all of them fodder for the world tree. He decided to do his best for the growth of the world tree.<br/><br/>“We’re all set,” said Kyongsu, approaching Sungwoo.<br/><br/>This time, all the players in the village were supposed to be mobilized. The players crouched on the rooftop, alleys, or under trees and waited for the Wyverns to approach.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Soon, long and dark shadows began to come down, a sign that the Wyverns’ wings came down closer. It also meant the boss monster had issued an order.<br/><br/>Woooooooooooooong!<br/><br/>Their fluttering wings turned into strong winds and swept overhead. Their attack began.<br/><br/>Their target was the world tree growing in the square of the village in Suwon, but Sungwoo was standing in the middle of it.<br/><br/>Watching him, the village players were in a tense mood.<br/><br/>“Whew…”<br/><br/>“Everybody, stay calm! We have to wait.”<br/><br/>The Wyverns began to move, but it was clear that they were not yet given a clear order.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was standing under the world tree without moving at all while raising his head toward the Wyverns.<br/><br/>Five Wyverns lifted their claws over his head. In a few seconds, the world tree would be uprooted and Sungwoo would be torn apart if he didn’t do anything.<br/><br/>At that moment, however, Sungwoo raised his right hand. Kyongsu and Inho straightened up as soon as they noticed it.<br/><br/>“Fire Iron Mace!”<br/><br/>“Lift the curtain!”<br/><br/>He issued the order according to the prepared operation.<br/><br/>Clang! Clang!<br/><br/>The next moment, two flickering spheres fired up from somewhere on Mt. Paldal. They were the Iron Maces of the Lightning God Sungwoo captured from the Evolution Society. He had built battlements somewhere on Mt. Paldal early on.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The formidable bullet soared in the air before nose-diving and colliding head-on with the Wyvern.<br/><br/>Keeeeeeeeck!<br/><br/>The two Wyverns at the forefront stopped fluttering their wings, then rose upside down as if to bounce off. Then, they immediately fell free from the sky.<br/><br/>“They were killed on the spot!”<br/><br/>Two Wyverns died instantly. Indeed, it was a huge blow for the Wyvern group. The Ballista used by Red Orcs also inflicted fatal damage on the Wyverns, but could not kill them immediately.<br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/>However, only two of them were killed. The three Wyverns in the rear row did not stop and continuously descended toward the world tree. The world tree was so attractive and lured them in.<br/><br/>“Now is the time to attack!”<br/><br/>At that moment, players lying face down near the world tree took off the blue curtains installed behind the world tree.<br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/>There were Ogre Skeleton and four troll skeletons gathered inside. They were hiding there, covered with plastic curtains.<br/><br/>Ogre Skeleton moved first. He stretched out his right arm and used the skills built into his bracelet.<br/><br/>Dark blue lightning was shot into the sky. Three Wyverns were pushed back, electrified by the current. That wasn’t the end. The troll skeletons standing behind him pulled huge slingshots.<br/><br/>Tu-woong! Tu-woong!<br/><br/>This time the village players poured out from around the world tree. They were waiting for the perfect time to attack, lying down in the parked buses and under a pile of dirt.<br/><br/>This was the perfect moment for their attack.<br/><br/>“Use magic!”<br/><br/>“Target their eyes and heads!”<br/><br/>The players launched all sorts of attacks on the Wyverns that were flying around in great confusion. Their cooling skill hit their wings and hindered their flight, and the flames soared and burned their corneas. Then, dozens of arrows were struck in their relatively thin stomachs.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>Sungwoo also fired a series of arrows. Wyverns couldn’t fly again after being hit by all sorts of magical attacks.<br/><br/>-You have earned 694,031 gold by hunting Wyvern.<br/><br/>-You have earned 665,444 gold by hunting Wyvern.<br/><br/>-You have earned 614,511 gold by hunting Wyvern.<br/><br/>-You have exploited their souls. (Cumulative: 38)<br/><br/>“We have hunted them!!”<br/><br/>“More Wyverns are coming behind you! Hide, everyone!”<br/><br/>While the players were realigning their formation, Sungwoo picked up the Grim Reaper he had been put down on the ground and removed his hood. Then, a black wolf’s face was revealed.<br/><br/>-Grim Reaper retention time (00:48:44)<br/><br/>-Werewolf retention time (00:49:02)<br/><br/>When his Anubis status was canceled, the cumulative souls disappeared, so Sungwoo obtained the power of demigod early to hunt the monsters around. That’s how he exploited their souls.<br/><br/>“Isn’t it time for the Wyvern Alpha Male to come down now?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo raised his head and caught a huge shadow hidden in the light of the sun.<br/><br/>He felt the Wyvern Alpha Male’s altitude was lower than before. The Wyverns flying around him dispersed from side to side.<br/><br/>As expected, the boss monster was coming down.<br/><br/>“Yeah, come on!” </div><h2 id="chapter178">Chapter 178</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sungwoo calculated the number of souls he exploited. He had 38 so far. Those were enough for now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo realized that the first five Wyverns that came down were sort of an advance party to size up his forces on the ground. When Wyvern Alpha Male descended, more than twenty Wyverns followed him. Like a flock of crows, they nose-dived toward the prey on the ground all at once. Some of them aimed at the Iron Maces of the Lightning God hidden on Mt. Paldal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang! Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The reloaded Iron Maces of the Lightning God fired another giant bullet. Two Wyverns fell helplessly from the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the Wyvern herd didn’t retreat. Once they landed on the mountain, they began to push their way through the forest by breaking trees with their huge legs. They found the battlements installed with the Iron Maces of Lightning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it, I got caught!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment one Wyvern was about to crush the iron mace, a long arm was stretched out from the trees and grabbed the Wyvern’s ankle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was Ghoul King. Sungwoo had arranged for Ghoul King to hide behind the battlement just in case of the Wyverns’ attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ghoul King grabbed the Wyvern’s legs with both hands and stuck him to the ground. Then, the monster climbed on top of the Wyvern and bit through his neck ruthlessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeh! Kueeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>After that, dozens of ghouls charged at the other Wyverns and climbed on their backs. Huge stones were being thrown at them from the trees all at once by the troll skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo shouted, “Everyone, move among the trees! If you are among the trees, they won’t be able to attack you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Wyverns who attacked the battlements could not help but be beaten unilaterally by the undead moving through the trees. The Wyverns couldn’t counter-attack the undead efficiently unless they made Mt. Paldal forest-barren.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But what mattered was not the battlement. It was a place around the world tree where the Wyverns concentrated their attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment Sungwoo showed any weakness in the security around the world tree, the Wyverns could uproot the world tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players defending the world tree looked up at the sky and were stunned at the overwhelming number of Wyverns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, there are too many…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have to defend this tree, no matter what. As long as the Necromancer doesn’t retreat, he will find the way to defeat them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in the affected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Death Response’ begins in the affected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo mobilized all his subordinate spirits to fill the area around the world tree. As a result, troll skeletons held up bone shields and thoroughly defended the world tree. The players hid under the world tree and prepared magic and arrows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t use the “poisonous cloud” because of the players, but he was thinking of refraining from using the skill because of its bad effect on the world tree anyway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get ready to spell all the magic!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Load arrows!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo prepared the most powerful skills for the moment when the Wyverns approached the world tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– ‘Evil Spirit Bomb’ dwells in your weapon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo exploited four souls to fire the Evil Spirit Bomb. The black spheres soared before falling and exploding right above the heads of the Wyverns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kugugugugung-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The black wave from the bombs crushed their heads. When the three Wyverns stumbled, the players cast all kinds of magic on them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s defense strategy was simple. He would seek to defeat the Wyverns one by one with a concentrated attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 566,454 gold by hunting the Wyverns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And this defense strategy was the right way to deal with Wyverns because of their characteristics. The reason why Wyverns were so strong was that they were flying monsters, and they moved in groups before attacking their prey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wonderful! Our strategy works!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The Wyvern on the left is staggering! Fire intensively!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Compared to large monsters such as Ogre or Drake, the Wyverns’ defense was not very good. Three of them were quickly thrown onto the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was focusing on something elsewhere: the approach of Wyvern Alpha Male. He would be different from other Wyverns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wyvern Alpha Male stretched his wings then raised his neck. The moment he opened his mouth, other Wyverns nearby flew away from him. They knew something dangerous was going to happen soon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everybody, be careful!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo lifted his bone shield, and Wyvern Alpha Male spewed something out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Poohahahahaha!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a green liquid. The substance spilled over the troll skeletons. Then, toxic smoke rose above them, melting their bone shields instantly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, it’s an acid attack!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everyone, get away from the attacked skeletons!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The reason why the acid attack was so dreadful was that the acid solution would remain unless it was neutralized. As a result, even if the skeletons kept regenerating, they melted as long as there was acid around them. The skeletons were now unable to move or attack, but Sungwoo could not do anything about them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It was time to replace them anyway.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo lifted the Grim Reaper. At that moment, the troll skeletons showered with acid collapsed, and other subordinates filled their void.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were the Wyverns killed on the ground. They raised themselves, revealing their strong bones instead of scales and flesh.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, they must be on our side, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crazy…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In an instant, twelve Wyverns were standing in the place of the melted troll skeletons. Nine monster birds also appeared behind them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stretched out the Grim Reaper toward the sky. Bone Wyverns started fluttering their wings at once. A great gust blew away everything on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re going to have a dogfight now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Wyverns led by the Alpha Male and Sungwoo’s Wyverns clashed in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They got entangled just tens of meters in the air in a fierce dogfight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Kugugugugugugugu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>The fight shook the whole area. They knocked the other Wyverns down to the ground, and some of them bounced back, thrown into a building. Then, they kept soaring and falling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, the zombie birds flew between the giant Wyverns at high speed, sticking to their heads and pecking their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players were dumbfounded by the Wyverns’ fierce fighting, but they saw something like humans riding on Wyverns’ back. They were Minsok and Orun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The iron maces’ attacks from the battlements on Mt. Paldal were still fatal to the Wyverns. Although the enemy Wyverns and friendly Bone Wyverns were hit by the iron maces, Bone Wyverns kept reviving.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 750,004 gold by hunting Wyvern.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 744,454 gold by hunting Wyvern.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo now began to feel that he could win the fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Wyvern Alpha Male, faced with the crisis, was ready to soar into the sky again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just like he did at the fight at Kimpo International Airport, the monster boldly turned and flew away when he was met with an insurmountable situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But this time Sungwoo had no intention of letting him fly away again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Follow him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo jumped on the back of Bone Wyvern and chased the monster closely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wyvern Alpha Male finally turned completely, and the other Wyverns also began to prepare for the escape.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Twilight Raid!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Twilight Raid’ begins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo collected all the souls for this attack. Soon, 20 souls came out of Sungwoo’s body and colored his body like paint.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sunngwoo became a black ghost. He felt his body was lighter than air and floating. However, there was a strong power in it. He felt confident that he could squeeze anything.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I can crush Wyvern Alpha Male.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo then flew towards the boss monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Guwoooooooo!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A black tornado hit his back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The boss monster resisted but could not withstand Sungwoo’s massive attack. Sungwoo’s magical power smashed his body. No matter how strongly the boss monster fluttered his wings, he could not help but nose-dive back to the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The boss monster was swallowed by the black tornado. With his wings bent in a V-shape, he fell hundreds of meters down, straight toward the ground. He fell in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuug! Kugugugugugugugu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>His heavy body fell on the asphalt road with a huge impact.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since he was the boss monster, however, he was different from ordinary Wyverns. He wasn’t weak enough to suffer fatal injuries just by falling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo’s ‘Twilight Raid’ was not a simple skill aimed at shooting down the opponent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Twenty “dead hands” emerged from the ground and held Wyvern Alpha Male’s body tightly. They grabbed not only his wings but also his chin, neck, and legs tightly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaak! Kaaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Because of this unexpected attack, the boss monster could not move for 10 seconds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At last, Sungwoo appeared in front of him, holding a giant scythe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Behind him appeared Jisu and Minsok followed by Orun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s your first time looking up at somebody, right?” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He struck its head with the Grim Reaper.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ten seconds was longer than expected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the moment when the Korean server and the ruler of the sky changed hands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The world tree (growth stage 1) is growing. (99%) </div><h2 id="chapter179">Chapter 179</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>10 seconds was a long time. In particular, it was enough time for Sungwoo to subdue an opponent who could not move at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaak! Kaaaaakaa-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wyvern Alpha Male was a huge creature, so Sungwoo couldn’t end his life within ten seconds. In that respect, Jisu played a big role.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She knew how to collapse the huge body. In other words, she knew exactly how to kill this monster, especially which muscles and tendons she had to cut to destroy him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was her insight. As a physical education major, she has cut countless monsters until now in the battles. Using her rich fighting experiences and insight, she could make an unusual judgment in killing the boss monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The blade of her sword pierced his thick scales and got stuck into his tough flesh to cut his tendons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Done! Now, he can’t fly or walk,” Jisu said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, he was still breathing after 10 seconds passed, but he couldn’t fly anymore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>10 seconds gave Sungwoo’s party another golden chance for attack. Minsok ended his windpipe by swinging the ‘Ownerless Sword’ in his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 4,324,500 gold by hunting the boss monster ‘Wyvern Alpha Male’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Special rewards will be given by hunting the boss monster. (Secret store coupon)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have acquired the title ‘Conqueror of Sky’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Increased agility level (+2)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Increased stamina (+2)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Increased physical defense (+10%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Increased wind resistance (+20%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players obtained a considerable amount of gold even though it was Sungwoo and Jisu who hunted Wyvern Alpha Male. Given the amount of gold, this fight was more difficult than the Hell Moving Armor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo obtained a ‘secret store coupon’, so he thought he had to set a date for shopping for items in the future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Time remaining until you are qualified: 2,733 days<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo reduced the time by 700 days by hunting Wyvern Alpha Male, which meant if he could hunt four more monsters like it, he could finally fulfill the requirements for the qualifications.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That’s not the only reward Sungwoo received.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Something inside me is getting hot again.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He felt that ‘hot’ feeling was rather familiar. So, he pulled something out of pocket. It was a card.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woooooooong-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The “B-Class EXP Card” he obtained after hunting the Hell-Moving Armor was glowing green.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It’s a level-up card.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>As he used it once before, the card reminded Sungwoo when he could level up by using it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have reached the level of EXP with which you can level up. Would you like to use a coupon?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, Sungwoo used the coupon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 21)<br/><br/><br/><br/>He chose the ‘Skill’ item on the level-up card, and the maximum number of his subordinate spirits also increased by 3.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, he didn’t feel like it was a huge gain like before. Since he could regenerate the undead after obtaining the Grim Reaper, he didn’t feel any regret about the small increase in number this time. Of course, if he could deal with more undead, he would gain more power, so he was satisfied with the small increase in his subordinate spirits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It looks like the dogfighting in the sky is almost at an end,” said Jisu, wiping her sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since they killed Wyvern Alpha Male, it was a matter of time before they got rid of the other Wyverns under him. Even if they were numerically superior to Bone Wyverns, they could not beat the undead because they kept reviving even after being killed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thus, the sky of the Korean server was completely conquered by Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t just Sungwoo that was growing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since Sungwoo hunted a lot of mighty monsters, the world tree was supplied with excellent quality nutrients.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wooooooooong! Wooooooooooong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The world tree shined, then started to grow in an instant. It grew as high as a three-story building at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The world tree has reached the “2nd stage of growth”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your stats have increased as you are “linked” to the world tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Increased muscle strength (+1)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The village players also couldn’t shut their mouths, watching the dramatic scene. Since the world tree was growing so fast, their eyes could hardly catch up with its growth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Growing as high as that at once?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who knows if it can reach the clouds soon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t just the size of the tree that changed. The rays of light spreading from the roots to the leaves turned a little cloudy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was hard to notice it without a closer look, but it seemed to suggest some kind of change.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The world tree is forming some ‘propensity’ thanks to your influence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Propensity?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was not sure whether it would be positive for the world tree to be affected by the Necromancer, but he could not stop it anyway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The world tree gains a new power. <br/><br/><br/><br/>* The miracle of the god tree forms a powerful ‘invisible world’ in the whole area. This can act as a strong shield and deter unwanted people from entering.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The world tree gains a new power. <br/><br/><br/><br/>* Whenever “the one who is blessed by the world tree” takes another life, their souls are bound by the world tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the world tree entered the “second stage of growth,” it began to have special powers like this. First of all, it had a defensive ability called , which was fortunate for Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the world tree was always defended by Sungwoo and others, it was open to an unexpected outside attack anytime.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought, ‘If Terror Kim had thrown a bomb in a surprise attack, the world tree might have been blown away.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>What would happen if he fired a flying weapon such as the ‘Iron Mace of Lightning’ from a distance? Sungwoo had been nervous because there was no way he could prevent an outsider’s attack that would devastate the whole area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, with the  in hand, he could prevent not only powerful attacks from a distance but also the enemy’s secret infiltration. Only now could he feel relaxed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘By the way, who the hell is ?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could not figure out the use for .<br/><br/><br/><br/>To make the best-educated guess he could, he felt that he might save the “soul” consumed in using his skills when he obtained the power of “Anubis.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Then, I can use Anubis with maximum efficiency.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Generally speaking, when he deactivates the condition of Anubis, the remaining souls are not saved anywhere. That’s why he had to save souls in advance before hunting the Wyverns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Otherwise, he could not avoid the lack of firepower at the beginning of the battle, so he had to waste considerable time to accumulate as many souls as he needed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, if he could be supplied with the necessary souls without going through that process, it would be the best option for him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Well, the world tree can consume even souls? Man, I’m getting a bit nervous.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that the world tree was getting more and more estranged from its classic image as something called the tree of life.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Anyway, the world tree is growing very strong.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But there wasn’t only good news for Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The Angel camp has increased the bounty on your head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Angel camp’s bounty: 70,000,000 gold<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Demon camp has increased the bounty on your head upwards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Demon camp’s bounty: 25,000,000 gold<br/><br/><br/><br/>-As your influence grows, the bounty quest is upgraded from ‘server quest’ to ‘world quest’. From now on, players around the world will be targeting your life.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this?” Sungwoo asked, embarrassed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, you are now known around the world!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the moment when the name of the Korean server, Necromancer, and the existence of the third camp became known on the world stage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since there were no signs of a solution in the Korean server, it seemed that the Absolute Race came up with a bigger alternative. In other words, they decided to throw the Necromancer on the world stage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But if you are the target of world players, I guess the Chinese server will be crazy about killing you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Hanho said, the “China-2 Server” players, who had been defeated by the Necromancer, would welcome this quest with open hands because they knew they would gain an enormous reward by killing the Necromancer, their cherished enemy. </div><h2 id="chapter180">Chapter 180</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>“Uh… This is a secret message sent by Heyon. According to her, the Chinese community keeps talking about you. It looks like you are very popular in mainland China.”<br/><br/>The players on Kanghwa Island were spying on the Chinese server community through the Chinese players they held captive.<br/><br/>Heyon shared the details through her secret message, all of which were ridiculous.<br/><br/>According to her, the pirates, aka the Red Revolutionary Army, were advertising that they would kill the Necromancer and that they already prepared a good strategy to kill him.<br/><br/>“They are arguing that they have had the angel statues for a long time, so they already have 3,000 players ready to work for the Angel camp. Of course, nobody knows for sure. Anyway, they are bragging that they are going to get a lot of buffs and wipe out the Necromancer and his 3rd faction.”<br/><br/>Furthermore, they even detailed the long-term goal of occupying the Korean peninsula on the Chinese community.<br/><br/>Hanho got furious after reading the message.<br/><br/>“Damn it! Why are these pirates running wild again? It looks like they have not yet come to their senses. Should I kill them again?”<br/><br/>“Kill them?”<br/><br/>“Anyway, all the Chinese people on the mainland are asking the pirates to kill you by all means! Maybe, at this moment, the person who receives the most hatred in the world is you, Sungwoo.”<br/><br/>After the scenes of their players being slaughtered by the Necromancer were broadcasted to the Chinese community, their hatred toward him knew no limits.<br/><br/>Thanks to that, the Red Revolutionary Army was enjoying great popularity among the Chinese people on the mainland.<br/><br/>“Oh, my god! I just imagined something ominous for a moment. Will I fight those countless Chinese people someday?” Hanho asked.<br/><br/>“I think so,” Sungwoo answered.<br/><br/>“Then, should I pay homage to my ancestors first?” Hanho said gloomily.<br/><br/>That night, Heyon kept delivering news about the movement of the Chinese server community. Since the Necromancer’s bounty was issued as a World Quest, the Chinese server was also overflowing with all kinds of issues about the Necromancer all day long, so new information was constantly coming in.<br/><br/>On the Chinese server, they were making a strong case for occupying the Korean peninsula. Moreover, the Red Revolutionary Army offered to hold a huge rally to commemorate the conquest of Taiwan and the future task of conquering Korea. They were now actively advertising the projected rally widely.<br/><br/>“They’re going completely insane! It seems they still have a large force even after we devastated them. They are going to hold even a parade. Just crazy bastards!”<br/><br/>They even announced to advertise their power, they would broadcast the parade with about 100,000 attending live. How could they conceive such a parade in this era?<br/><br/>“By the way, why are there so many forces around us who are trying to attack us? Even the Japanese server guys are looking for a chance to attack Korea, aren’t they?”<br/><br/>Since the Absolute Race set a huge price on the Necromancer’s head, plus 70 million gold as a reward, it was clear that people attempting to take the life of the Necromancer of the Korean server would appear everywhere.<br/><br/>“Well, I don’t think they are all.”<br/><br/>“Really? Does it mean those guys in America and Europe are also targeting you? Man, do we have to confront those guys after we defeat the Chinese guys?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo wasn’t sure about that, but those in regions other than China were most likely hostile to him.<br/><br/>“I can’t confirm it now, but I think they have already become our potential adversary.”<br/><br/>Given the huge bounty on the Necromancer’s head, those in the top rankings on other servers could not help but pay great attention to the unexpected bounty quest.<br/><br/>It was natural that they showed such a fervent reaction because the player from an alien server who may be their enemy in the future, the Necromancer, appeared. They were greedy for the bounty, but they remained alert.<br/><br/>‘Well, if I was in their shoes, even I may be curious about this guy who is confronting the Absolute Race…’ Sungwoo thought to himself.<br/><br/>Targeting the Necromancer meant that they were targeting the Korean server itself.<br/><br/>As a result of so many people focusing on him, a quest was also issued to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>[Faction Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: Operation Counterattack<br/><br/>-Type: Raid and Propaganda<br/><br/>-Goal: Broadcast scenes of great damage being done to the other camp<br/><br/>-Reward: faction skill, faction item<br/><br/>*The established forces (Absolute Race) are wary of the emergence of new forces. They are turning to all kinds of ways to keep you in check by mocking you in a variety of ways and declaring a war even before the faction is founded. This will have a negative impact on you and your faction’s reputation. That is why you need to counterattack. Prove your enemies are wrong. Broadcast it, so that more people witness it through the air.<br/><br/>* Condition: You must launch the first strike.<br/><br/>* If the scene of your being defeated is exposed, you will be given a penalty.<br/><br/>“Broadcast…”<br/><br/>In short, according to the condition, Sungwoo should make sure the scenes of the third camp destroying the Absolute Race camp should be broadcast to everyone. It was a bizarre condition.<br/><br/>‘As expected, the system makes this game more fierce.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled out an item from his pocket.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Angel’s Wing Fragment<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: consumption<br/><br/>Item-Effect: When you use it, you can move to the ‘Angel Statue’ within a certain range. (1 time) * The Demon camp cannot use it.<br/><br/>-Description: When the statue is destroyed, it is used for the final emergency escape.<br/><br/>This was an item Sungwoo obtained after destroying a statue. The members of the Demon camp were restricted to stop the enemy camps from using it, but Sungwoo had not yet created a new camp. In other words, he could use the loophole of the system.<br/><br/>“I think I have to stop by Taiwan anyway.”<br/><br/>He was thinking of attending the Red Revolutionary Army’s huge rally as a surprise guest, where 100,000 people were supposed to gather.<br/><br/>Destroying Sungwoo and the third camp had been upgraded to a “World Quest.” As a result, more people would be hostile to Sungwoo, but for now, there was nothing for Sungwoo to prepare against their possible attack. Of course, the best option would be for him to prepare for it slowly and thoroughly.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I’ve confirmed that an invisible barrier zone around 2 kilometers has been set up,” Inho said.<br/><br/>“Is it possible to get out and come back through the invisible barrier?”<br/><br/>Inho nodded at Sungwoo’s question, and replied, “Yes. We can go back and forth freely, but considering the message ‘Allowed Player’ only, it seems that outsiders are not allowed to enter.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo asked Inho to check the range of influence of the “Shadow of God Tree,” the skill of the world tree.<br/><br/>When Inho checked out the area by mobilizing a dozen search teams, he confirmed that the invisible barrier zone had been established.<br/><br/>[Shadow of God Tree]<br/><br/>-Shield (150,000/150,000)<br/><br/>-Access allowed: 226 people (see list)<br/><br/>* Blocking outsiders’ access<br/><br/>Sungwoo could also check the information about it, but he needed to double-check it.<br/><br/>“You should not let down your guard even if there is an invisible barrier zone because there may be items that can neutralize it.”<br/><br/>“Got it. Let me organize a surveillance team so that they can patrol around the barrier zone.”<br/><br/>Now, the Suwon village was not just a refuge for survivors. It was a place where the world tree was growing, and it would develop into the main stronghold of the third camp led by Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Therefore, Sungwoo had to make sure the village had to be carefully managed in every way so that the village players could respond perfectly to external threats.<br/><br/>That afternoon, Sungwoo summoned the village’s key personnel, including Kyoungsu and Inho.<br/><br/>“I think I have to go outside the village again. I don’t know how long it will take, but I’m going to ask you a favor once again.”<br/><br/>“Sure, please.”<br/><br/>Kyongsu and Inho had successfully defended the village and strengthened the village players, so he could trust them.<br/><br/>But the situation changed two days ago when the value of the village increased markedly with the birth of the world tree as well as it becoming the target of an unspecified number of people.<br/><br/>“If you encounter a dangerous situation, please contact the community. I can come here right away using the skill of the world tree.”<br/><br/>Fortunately, Sungwoo got the skill of ‘Return’ after eating the first fruit of the world tree and ‘linking’ with it. So, he could move to the world tree immediately once every 24 hours.<br/><br/>“Please take this.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo gave an item to Inho. </div><h2 id="chapter181">Chapter 181</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Vault of Oath<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: Finance<br/><br/>-Effect: Some of the gold earned by the ‘contracted player’ is automatically deposited.<br/><br/>-Description: You can ‘sign a contract’ by placing your palm on the safe. The vault owner can set a ‘collection rate’, and the amount of gold earned by the contractor is automatically deposited into the vault.<br/><br/>* Collection rate: 10%<br/><br/>* Registered contractors: 226 people<br/><br/>* Current Gold: 5,155,048<br/><br/>“This is the safe that you contracted last time, right?” Inho asked.<br/><br/>“Yes, that’s right. Since you have signed the contract, 10% of the gold earned so far has been accumulated. You can use it to fund the village’s operation,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Since Sungwoo has been hunting the monsters aiming for the world tree, a huge amount of gold has been accumulated in the safe.<br/><br/>Sungwoo had the intention of using the gold he earned for personal purposes, namely something like a protection fee. However, it was right for him to invest it in the village right now.<br/><br/>“Okay. For now, we have enough items such as batteries and ‘drinking water purifiers are enough, so we should expect to have more magic drones in the future.”<br/><br/>No matter how much money Sungwoo had, the only way to get more items was to draw them randomly at the store.<br/><br/>“Oh, in the ‘Other Items’ category of the level-up cards, you can find parts that can make weapons such as flying weapons,” Inho said.<br/><br/>Kyongsu added, nodding at his words, “Right. Not long ago, a monster crackdown team leader chose an item called ‘Ballista Blueprint’. If we can get the materials we need to make, I think we can run something like an armory.”<br/><br/>The “Ballista” they obtained from the Red Orcs and the “Iron Mace of Lightning” they acquired from the Evolution Society were certainly dreadful weapons. If they could get more items like that, they would be a tremendous addition to their power when the war among factions broke out in the future.<br/><br/>If they regarded dozens of Bone Wyverns as an air force, they could call lots of flying weapons artillery. Needless to say, they would serve as mighty firepower for Sungwoo and his allies in future conflicts.<br/><br/>“Very good. Don’t spare money to get more materials for the weapons.”<br/><br/>At that time, Hanho, who was watching the community bulletin, suddenly stood and shouted, “Sungwoo! We’ve got another message from Kanghwa Island.”<br/><br/>The players of Kanghwa Island, including Muyon and Heyon, expressed their support for Sungwoo and his third camp from the beginning, for they didn’t feel a sense of belonging to Junghoon’s new alliance. They were following the Necromancer who saved them.<br/><br/>“According to the message, the pirate bastards are holding the parade at the square of Taipei Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall at 3 pm tomorrow.”<br/><br/>The players on Kanghwa Island reported directly to Sungwoo, not Junghoon in Youngdungpo, whenever they had the latest news from the Chinese side.<br/><br/>“A lot of the prisoners who were expelled from China and those who were treated poorly in Taiwan will allegedly participate in the parade and strengthen their unity.”<br/><br/>After they had been expelled from the China-2 server, the Red Revolutionary Army was tossed out into the cold. However, after they succeeded in conquering Taiwan and advocated hunting the Necromancer, they recovered their former images surprisingly quickly. Their leader, Gen. Chongong, was not content with conquering Taiwan and was looking toward the Korean peninsula.<br/><br/>“In the end, he’s trying to show off to mainland China.”<br/><br/>To return to the mainland Chinese someday, the Red Revolution Army was trying to win the favor of Chinese players. That’s why they showed off their power by all means.<br/><br/>“By the way, it seems like they don’t get along well with the prisoners here. If that’s the case, don’t you think the size of the parade will be much larger than now?” In particular, not only the pirates but also the pro-Chinese forces and the prisoners will be all gathered, it’s going to be a super huge parade.”<br/><br/>“Really? Didn’t they invite us?”<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo was thinking of decorating the stage they ambitiously prepared a little more gorgeously.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a big change was taking place in Youngdungpo because of the new angel statue unearthed in Kimpo. When they touched the statue, they were given a new quest.<br/><br/>[Faction Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: Killing “Demon ” camp in the metropolitan area<br/><br/>-Type: Target destruction<br/><br/>-Goal: Destroy the demon statue in the north (Uijeongbu area)<br/><br/>-Reward: faction skill, rank score<br/><br/>There was a demon camp in the nearby area. The Angel executors were looking forward to removing the stumbling blocks early on for the safety and endless development of their allies.<br/><br/>* When the battle begins, you will receive ‘blessings’ from the Angel camp. (Defense increase 20%)<br/><br/>* When the battle begins, the ‘same quest’ is given to the opposing faction.<br/><br/>* You will fail the quest when the statue of the friendly team is destroyed.<br/><br/>“After all, this means we have to fight them. Commander, I don’t think we can avoid war this time.”<br/><br/>“By the way, what the heck is this statue in the north?”<br/><br/>“I think they are the Reconstruction Alliance in the north.”<br/><br/>“That’s what I expected…”<br/><br/>As a giant force that could be compared to the Liberation Guild, the Reconstruction Alliance gathered in the Uijeongbu area approached Youngdungpo, showing a willingness to join the new alliance that Junghoon was creating.<br/><br/>However, they seemed to monitor the strength of the nascent Alliance, while constantly disturbing its development. So, Sungwoo was planning to get rid of them someday, but unfortunately, they tried to get rid of the Necromancer to receive the huge bounty and were annihilated by him.<br/><br/>“If the Reconstruction Alliance is on the side of the Demon camp, it is very likely that they will try to fight us. I have not sized them up yet, but they also have over a thousand combat troops.”<br/><br/>After the players in the Reconstruction Alliance were annihilated by the Necromancer, they seemed to blame the Liberation Guild for it. Their attitude showed that there was a greater possibility of them trying to keep the Youngdungpo group in check rather than cooperating with them in the future. Moreover, if they were in the Demon camp, it was highly likely that the Youngdungpo players would not be able to avoid fighting them.<br/><br/>“In that case, we have to prepare to advance to Uijeongbu.”<br/><br/>If the opponent wasn’t the Necromancer, the Liberation Guild players were confident of beating anybody because the strongest force of the Korean server was still the Liberation Guild.<br/><br/>However, the situation began to turn around very quickly and urgently.<br/><br/>“Commander!”<br/><br/>A member of the Crusader Team burst open the door of the conference room and shouted.<br/><br/>“A guard post in the Dasan area was attacked!”<br/><br/>The Liberation Guild set up observation posts all over the metropolitan area to check the trends of the monsters. According to the member, the guard post in the Dasan New Town area was attacked.<br/><br/>“A surveillance team member witnessed it while patrolling near the area. He said it was not destroyed by monsters, but by a player.”<br/><br/>A player? Who dared to target the Liberation Guild?<br/><br/>“Oh, no way!”<br/><br/>At that moment, a common message for the Angelic camp and the Demon camp on the Korean server appeared.<br/><br/>[War Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: Battle for the Metropolitan Area (1)<br/><br/>-Main forces: Angel’s camp (Youngdungpo district, Seoul), Demon’s camp (Uijeongbu-dong, Uijeongbu City)<br/><br/>-Reward: Attack and defense increase 30% ( 7 days)<br/><br/>-Conditions: Occupy the following areas.<br/><br/>* In addition to the main forces, the players who belong to the Absolute Race faction can ‘join voluntarily’.<br/><br/>The message encouraged them to wage a war. They could not avoid it anymore.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“Damn it…”<br/><br/>The fact that the main forces of the Demon’s camp were in Uijeongbu-dong meant the statue was located there. In other words, the Reconstruction Alliance was responsible for the destruction of the guard post in Dasan.<br/><br/>“Deputy Commander, call the leaders of each group right now! Have the Crusaders on standby, and dispatch the surveillance team to that area,” Junghoon said.<br/><br/>“Okay!”<br/><br/>The first war event of the Korean server has begun.<br/><br/>As long as Junghoon and his forces belonged to the Absolute Race faction, they had to wage the war out of obligation, regardless of their will to fight.<br/><br/>War was both scary and interesting. Everyone doesn’t want a war, but everyone is interested in it. Who is fighting for what? How to fight? How terrible will it be? Which hero will emerge at the end of the war? And who will win?<br/><br/>The war was a comprehensive set of emotions and sorrows containing all kinds of stories that stimulate humans’ primitive senses.<br/><br/>Therefore, the ‘battle for the possession of the metropolitan area’ quickly became the top concern of the Korean server, overshadowing the situation of the Necromancer’s third camp. </div><h2 id="chapter182">Chapter 182</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “Are you ready for shooting the scene on the camera? This is going to be a scene that will go down in history, so try to focus on my face.”<br/><br/>Kangyoon Lee, a fire-type wizard with the Liberation Guild, was stationed near Cheongnyangni Station with his subordinates as the vanguard of the Angel camp.<br/><br/>He has long been famous because of his nickname “Kang Yoon” in the Korean community. He was widely known to have posted more comments than anyone else.<br/><br/>“Hmm, how many viewers are coming in to see this scene today? Around 50,000? Of course, they should.”<br/><br/>To put it simply, Kangyoon was a terrible attention seeker.<br/><br/>“It is one minute before the start of the broadcast.”<br/><br/>“Okay! Come on, let’s go!”<br/><br/>It was dangerous to broadcast the fighting scenes live in a war. Rather, it was crazy. It could expose the operation of the friendly forces and their military strength to the enemies.<br/><br/>However, there were dozens of broadcasts being aired from both camps. Most of the broadcasts were done by volunteers from other regions for fun, but there were also broadcasts operated by the main camp because they wanted to appeal to the viewers for participation in their camps.<br/><br/>“Captain, Commander has asked us to indirectly emphasize the benefits of the Angel camp. Don’t forget!”<br/><br/>“Okay!”<br/><br/>Since the battle had not yet begun seriously, they needed to secure as many troops as possible through a publicity campaign, so Kangyoon was selected as the chief charged with that mission. “Now, at this moment, I am more important than the Necromancer, so you should film my face with a sense of responsibility. Got it?”<br/><br/>“Okay!”<br/><br/>“You can just keep going like that. We’re going to focus on you. So, don’t worry!”<br/><br/>No matter how spectacular the Necromancer’s activities were, it was not as shocking as the fact that there broke out a war between the Absolute Races.<br/><br/>It was natural that the Korean server players would immediately focus their attention on northern Seoul. Kangyoon’s broadcast stood out among them.<br/><br/>“Broadcasting starts in five, four, three…”<br/><br/>A few hours ago, he posted the pictures of the Demon camp’s search team members being burned on the community bulletin, causing a shocking sensation.<br/><br/>At the same time, he jarred the nerves of the Demon camp with provocative comments.<br/><br/>“Even the noise marketing was perfect.”<br/><br/>So, he laid the foundation for instigating the viewers to join the Angel camp.<br/><br/>Kangyoon and his subordinates expected that when the broadcast began, tens of thousands of people would come in to see the scenes.<br/><br/>‘If the fight between the Angel and the Demon camps is framed like this, the Necromancer will be gone without any traces. A third camp led by the Necromancer? Bullshit! Let me see how long he can keep it.”<br/><br/>Thinking so, Kangyoon frowned. He felt jealous towards the Necromancer, but rationally, it was impossible for the Necromancer to run on the path of success by making the Absolute Race his enemy, no matter how strong he was.<br/><br/>“Now, the broadcast starts…”<br/><br/>Kangyoon smiled again in a leisurely manner.<br/><br/>“Well, hello! This is K.Y., Kangyoon who is your hero!”<br/><br/>He opened the window, gesturing naturally. Cheongnyangni Station was seen from the window.<br/><br/>“Have you seen the scenes of me pouring hellfire over the followers of the Demon camp?”<br/><br/>Then, he raised his right hand and lit a small flame.<br/><br/>“Huhhhhh! I smelled the burning of dried filefish fillets when I burned them. From now on, we’re going to broadcast from Cheongnyangni…”<br/><br/>However, the expressions of his subordinates monitoring the broadcast were not good.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Kangyoon, feeling something strange, stopped speaking and tilted his head.<br/><br/>Then, one of his subordinates began to check his looks.<br/><br/>“Captain?”<br/><br/>“Uh? What’s up?”<br/><br/>“There are only 19 viewers?”<br/><br/>“What the heck are you talking about?”<br/><br/>That was ridiculous. How could it be only 19? Soon, his men found out the reason.<br/><br/>“Yes, the Necromancer has also started broadcasting. Looks like all the viewers have switched to that channel.”<br/><br/>When that annoying name appeared. Kangyoon immediately frowned.<br/><br/>“What the heck? This is a war situation. Why is he trying to broadcast in the middle of the battlefield when there is nothing important happening? Does it make any sense?”<br/><br/>“Well…”<br/><br/>After all, one of his subordinates accessed the Necromancer’s broadcast and checked what’s going on.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this? Uh? What is it?”<br/><br/>“The Necromancer has stormed us!”<br/><br/>He just kept repeating something that Kangyoon couldn’t understand at all.<br/><br/>“Uh, where did he attack?”<br/><br/>“I have no idea. I don’t think he has attacked our country. I see some Chinese characters. No way!”<br/><br/>“China?”<br/><br/>Once again, all their eyes turned to the Necromancer on the screen.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Zhongzheng District, Taipei, Taiwan, at 3 pm.<br/><br/>The Red Revolutionary Army’s rally was being held at this place created to commemorate Taiwan’s first president, Chiang Kai-shek. They held it in front of the spiritual symbol of Taiwan to commemorate their occupation of Taiwan.<br/><br/>“With the conviction that we will unite as one force, faced with the current disaster, and create a new world…”<br/><br/>While the moderator proceeded with the formal opening, the main figures of the Red Revolutionary Army were seated at the head table on the gorgeous podium.<br/><br/>At the center was Gen. Chongong, the Red Revolutionary Army’s top generals on his right, and some of the converted Taiwanese players and prisoners.<br/><br/>“And our great cause was realized through the insight of the prophet and our king, Gen. Chongong, and under his will his two brothers, Gen. Jigon and Gen. Ingong, who didn’t hesitate to sacrifice themselves for Gen. Chongong…”<br/><br/>And there were a huge number of players crowded in the square they were facing: pirates, friendly Taiwanese players, mobilized elderly people, and prisoners.<br/><br/>This scene was being broadcast live to the China-2 server as well as the China-1 server and China-3 server.<br/><br/>After the Red Revolutionary Army publicized this event widely, several factions on each server sent people, so they could broadcast the scene on their servers.<br/><br/>In other words, all the people in China were watching this scene.<br/><br/>“Now Gen. Chongong, our eternal savior, will deliver a keynote speech. I hope you will greet our leader with big applause.”<br/><br/>When thunderous applause erupted, Gen. Chongong dressed in red silk stood up. He walked sternly to the podium and stood before the stand, reaching out and moving the microphone.<br/><br/>Then, he slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“I promise all the people who attended this event I will support you.”<br/><br/>Applause came out again this time.<br/><br/>Gen. Chongong raised his hand and continued, “I stood alone on the day when we were faced with the disaster. And I began to hire loyal servants one by one, and today, I reclaimed Taiwan which we had lost a long time ago. And let me declare proudly that tomorrow we will move into the Korean peninsula.”<br/><br/>Thud-<br/><br/>At that moment, there was a thunderous roar somewhere. He felt a little vibration under his feet. However, not many people noticed it.<br/><br/>“I will kill the Necromancer, the demon of the Korean peninsula, and rescue the survivors of the Korean peninsula from their miserable destiny…”<br/><br/>Ku-woooooooooo-<br/><br/>There was a huge vibration again. This time, it shook the whole square where they were holding the ceremony.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Gen. Chongong stopped his speech and wriggled his eyebrows. He felt ominous. There was silence in the square.<br/><br/>Then, those who gathered in the square also began to turn their heads one by one, following Gen. Chongong.<br/><br/>Whooooooooo-<br/><br/>A gust of wind that came from an unknown place swept over the square. Gen. Chongong’s red silk robe fluttered roughly. The next moment there was a thunderous explosion.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>The ceiling of the National Library building beyond the square collapsed, where something was soaring. The cameraman moved the camera lens and filmed it.<br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/>A monster made of huge bones spread its wings then flew into the sky of Taiwan.<br/><br/>“Is it Wyvern?”<br/><br/>It was Bone Wyvern Alpha Male.<br/><br/>Right after that, dozens of Bone Wyverns poured out like a swarm of bats.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>“What the hell are they?”<br/><br/>The sun in the western sky was blocked by the wings of the huge veil, and a huge shadow waved over the crowds gathered in the square.<br/><br/>Everyone in the square as well as those watching the broadcast witnessed Lich, the one on the largest Wyvern’s back, surrounded by green flames.<br/><br/>“No way! Is he the Necromancer?”<br/><br/>“Right? He must be that Necromancer, right?”<br/><br/>“Oh, that bastard of the Korean server?”<br/><br/>As they said, he was that famous Necromancer of the Korean server.<br/><br/>He unexpectedly appeared right here at this ceremony.<br/><br/>“How could he come here?”<br/><br/>He was holding a giant scythe in one hand and a white stone in the other, which was none other than the head of the Angel Statue.<br/><br/>The next moment, he smashed the statue to fragments and threw them away. </div><h2 id="chapter183">Chapter 183</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            -Third option: Destroy the statues of the Absolute Race (2/3)<br/><br/>“Necromancer!”<br/><br/>While watching, Gen. Chongong shouted, gnashing teeth.<br/><br/>He shouted at the top of his voice, forgetting his honor and dignity.<br/><br/>“Why did you come here? What the heck?”<br/><br/>And that’s why all the players had no choice but to tune into Necromancer’s broadcast.<br/><br/>The shadows the Necromancer brought covered the strange land.<br/><br/>The expression, a “dramatic moment,” was reserved for this moment.<br/><br/>“Necromancer!”<br/><br/>The Necromancer, the enemy of the China-2 server, appeared in Taiwan.<br/><br/>He appeared while Gen. Chongong was delivering the keynote speech in which he announced he would kill the Necromancer and occupy the Korean server.<br/><br/>“Man, what the hell are those monsters…?”<br/><br/>Gen. Chongong could not figure out the identity of the troops Sungwoo brought. There were monsters made of bones with huge wings everywhere. They weren’t one or two. Dozens of Wyverns filled the sky of Taiwan.<br/><br/>Wherever Gen. Chongong looked in the northern sky, their huge wings covered the sky, and their flapping wings caused a gust of wind.<br/><br/>Whoowoong―<br/><br/>So, Gen. Chongong got confused as if a typhoon landed in Taiwan with huge dark clouds.<br/><br/>“Are you sure that’s the Necromancer?”<br/><br/>“Yeah, that’s a devil. Devil!”<br/><br/>The players of the Red Revolutionary Army were taught about their persistent bad ties with the Korean server. They were brainwashed that they must destroy the Korean server someday as part of their efforts to regain the Chinese server.<br/><br/>However, they realized the Necromancer they encountered now was never the object of conquest. They felt like the Necromancer was something they had to avoid by all means.<br/><br/>“Everybody, get ready for the fight!”<br/><br/>“Everyone, prepare for his attack!”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Korean server, the Taiwanese server, and the Chinese server,<br/><br/>were watching the scene, as well as the broadcasting agencies and communities in the three regions began to make a big fuss over the fighting.<br/><br/>A situation nobody expected unfolded, and nobody could predict what would happen in the future.<br/><br/>Riding on the back of Bone Wyvern Alpha Male, Sungwoo looked down at the square.<br/><br/>Tens of thousands of players were crowded in front of the square. On the red podium at the very end, he could see the main figures including Gen.Chongong seated.<br/><br/>‘That guy must be Gen. Chongong.’<br/><br/>The man dressed in red, Gen. Chongong, caught his eye. He was looking up at Sungwoo with an embarrassed and angry expression.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, there are a lot of snipers on the roof of the building. I can feel a lot of troops moving around the square.”<br/><br/>Jisun, who was riding on a different Wyvern right behind Sungwoo, briefed him about the situation. As she said, there was tight security in and around the square.<br/><br/>Although Gen. Chongong and his subordinates didn’t expect Sungwoo would make a surprise attack by using the ‘Angel’s Wing Fragment’, they were thoroughly prepared for the contingent situation because they were holding a very important event.<br/><br/>Furthermore, almost all of the troops under Gen. Chongong were gathered in one place for the parade. They were so large in number that it was difficult to count them accurately.<br/><br/>As a result, it would never be an easy fight.<br/><br/>‘By the way, not everyone who participated in the parade is my enemy.’<br/><br/>This was Taiwan. So, many of them might have been forced to attend the parade after Taiwan had been conquered by the pirates.<br/><br/>However, there was no way for Sungwoo to distinguish them. Besides, if he paid attention to that, he would not be able to wage the battle efficiently.<br/><br/>‘I can’t hesitate to attack Gen. Chongong and his forces because of that.’<br/><br/>He needed to be more aggressive in his approach.<br/><br/>“Let us get rid of the snipers first,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/>There was snipers’ busy movement on the rooftop of the surrounding building.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo had to kill the snipers first. If they were allowed to move around freely, it was inevitable that Sungwoo and his party’s actions would be limited.<br/><br/>“Jisu, please proceed with the second operation.”<br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/>Nodding at him, she flew away in the opposite direction from Sungwoo.<br/><br/>She had work to do there.<br/><br/>“Wipe them out,” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/>He dispatched 33 Bone Wyverns and 9 zombie monster birds.<br/><br/>They folded their wings and started to descend ferociously. They moved as fast as a bullet.<br/><br/>“Uh? They are flying toward us!”<br/><br/>“Damn it! Everybody, run away!”<br/><br/>The snipers on the rooftop could not help but be embarrassed. They weren’t preparing for aircraft fire, but they were monitoring the security around the square.<br/><br/>Therefore, they were helplessly exposed to the Wyverns’ attack.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>A Bone Wyvern lifted his claws and made a dent on the rooftop. Although the Wyvern passed over it only once, there was a long cut on the rooftop, and all the snipers fell over the railings.<br/><br/>In the meantime, zombie monster birds flew here and there in groups, leaving deadly scars on the heads, faces, and necks of the snipers with their beaks and claws.<br/><br/>“Argh! Take them off me!”<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuuuuh…”<br/><br/>Only their tattered corpses were left behind in the place where the zombie monster birds passed and wiped them out like a swarm of locusts.<br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/>3) Aerial advantage (2nd stage)<br/><br/>-Category: Trait Synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: 40 or more flying traits<br/><br/>-Effect: Flying speed increases (30%), descending speed increases (20%), probability of WOE attack avoidance increases (20%)<br/><br/>Because of this synergy effect of “Aerial advantage (2nd stage),” they could even focus accurately on their targets.<br/><br/>“I can’t aim at them because they are flying so fast!”<br/><br/>Even if they managed to aim at the Wyverns and monster birds, they could not get them with just one attack. Even if they succeeded in destroying the Wyverns and monster birds, that was not the end because they would be revived.<br/><br/>“We have to get off of the rooftop right now!”<br/><br/>“Get out of here!”<br/><br/>In the end, they couldn’t stop the Wyverns’ relentless attack.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh! We’re too late! Lie down!”<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>The snipers resisted by counterattacking as best as they could, but they could not avoid the fate of being killed and absorbed by Sungwoo as souls.<br/><br/>-You have exploited a soul. (37 items)<br/><br/>Sungwoo used the Human Beast (Werewolf) ampoule early to gain the power of Anubis.<br/><br/>He spent the acquired souls and invested them in strengthening the undead.<br/><br/>-You have strengthened the undead using exploited souls. (3 stacks)<br/><br/>1) Attack power increases by 10%<br/><br/>2) Defense increases by 10%<br/><br/>3) Immunity to magic increases by 10%<br/><br/>The more the battle continued, the stronger Sungwoo’s subordinate spirits would be.<br/><br/>The given time was only one hour, but it was certain that quite a few of Gen. Chongong’s men would be killed in one hour.<br/><br/>In an instant, all the rooftops around the area were destroyed, and the snipers there were annihilated.<br/><br/>“Now, we are storming into the center,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was watching what’s going on from Bone Wyvern Alpha Male in the sky.<br/><br/>Those who gathered in the square were running away from the square in a disorganized manner. After the players who had nothing to do with the pirates left the place hurriedly, those who were left behind were the real target of Sungwoo’s attack.<br/><br/>“Okay, wipe them out!”<br/><br/>Bone Wyverns grabbed the debris of the rooftop. They grabbed a mass of concrete, rebar, and even the bodies of the pirates with both feet, then glided towards the parade to throw them over their heads.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>“Everybody, lie down!”<br/><br/>The square was vast, but there were too many people crowded there. Since the square was crammed full of people, there was no space for them to move around, so they could not avoid the stones raining down on their heads.<br/><br/>-You have earned 8,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/>-You have earned 11,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/>-You have earned 12,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/>With the concrete fragments pouring on their heads like hail, they were not armed with any weapons because they attended the parade, so they could not avoid the monsters’ attack.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>“Lift your shields! Protect your head!”<br/><br/>Moreover, the bodies strewn everywhere heralded the beginning of their secondary damages.<br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/>The security guards came running and lifted their shields to protect themselves from the falling stones, but they could not pay attention to the corpses of their colleagues scattered under their feet. While they were raising their heads, their corpses swelled.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>With the explosions everywhere, the bodies of the pirates were ripped and bounced off in all directions. Since they were gathered in one place, the explosions caused more damage to them.<br/><br/>“Damn it! Get ready for the counterattack according to our operation!”<br/><br/>“Respond to the aerial attack!” </div><h2 id="chapter184">Chapter 184</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Soon, the wizards gathered together and began to prepare a large-scale shield. As they promised, they knew the way to kill the Necromancer. They had prepared some countermeasures against the aerial attack. The first step was creating a shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo also expected they would use a large-scale shield, so he had prepared a secret weapon to destroy it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something approached the wizards who were preparing magic from behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, they stormed and killed the wizards in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Keeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were none other than Orun and a group of ghouls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t just concrete and corpses that Bone Wyverns threw. Numerous small undead were also thrown, mixed with them. It was a way only available for the undead that could keep reviving indefinitely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Protect the wizards!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re done without the shield!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, they couldn’t stop the ghouls from attacking them in the rampage, and eventually, they could not use any magic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, a monster’s huge wings began to descend over the square without any hindrance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the biggest monster, the Bone Wyvern Alpha Male, and his arrival meant that the Necromancer also landed on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in the area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Death Response’ begins in the area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! A ‘poisonous cloud’ is formed in the area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer began to transform the place into a battlefield for him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pusheeeeeee―<br/><br/><br/><br/>A cloud of black smoke spread and squeezed everyone’s breath. And a huge number of undead poured out in the smoke that couldn’t be seen before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Block them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, move back and make the space for a retreat!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it. There are too many people for me to get out of this place.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Sungwoo’s attack didn’t end there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tuk- Tuk- Tuk-Tuk-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Raindrops started to fall on their heads. At first, they couldn’t even notice it was raining.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have been exposed to poisonous clouds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh! This, what is this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But soon they developed fatal symptoms. After they were exposed to raindrops containing poison, they began to have seizures in groups.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since they were already pushed aside by the monsters, they immediately collapsed one by one as soon as they were exposed to the poisonous raindrops.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Body functions have been weakened due to unknown energy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-2)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Furthermore, when Sungwoo entered into the status of a demigod, he even lowered the stats of the players around him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time, large undead such as Bone Drake and Ogre Skeleton rushed to the huge crowds of weakened humans and trampled on them like a bulldozer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo also swung the Grim Reaper and moved forward, spamming the repeating crossbows. Finally, he stood in front of the stairs on the platform.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On top of the 89 stairs, on the platform, stood Gen. Chongong. He was looking down at Sungwoo without moving a step.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those who appeared to be his bodyguards lined up on both sides of him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Four cameras were still operating beyond a small shield formed by two wizards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Necromancer…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Why was Gen. Chongong still and turning on the broadcast in a situation where he and his men were devastated by the monsters controlled by the Necromancer? It seemed he decided to have the cameras film the scenes of him killing the Necromancer by all means.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Otherwise, there was nothing he could rely on now because everything he intended, the forces that he built up until now, and the public opinion that he manipulated in his favor were collapsing all at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The camera lens captured two men at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gen. Chongong glared at the Necromancer then raised his right hand toward the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a ray of light shot from his palm.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The beam of light burst like a firecracker then began to scatter in all directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Its final destination was the head of the pirates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fanatic’s Runaway’ begins in the affected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Along with the message, the pirates trembled as if they were electrified by something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhh! Let’s sacrifice ourselves!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“For the safety of our general!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everyone, defend the general!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They screamed weirdly as if they were insane then began to rush Sungwoo like crazy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Until a little while ago they moved back to fight in a safe zone, but as soon as Gen. Chongong acted, they immediately ran wildly to chase Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It’s part of his skill of brainwashing the players,’ Sungwoo thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that Gen. Chongong seemed to have a job specializing in brainwashing low-level players. And he formed an unshakable army blindly following him. His ability to control the pirates was based on this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sacrifice your lives to protect our general!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t be afraid of death!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their eyes already turned red and the heat was surging all over their bodies as if they were given strong buffs. Although they were weakened by poisonous clouds, they didn’t seem to suffer any pain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Charge at him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hundreds of pirates rushed to Sungwoo like crazy. All of them spammed their skill, pushing out the undead to some extent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The four cameras busily captured the scenes that seemed to be a turnaround on the part of the pirates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! Our Revolutionary Army has risen again! They are back on the offensive, pushing out the Necromancer! Maybe, maybe…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The camera operator commented excitedly with some vague hope, but unfortunately, Sungwoo was calm and composed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It looks like they don’t know which way the wind is blowing.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players would stop moving anyway when they died. Moreover, when they died, they were transformed into souls and corpses that would be helpful to Sungwoo. Nonetheless, they were recklessly sacrificing themselves. Even though they were devastated by the Necromancer several times in the past, they still didn’t know how to deal with him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have strengthened the undead with exploited souls. (12 stacks)<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Attack power increases by 30% (+3)<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Defense increases by 30% (+3)<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Immunity to magic increases by 30% (+3)<br/><br/><br/><br/>4) Moving speed increases by 30% (+3)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you get hit twice by me and still don’t know me, you have to die.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo strengthened the undead using accumulated souls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After that, the pirates’ offensive was markedly weakened, and soon, the undead began to push them aggressively.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t stop attacking them to the end! Kuuuueeeeh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ranking officers of the Red Revolutionary Army, who were watching the fight, were astonished.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only then did they realize that they had been serving the wrong leader.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“General, we can’t beat him.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching them, Sungwoo slowly climbed the stairs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“General! Come on! Issue an order!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We must retreat now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their voices were broadcast in real-time on three Chinese servers and the Taiwanese servers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>An Anubis-shaped Necromancer approaching them was displayed on the screen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Stop him! Even if we suffer big damages, we have to kill him here and start over! If we can kill him, our people will support us…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he said that, a Werehog standing on his right raised an iron hammer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he began to stride toward Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whooooooooooh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Werehog struck the hammer toward Sungwoo’s head. However, after avoiding it quickly, Sungwoo stretched out his left hand and grabbed his wrist.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kueeeeeeeeeeeh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo broke his thick wrist with his tremendous grip. Since Sungwoo had mighty power similar to a stage four Werebull, he could easily deal with this kind of monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo threw him down the stairs then lifted the Grim Reaper.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Evil Spirit Bomb’ dwells in your weapon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He’s using his skill! Protect the general!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though they felt they were defeated, the brainwashed officers tried to protect Gen. Chongong. They surrounded the general.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But at that moment, Sungwoo swung the Grim Reaper.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Goo-gung Goo-goo-gung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the black wave overwhelmed them, the only person who was standing was Gen. Chongong. The officers had already been torn apart to the extent they could not be recognized.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed he could survive alone because his bracelet formed a shield around him. However, as if it was a disposable item, the bracelet broke and fell on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Huh huh huh, how could you break into my area and destroy my men? I thought you were a negligible being…” said Gen. Chongong with a hollow smile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stood tall in front of him and said, “Why do you think you are stronger than us?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What did you say?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you think if the territory of your country is large, you are good in every way? You still seem to be mistaken, but you have never been stronger than me for a single moment.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The only thing the pirates surpassed Sungwoo and his party in was their numerical superiority. They used brainwashing to control a huge number of mediocre troops, and they achieved victories by resorting to extreme strategies such as mini-games.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, after they had been severely defeated twice, they realized they could not confront the Necromancer with a human-wave strategy alone. Nevertheless, it seemed that they could not still admit it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The reason you have been defeated every time is because you haven’t given up that terrible delusion.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The scene of the Necromancer lifting the Grim Reaper was broadcast live on the servers in Korea, China, and Taiwan at the same time. </div><h2 id="chapter185">Chapter 185</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Riding on the back of Bone Wyvern hundreds of meters in the air, Hanho was looking down at Sungwoo fighting on the ground. Two men were riding together behind him. They were camera operators he brought with him for broadcasting.<br/><br/>And the broadcast they were broadcasting live broke the record by drawing the highest number of viewers ever on the Korean server.<br/><br/>[LIVE] Necromancer cracking down on the pirates’ lair in Taiwan (183,224 people watching)<br/><br/>“Wow! He’s crazy!”<br/><br/>Hanho, who was left behind to protect the cameramen, was now serving as a commentator about Sungwoo’s fighting.<br/><br/>“Can you see him wiping out the pirates as if he was sweeping away pests?”<br/><br/>When he looked down at Sungwoo’s fighting, Hanho could not find a better expression than “wipe them out” because of the overwhelming massacre.<br/><br/>Kuguuuuuuuung―<br/><br/>After Sungwoo’s Bone Wyvern Alpha Male landed in the middle of the square, black smoke spread and engulfed the whole area.<br/><br/>“Black smoke is always bad news for the enemies!”<br/><br/>As soon as Hanho said that, dozens of skeletons poured out of it, pushing the pirates fiercely. The scenes of the pirates collapsing like grass on a summer day were vividly captured by the camera lens from hundreds of meters in the air.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>The explosions of corpses among them, the pouring of concrete debris over their heads, and the large skeletons hitting them like rhinoceros showed it was not necessary to show the viewers that the Necromancer dominated the battlefield.<br/><br/>Hanho kept commentating in excitement, “The poisonous raindrops are falling over the heads of thousands of players! Ah, pirates! As if they didn’t expect it at all, they are helplessly exposed to it! They can’t endure long like that!”<br/><br/>As the last poisonous clouds were formed to pour out raindrops, the pirate camp began to collapse rapidly. Sungwoo’s AOE curse was enough to completely break their will to fight.<br/><br/>“Can you believe that only one man, the Necromancer, is defeating them now?”<br/><br/>Hanho’s propaganda broadcast was successful. The Necromancer, who was alienated by the war event between the Absolute Races, succeeded in pulling out the Angel and Demon camps’ broadcasts and drawing the attention of all the viewers at the moment.<br/><br/>[Real time chat]<br/><br/>─ Tank Assistant Manager Kim: Yes! This is war! Now, if you watch the fight between the Angel and Demon camps, you will feel like it’s like a child’s play.<br/><br/>─ Joonwo Park 33: Wonderful! This is the power of Korea!<br/><br/>─ Glasses Warrior: Good! Kill all the Chinese pirates!<br/><br/>─ kor-11334: He is Korean. He is fucking strong!<br/><br/>─ Healing sister: Good riddance! The pirates have been destroyed! I was really sad to see people killed by the pirates, and I’m so happy now.<br/><br/>Moreover, the quest would not end with Sungwoo’s conquest of Taiwan. Battles were happening simultaneously in other places.<br/><br/>Hanho raised his head and looked around downtown Taipei.<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuung- Kugugugugung-<br/><br/>Explosions and smoke occurred even in the place that was out of the Necromancer’s striking range. So, Hanho raised his finger to tell the cameramen to turn the camera lens there.<br/><br/>He couldn’t confirm who was fighting, but he could see clearly that the battle was taking place there too.<br/><br/>“Now, finally the Taiwanese players, who were dominated by the pirates, begin to fight back!”<br/><br/>The uprising of the Taiwanese players was also based on a prepared scenario.<br/><br/>“While the Necromancer was striking the center of the enemy camp, the Taiwanese players are waging a guerrilla war against the pirates!”<br/><br/>[Real time chat]<br/><br/>─ Kang SS: Wow, we can’t predict the Necromancer’s strategy at all!<br/><br/>─ Joonwoo Park 33: Yeah, this is Korea’s smart power!<br/><br/>─ Korean Dog: Wow! Was the Necromancer helping free Taiwan?<br/><br/>─ Kim Seung-yong: The Necromancer and his party are appearing anywhere where they are needed!<br/><br/>“Uh? Yeah, you guys are right! We contacted the Taiwanese players in advance to help them fight back! Isn’t it great?”<br/><br/>Of course, it was a lie. Shortly after arriving in the basement of the National Library where the angel statue was located, Sungwoo and his party accidentally encountered the Taiwanese players who had been detained in prison.<br/><br/>They said they were a resistance force against the Red Revolutionary Army, but they were caught preparing for a guerrilla operation in time for the pirates’ massive rally.<br/><br/>“We have taken all the Taiwanese players out of jail and helped them take back their weapons. That’s how we’re helping them now!”<br/><br/>After the core members of the Taiwanese players engaged in the guerrilla operation had been detained by the pirates, their operation almost fell flat, but the players of the Korean server dramatically appeared before them. It was a miracle for them.<br/><br/>Sungwoo sent Jisu to help the Taiwanese players with their operation, and they succeeded in rising up against the pirates, at last.<br/><br/>While Sungwoo was striking at the heart of the enemy camp, the Taiwanese players were closing in on the pirates from the outskirts.<br/><br/>“It seems like we have completely upset their applecart! Hahaha!”<br/><br/>With the appearance of the Necromancer, the fate of the Taiwanese, Chinese, and Korean servers began to change drastically.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Sungwoo was facing Gen. Chongong.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>He could behead Gen. Chongong at any moment, but he thought the general might have a hidden weapon, given that he was still standing upright.<br/><br/>At that moment, shouts came from everywhere.<br/><br/>“Uh! Are they our reinforcements?”<br/><br/>The camera operators on the Chinese server turned camera angles with a ray of hope.<br/><br/>But the shouting was not familiar to them. The shouting didn’t come from the pirates.<br/><br/>As expected, a couple of top officers came running from behind Gen Chongong and said, “General! Even Taiwanese players have rebelled against us!”<br/><br/>“We have to get off of this island right now! Let me take care of the resistance fighters, so please protect yourself!”<br/><br/>Gen. Chongong’s rally was also being broadcast live on the Taiwanese server to subjugate the Taiwanese players. However, with the scenes of Sungwoo attacking them out of the blue, the Taiwanese players began to rise up against Gen. Chongong and his players.<br/><br/>“No, we can<br/><br/>start over once we kill the Necromancer!” shouted Gen. Chongong.<br/><br/>He still didn’t give up as if he had something to rely on.<br/><br/>Then he took something out of his pocket and lifted it, which was familiar even to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Devil’s Gate?”<br/><br/>“Oh, you also know this. Then, you must know this is going to be the last moment of your life, right?”<br/><br/>It was the dungeon scroll “Devil’s Gate” at the recommended level 35, which Sungwoo also possessed. He heard that the pirates used it as a kind of strategic weapon because the monsters there were so strong.<br/><br/>Realizing that he couldn’t beat the Necromancer, Gen. Chongong intended to devastate this area. He tore the scroll without any hesitation.<br/><br/>At that moment, a warning message appeared before their eyes.<br/><br/>– Caution!  has opened in the affected area.<br/><br/>* The area has been closed. (Taipei City)<br/><br/>‘Blockade? That’s why they use it as a strategic weapon.’<br/><br/>As soon as the door of the Devil’s Gate was opened, Sungwoo couldn’t escape from the area. The door of the Devil’s Gate was maintained for 24 hours immediately after the scroll was used. It meant that Sungwoo had to survive by fighting against the monsters coming out of the dungeon for one day.<br/><br/>“Hhhhhhhhhhhhh! You’re all done!”<br/><br/>In the meantime, Gen. Chongong pulled out another item. It was a necklace made of the skull of a mouse. Given that it was covered in a blue aura, it seemed to contain some magical power.<br/><br/>“Now, only I am no longer the target of the monsters. Necromancer! You will be killed after you are ripped apart by the crazy monsters!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo tried to approach him, but at that moment, a purple portal opened between the two.<br/><br/>Whooooooooo-<br/><br/>The portal sucked in the air around the area and gradually swelled. Sungwoo, who was standing right in front of it, had to bend his legs and lower himself not to be dragged by the wind.<br/><br/>Googoogooo-<br/><br/>The space inside the portal rotated counterclockwise and tangled back and forth. Just looking at the place made Sungwoo feel as if he lost a sense of space.<br/><br/>And a black hand popped out of it suddenly.<br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/>“Something ominous?”<br/><br/>The camera operators filming the scene felt anxious even though they were inside the wizard’s shield.<br/><br/>-The strange energies of the two worlds are colliding with each other.<br/><br/>* The existence of both worlds adversely affects each other.<br/><br/>Something strange was happening.<br/><br/>Then, the long forearms and thorny shoulders squeezed out, and a head with no eyes or nose, only nasty teeth, popped out.<br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr…<br/><br/>The monster revealed his gums and dropped his sticky saliva.<br/><br/>“Damn it! I can’t move my legs!”<br/><br/>Most of the players felt that their bodies got stiff just by looking at the monster. Just like a predator facing a greater beast, they felt something like an ultra-low frequency was penetrating their bodies<br/><br/>-You are overwhelmed by the ‘alien being.’<br/><br/>* All your stats decrease. (-20%)<br/><br/>They were stricken by an unfamiliar fear, which made their muscles tight.<br/><br/>Tramp, tramp! </div><h2 id="chapter186">Chapter 186</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>The monster’s body came out of the portal. His slim and sleek black body was similar to a human body, but his face with unclear features and horns protruding from the whole body showed that he was not from this world.<br/><br/>He looked around, darting his long tongue in and out as if he was looking for his first meal.<br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/>However, he could not help but fix his eyes on one man, namely the Necromancer, who had a stronger presence than anybody else in this place.<br/><br/>Kaaaaak! Kaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>As if he was embarrassed by the Necromancer, he stepped back.<br/><br/>-Your deity status drastically lowers the stats of the ‘lower demon’. (-30%)<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>Just like the players had been overwhelmed by the alien beings earlier, the Necromancer overwhelmed this alien being thanks to his demigod trait.<br/><br/>“I think something better than I thought would happen.”<br/><br/>The next moment, Sungwoo jumped off the ground, grabbed the monster’s chin, and struck him down to the ground.<br/><br/>Thud-<br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo swung the Grim Reaper, trampling on his head with his right foot. The broad blade of his sword tore his tough skin and smashed his bones.<br/><br/>Sungwoo beheaded the monster in an instant.<br/><br/>-You have earned 500,000 gold by hunting an ‘alien being (lower monster)’.<br/><br/>Despite his threatening appearance, he helplessly collapsed, hit by the Necromancer’s fatal attack. Gen. Chongong could not hide the embarrassment on his face.<br/><br/>“Who the hell are you?”<br/><br/>Gen. Chongong’s Devil’s Gate was his last resort. It was a self-destruction attack he launched thinking he would start all over after killing the Necromancer.<br/><br/>But the Necromancer killed his opponent so easily.<br/><br/>Of course, there were more low-level monsters, but the Necromancer could destroy the monsters that he thought of as a strategic weapon.<br/><br/>Gen. Chongong could not believe what happened.<br/><br/>“Who the hell are you? What is your identity?” Gen. Chongong asked, aghast at Sungwoo’s incredible fighting, but Sungwoo focused on something else.<br/><br/>-You can make an alien being a subordinate spirit.<br/><br/>‘What the heck is this alien being?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo watched the swirling portal. To know what this alien being was, he had to go into the portal.<br/><br/>The portal will stay open for the next 24 hours. However, his demigod status would be canceled in the next 39 minutes. In other words, the remaining time for him was only 39 minutes.<br/><br/>‘It’s like a gamble to go into it.”<br/><br/>If he couldn’t get out of the swirling portal in 39 minutes, he might have to fight a hard battle while enduring the enormous aftereffects of his canceled demigod status.<br/><br/>‘I am not sure if I can endure even outside if these monsters keep coming out for 24 hours. Can I block them?’<br/><br/>That wasn’t just a problem for Sungwoo.<br/><br/>[Hidden Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: In front of the Devil’s Gate<br/><br/>-Type: Survival<br/><br/>-Goal: Survive for 24 hours.<br/><br/>-Reward: C-class EXP card, additional differential reward.<br/><br/>*A curse has arrived on this earth that you cannot bear. The ‘Devil’s Gate’ has opened. Soon, beings from the alien world will come out and trample everything on this earth.<br/><br/>There is not much you can do. Just do everything you can to survive.<br/><br/>* The devil monster can detect living things within a certain distance.<br/><br/>*When you hunt the devil monster, you will be issued an ‘additional reward’ after the quest ends.<br/><br/>This “Survival Quest” was given to all players in Taipei. Given that it was not a quest like ‘Attack the Dungeon,’ it seemed that the average level of the players was far below the proper level of the ‘Devil’s Gate.’<br/><br/>However, only Sungwoo was given a different quest.<br/><br/>[Exclusive Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: Guardian’s Duty<br/><br/>-Type: Remove target<br/><br/>-Goal: Remove the boss monster ‘Devil’s Gate Gatekeeper’<br/><br/>-Reward: Choose ‘regular deity status’ or ‘job change right’<br/><br/>*The alien beings have begun to invade this earth. You have a duty to defend this land as the ‘Guardian’ who once defeated the head of the alien beings. If you remove the key figure (boss monster) of the invading force, you will be able to send a strong warning message to the invaders.<br/><br/>* The boss monster ‘Devil’s Gate Gatekeeper’ will appear after the ‘Second Wave’ is over.<br/><br/>* If you fail to kill the target within 24 hours, you may be deprived of the title of ‘Guardian.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo obtained the title ‘Guardian,’ along with the title of ‘Hell Repeller,’ and that’s why he was given a different quest.<br/><br/>‘By the way, what the heck is ‘regular deity status’?<br/><br/>Of course, what the deity status here meant was his demigod status. Until now, Sungwoo has been able to temporarily gain Anubis’ power through his change to Lich and the human beast ampoule.<br/><br/>‘However, Kangsok Han has always been in Demigod status. In other words, he has a regular deity status.’<br/><br/>Kangsok once told him that his demigod status was temporary, so he needed to learn it by himself to get its full power.<br/><br/>‘I think such an opportunity has finally come along.’<br/><br/>-While you are proceeding with the Guardian’s Quest, the cooldown of all your skills will be reduced. (-60%)<br/><br/>At that moment, a tremendous vibration came out from the Devil’s Gate.<br/><br/>Gugugugugugugu―<br/><br/>-The ‘1st Invasion Wave’ has begun at the Devil’s Gate.<br/><br/>“Alright, I think I can hunt these expensive monsters to my heart’s content.”<br/><br/>It seemed that Sungwoo’s enemies always gave him quality EXP.<br/><br/>So, he gathered all the undead in front of the portal. He intended to show the invaders what hell was.<br/><br/>Now, everyone’s eyes turned to the portal where a tremendous vibration was coming out.<br/><br/>‘Now is the time!’<br/><br/>Gen. Chongong turned around. When he confirmed that his last resort failed, he had no choice but to flee the scene. He hurriedly moved while the Necromancer was distracted by the devil monsters. Since he was protected by a special spell, Gen. Chongong would not be attacked by devil monsters. So, his life would be spared if he could hide it in a place invisible to the Necromancer.<br/><br/>However, just before going down the stairs after he went around the building, a skeleton blocked him.<br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/>It was a goblin skeleton.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>The skeleton charged at him, swinging his sword.<br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/>Gen. Chongong grabbed his stomach and fell over.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>Gen. Chongong had little experience in combat, not to mention combat skills because he was protected by the numerous subordinates he had brainwashed.<br/><br/>As a result, he could not cope with the attack of a mere skeleton.<br/><br/>“I see. So, you want to escape alone when things don’t work out for you, right? Is that all you can take responsibility for?”<br/><br/>The Necromancer arrived and stood in front of him.<br/><br/>“Oh, my God… I heard that you had been serving the Angel race for a long time. Can I take this as the level of the players who are relying on the Absolute Race?”<br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo turned his head to somebody behind him. He was the camera operator of the Korean server who had been with Hanho until a little while ago.<br/><br/>Sungwoo slowly opened his mouth, looking at the camera.<br/><br/>“How do you believe in this kind of man and the Absolute Race who has this kind of man?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo asked the Korean server.<br/><br/>“Of course, I could never believe in them!”<br/><br/>After he said that, Sungwoo lifted the Grim Reaper.<br/><br/>“Oh, no! Wait a second!” Gen. Chongong shouted.<br/><br/>Sungwoo shook his head and said, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have time because I have to take care of what you’ve messed up here…”<br/><br/>He struck down the general with the Grim Reaper.<br/><br/>-You have acquired 340,000 gold by killing the “executive player” of the Angel camp.<br/><br/>As always, those who confronted the Necromancer faced a miserable last moment.<br/><br/>This time, Sungwoo collected much more gold from him than a normal player as a reward.<br/><br/>In this way, the Absolute Race induced each faction to attack each other.<br/><br/>‘Oh, I heard the necklace is protecting him.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo took the necklace item in the shape of a rat skull from his neck.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: The Devil’s Gate key<br/><br/>-Class: Unknown<br/><br/>-Category: Necklace<br/><br/>-Effect: Mana increases (+100)<br/><br/>-Description: When you wear it, you are excluded from the target of the devil monster. But you can get the effect by offering up a human sacrifice to the Devil’s Gate periodically. (Remaining period: 13 days)<br/><br/>*Whenever you renew the validity period, you can get a ‘Devil’s Gate’ item.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was not sure exactly what Gen. Chongong’s job was, but it was clear that he continued to offer up human sacrifices to the Devil’s Gate, aside from brainwashing the low-level players.<br/><br/>In other words, Gen. Chongong was like a pseudo-religious leader who served the devil.<br/><br/>-Angel camp’s bounty on your head has been increased.<br/><br/>* Angel camp’s new reward: 75,000,000 gold<br/><br/>It seemed that the Angel camp’s anger toward the Necromancer had intensified after he killed Gen. Chongong. However, simply raising the bounty didn’t mean they could stop Sungwoo.<br/><br/>‘Is this amount all they can increase under the grand name of Absolute Race?’<br/><br/>The Devil’s Gate now began to vibrate more violently.<br/><br/>Sungwoo turned around, thinking to himself, ‘Someday I will confront the Absolute Race itself directly.’<br/><br/>The system certainly wanted such an exciting situation, but it was good for his leveling up for him to deal with them directly. </div><h2 id="chapter187">Chapter 187</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            A total of 25 players were moving between the buildings. A road sign above their heads indicated they were going to Suwon.<br/><br/>“We’re almost there! Suwon Palace is around the corner. We’ll move after a 10-minute break.”<br/><br/>They hid in the alley and began to rest. In the meantime, some of them were on sentry guard, which suggested that they were an organized group.<br/><br/>“Captain, is it true that we have received 3.5 million gold for this service? Isn’t it the highest amount until now?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know how much they agreed to pay us, but given the strength of our opponent, we have to receive a lot this time.”<br/><br/>The name of their organization was the “Hunter Company,” a group that those players who frequently used the Korean server community would have heard of at least once because they uploaded promotional posts about their activities several times a day.<br/><br/>The threads they posted were as follows.<br/><br/>[501] If you need mercenaries, please contact us.<br/><br/>-Write: Captain Yang │ Hits: 1,413<br/><br/>*We are the Hunter Company, a group of 122 mercenaries. We take care of everything when you need force. (Monster hunting, dungeon crackdown, security, combat, etc.)<br/><br/>As of now, the average level of our members is 10, and in some cases, we can run a party with level 13 higher. (Maximum two teams with ten members available.)<br/><br/>Expenses are determined after you consult with us, but we may ask for additional charges afterward. We’re running our company based on trust. If you trust us and leave your work with us, we’ll never disappoint you.<br/><br/>[Comment: 1]<br/><br/>What do the players in the perished world need but avoid the most? It would be them fighting at the risk of their own lives. It was the Hunter Company that realized they could make lots of money by providing mercenary services. They were marketing their armed forces widely to earn a lot of gold. In short, they were mercenaries.<br/><br/>According to the terms of the contract, anybody who signed the contract was supposed to upload their review of their service on the community bulletin, so rumors about this company spread widely, attracting lots of customers.<br/><br/>“3.5 million gold? Well, this is pretty good, but I don’t think many would come out for this job. Look at the 1st League guys. Only a few of them have applied.”<br/><br/>This was a big job with a lot of money at stake, but the Hunter Company members looked nervous, even though they were professional mercenaries, their target was very unusual and extraordinary.<br/><br/>“Damn it! How come our target is the Necromancer? Are we going to be okay? Just watching him fighting scares me.”<br/><br/>The captain frowned at one of his members’ diffident attitude.<br/><br/>“What is the problem? We will be alright as long as we can hide our identities. Anyway, he is destined to get stuck in Taiwan for 24 hours. During that time we can attack his stronghold and escape.”<br/><br/>The leaders of the Hunter Company knew well that it would be crazy to attack the Necromancer, but okayed the contract because their professional mercenaries would not deal with him directly.<br/><br/>Their target was not the Necromancer himself, but his stronghold and those around him.<br/><br/>“Yes, that’s right. By the way, what’s this Evolutionary Society? Who are these guys belonging to that organization? Just hearing the name makes me feel they are not normal.”<br/><br/>“Hey, stop talking bullshit! No matter what, we should not leak our client’s name to the outside. So, shut up!”<br/><br/>“Absolutely!’<br/><br/>It was none other than Evolution Society that hired them. Since they lost many members during the raid in Pyongtaek, they were not in a position to confront the Necromancer directly. So, they signed a contract with the Hunter Company, which had recently gained fame and trust, to attack the Necromancer’s hometown, Suwon village.<br/><br/>The captain of the team took out a canteen and drank water.<br/><br/>Then, he stood up and said, “24 hours is enough for us to destroy a building housing 200 people quickly and get out safely. According to our client, there is a strong invisible barrier around that area, but…”<br/><br/>The captain pulled something out of his pocket. It was an item given by the client called ‘Evolution Society’.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Mana Reflux Device<br/><br/>-Grade: Player Manufacturing<br/><br/>-Category: consumption<br/><br/>-Effect: You can reverse mana and destroy the spell.<br/><br/>-Description: Install this near the invisible barrier and inject mana. In about 10 minutes, it will make a hole in the barrier. Good luck. (Manufacturer’s skill)<br/><br/>“Okay, let’s move now. This time we’re going to tear down the stronghold of the Necromancer. No matter how strong he is, he won’t be able to survive if his stronghold collapses.”<br/><br/>They were certain that the Necromancer would not come back within 24 hours.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Around that time, the “Devil’s Gate,” which opened in front of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei, Taiwan, was shaking violently as if it would burst at any moment.<br/><br/>Gugung― Gugugu―<br/><br/>The Taiwanese players who rose up to reclaim Taiwan with Jisu attacked the heart of the pirates and quickly arrived at the square. They witnessed the white demons, namely the undead army, surrounding the Devil’s Gate.<br/><br/>“Well, is he the Necromancer?”<br/><br/>“Terrific!”<br/><br/>There were a total of 95 undead under the Necromancer’s control. All of them were wearing bone armor and holding bone shields and were not normal undead.<br/><br/>Armed with all sorts of synergies and buffs, they were truly the strongest army in existence.<br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/>Company organization (hidden)<br/> -Category: Synergy of the members<br/><br/>-Condition: Commander (Level 3) trait + 90 or more members<br/><br/>-Effect: Attack power increases (+7%), defense power increases (+7%), additional damage (+3%) when attacking a single enemy jointly<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shield dustproof (2nd stage)<br/><br/>-Category: Weapon synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: Equip at least 60 shields<br/><br/>-Effects: Shield defense increases (+10%), shield magic defense increases (+10%), shield attack increases (+30%), with shield attack, knockback rate increases (+15%), abnormal state resistance increases ( +20%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Giant (Step 5)<br/><br/>-Category: Trait synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: 50 or more ‘Giant’ traits<br/><br/>-Effect: Reduces damage by small and medium opponents (-40%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ironclad Knight (Stage 7)<br/><br/>-Category: Armor synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: Install more than 70 ‘Full Plate Armor’<br/><br/>-Effect: Increases armor defense (+45%), forms a shield equivalent to 45% of defense.<br/><br/>Based on his fighting experiences so far, Sungwoo carefully selected synergies specialized in defense against multiple attacks.<br/><br/>But this was not all.<br/><br/>-You have strengthened the undead with exploited souls.

As a result, he enjoyed a huge increase in power.<br/><br/>The Necromancer grew stronger with more battles. It was this immortal army of undead that verified Sungwoo’s power.<br/><br/>‘The portal entrance is narrow. If we block this and get rid of them popping out of the portal, we can easily defeat them with an overwhelming advantage.’<br/><br/>After confirming the warning message on the survival, most players already started thinking of running away and hiding.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo’s goal was different. He could make the decision boldly because he was preparing to hunt, not merely survive.<br/><br/>-The ‘1st Wave’ of the Devil’s Gate has begun.<br/><br/>It has finally begun.<br/><br/>Gugugugugugugu!<br/><br/>With tremendous vibration, black hands popped out from the portal’s entrance.<br/><br/>Kaak! Kaak! Kaak!<br/><br/>The ‘low-level monsters’, one of whom Sungwoo had already hunted, began to crawl out, making disgusting sounds, like a swarm of insects born in an ootheca.<br/><br/>-Your deity status drastically reduces the stats of the ‘low-level monster’. (-30%)<br/><br/>“Attack!”<br/><br/>The moment the monsters pushed their heads outside the portal, the undead blocking the entrance moved swiftly.<br/><br/>Two-woong! Two-woong!<br/><br/>Troll skeletons triggered the slingshots and human beast skeletons threw javelins at them. Their target was a circular portal that was only 3 meters wide. They hit the target accurately.<br/><br/>-You have earned 500,000 gold by hunting ‘alien beings (lower monsters)’.<br/><br/>-You have exploited a soul. (14 items)<br/><br/>-You have earned 500,000 gold by hunting ‘alien beings (lower monsters)’.<br/><br/>-You have exploited a soul. (15 items)<br/><br/>-You have earned 500,000 gold by hunting ‘alien beings (lower monsters)’.<br/><br/>-You have exploited a soul. (16 items)<br/><br/>Most of the monsters that came out first could not withstand the fierce attack and bounced back into the portal. Those who didn’t were shattered and fell to the ground.<br/><br/>The entrance of the portal was too narrow for them to counterattack. Besides, Sungwoo’s undead army blocking the entrance was too strong.<br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>Two demons succeeded in coming out from the portal for a few steps, but they were caught in the explosions and bounced in front of the undead army. The skeletons immediately threw long spears at the monsters.<br/><br/>-1st Wave underway (13%) </div><h2 id="chapter188">Chapter 188</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Did one minute pass? Sungwoo’s undead army already slaughtered dozens of monsters.<br/><br/>If they kept up the attack like this, they could finish the 1st Wave within 10 minutes.<br/><br/>’24 hours? No, as things stand now, just 30 minutes is enough.’<br/><br/>-Grim Reaper retention time (00:26:33)<br/><br/>-Werewolf retention time (00:27:01)<br/><br/>If Sungwoo didn’t succeed within that time frame, the situation might turn very unfavorable because the moment Sungwoo’s Anubis status was deactivated, his strength would be reduced by half. If that happened, Sungwoo’s undead army couldn’t protect the entrance, and eventually, they would be surrounded and annihilated.<br/><br/>‘No matter what, I have to destroy them right now.’<br/><br/>-1st Wave Underway (17%)<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo used all his skills.<br/><br/>-‘Evil Spirit Bomb’ has been embedded into your weapon.<br/><br/>He concentrated all his firepower ranging from corpse explosions to evil spirit bombs on the narrow portal.<br/><br/>“Everyone, support the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>Furthermore, even the Taiwanese players Jisu brought with her joined the attack. Standing behind the undead army, they began to mount a ranged attack on the portal.<br/><br/>And all the scenes of them attacking the portal were broadcast live.<br/><br/>“Wow! That’s the best of the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>“He never loses.”<br/><br/>The players of Kanghwa Island, who gathered together, were cheering for him.<br/><br/>“I told you so! That’s why we have to rely on him, no matter what.”<br/><br/>Heyon was excited. Even when their doubts about the Necromancer prevailed amid his controversial role with the third camp, only she made the case for their unconditional support for the Necromancer. Her decision was excellent.<br/><br/>Not only them but also all the players on the Korean server were duly expecting the Necromancer to play a big role. At the moment, more than 100,000 viewers were watching what was happening in Taiwan.<br/><br/>Junghoon and the Crusader Team members were also watching the broadcast.<br/><br/>“How could he get stronger like that?”<br/><br/>They just arrived at Cheongnyangni Station to fight the Demon camp.<br/><br/>However, they had to fight against not only the Demon camp but also Sungwoo’s camp. Aside from what was going on now, the Necromancer, who could become their ultimate boss in the future, was showing his full power, so it was foolish for them to miss the scenes of his fighting.<br/><br/>“Commander, I’m sorry to say this, but I don’t think we should confront Sungwoo.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>They thought they knew him well. They also knew his growth was amazing. But he always showed more than what they expected.<br/><br/>In short, the Necromancer was unpredictable.<br/><br/>“What the heck is that Devil’s Gate? You saw him hunting the monsters so easily, right? If that’s the case, aren’t the monsters as weak as Kobold?”<br/><br/>Yoon Kang, who ruined the broadcast because of the Necromancer, complained alone. He didn’t want to admit the Necromancer’s extraordinary capabilities.<br/><br/>But he couldn’t open his mouth after watching what the Necromancer did next.<br/><br/>A devil monster stepped forward with his companion’s body as a shield. Then, he easily jumped over the siege of the undead army. He jumped a whopping 15 meters away at once.<br/><br/>In the process, he caused a great disaster. The moment he passed by, four Taiwanese players fell on the ground.<br/><br/>Kaak! Kaak!<br/><br/>Wielding his long arm like a whip, he broke everything standing in the way including the concrete floor, marble stairs, iron street lights. So much so that those watching him thought he had a mechanical cutter on both arms.<br/><br/>“Tankers! Move to block the monster!”<br/><br/>Although the tankers came running and lifted the shields, not only the shields but also their arms were cut instantly.<br/><br/>“Gosh! That devil monster is too strong!”<br/><br/>It would never be easy for anybody, even at level 35, to receive 500,000 gold to hunt that devil monster.<br/><br/>In that respect, Sungwoo was extraordinary and very usual because he could decrease the devil monster’s stats by 30% with his overwhelming stats in his demigod form.<br/><br/>“Everybody, move back!”<br/><br/>Jisu walked out of the terrified tankers. Except for the Necromancer, she was the only player who could face the devil monster.<br/><br/>At that moment, the monster swung his arm toward her.<br/><br/>When she avoided it, the ground on which she was standing disintegrated like a glass. But one of his nails touched her shoulder. A handful of her hair was cut immediately.<br/><br/>‘He’s super fast.’<br/><br/>Jisu stepped back, embarrassed. The moment she let down her guard, she would be killed. However, if she could attack him at the right moment, she could also kill him right away.<br/><br/>Hooooook!<br/><br/>‘Now is the time!’<br/><br/>The moment the evil monster stretched out his left hand, she swung her sword using her sword skill. Her target was his right arm. The moment she blocked his attack, she cut his right shoulder in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>The monster staggered with his mouth wide open. Seizing the moment, Jisu darted toward him using the “Footprint Tracking” skill, then beheaded him right away.<br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 17)<br/><br/>Jisu ignored the level-up message and looked at Sungwoo while catching her breath.<br/><br/>It was quiet in the area where Sungwoo and his undead army had been attacking the portal.<br/><br/>-1st Wave of the Devil’s Gate has been completed. The next wave begins in 20 seconds.<br/><br/>The first battle was over. There was only one devil monster that the Necromancer allowed out of the portal. All the other devil monsters were killed as soon as they came out of the entrance of the portal.<br/><br/>-The 2nd Wave of the Devil’s Gate begins.<br/><br/>And the Necromancer’s second slaughter began, which was much faster than they expected.<br/><br/>-This area is protected by ‘the Shade of the Godly Tree’.<br/><br/>* You are not a player who has been allowed access to this area.<br/><br/>The mercenaries of the Hunter Company faced an unknown invisible barrier as they previously heard. They were in the process of installing the item given by the Evolutionary Society.<br/><br/>“Captain, are you sure the Necromancer can’t move for 24 hours? I am monitoring the broadcast right now, but…”<br/><br/>He has been monitoring the Necromancer’s broadcast until today, so he grew more and more nervous.<br/><br/>“This is a unilateral fight…”<br/><br/>The Necromancer’s performance was overwhelming, to say the least.<br/><br/>“No matter how quickly he cleared the quest, how could he come to Taiwan so quickly?” the captain replied.<br/><br/>“Then, how could he approach the square?”<br/><br/>None of them were sure because they never predicted the Necromancer would appear in Taiwan.<br/><br/>“Damn it! Let’s get out of here as soon as possible after installing it…”<br/><br/>Even the captain could not hide his anxiety. They knew well that the Necromancer could show his extraordinary skills and come back sooner than expected.<br/><br/>‘It’s impossible for him to cross the sea in a few hours. Of course, he can’t!’<br/><br/>If there was no Necromancer, they thought they could easily blow away a whole village.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Wave 2 was much more intense. Stronger devil monsters popped out like a swarm of ants from an ant den. However, the Necromancer’s siege was perfect.<br/><br/>-The 2nd Wave of the Devil’s Gate has been completed. The next wave begins in 20 seconds.<br/><br/>But three of them escaped the siege, so the Taiwanese players in the rear got into trouble.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Jisu succeeded in killing them all, but she suffered some deep wounds in several places.<br/><br/>“Realign the players! Supply recovery potions! We don’t have much time left.”<br/><br/>“Everyone, prepare the magic!”<br/><br/>Given the level of the monsters, it was fortunate that the damages Jisu and the players suffered were not that heavy.<br/><br/>Had it not been for the Necromancer, they might have been fiercely fighting the monsters in downtown Taipei by now.<br/><br/>-Grim Reaper retention time (00:08:23)<br/><br/>-Werewolf retention time (00:08:51)<br/><br/>‘I’ve got only eight minutes left.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo had only 8 minutes. And it was time for the ‘Devil’s Gate Gatekeeper’ to appear. In other words, Sungwoo had to get rid of that monster within eight minutes.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Sungwoo closed in on the siege by moving the undead army toward the portal. Sungwoo was going to launch a total offensive without giving the monster any chance to escape right after the latter appeared.<br/><br/>-The ‘Final Wave’ of the Devil’s Gate has begun.<br/><br/>Finally, the final battle has started.<br/><br/>‘Uh?” </div><h2 id="chapter189">Chapter 189</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Suddenly, Sungwoo felt some unknown anxiety. Something that could not be explained by human senses was flowing from the inside of the portal. It was something like a small particle.<br/><br/>‘This is dangerous. It will kill me!’<br/><br/>As soon as he thought about it, he threw himself out of the place instinctively. At that moment, a red ray of light poured out of the portal.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The red ray of light wiped out the place where Sungwoo was standing and broke down one side of their siege.<br/><br/>Although they were given all kinds of defense buffs, Sungwoo’s undead skeletons were shattered and scattered in all directions.<br/><br/>“Damn it.”<br/><br/>Since Sungwoo was in a werewolf’s body, he could detect the strange atmosphere.<br/><br/>Normally, he would have been wiped out by that light without even feeling it.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the monster in question appeared out of the portal.<br/><br/>He was the boss monster, ‘The Gatekeeper of the Devil’s Gate.’<br/><br/>The monster was about 10 meters tall, with no eyes and nose as expected. His mouth was decorated with savage teeth as if they were attached with obsidian. There were horns and bumps all over his body, which wrapped him like armor.<br/><br/>The most bizarre thing about the monster was the cane he was holding in his right hand. It was a long, veined pole with<br/><br/>a studded woman’s torso at the end.<br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrr…<br/><br/>-You are overwhelmed by the overwhelming presence of an alien being.<br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-50%)<br/><br/>Not only did Sungwoo’s demigod status fail to activate, but also normal players saw half of their stats decreasing.<br/><br/>“Argh!!”<br/><br/>“Oh, no! I can hardly breathe…”<br/><br/>Not only did their stats drop, but they couldn’t move because they got frozen on the spot. Aside from confronting the monster, they could not even face the monster properly because of the big difference in level.<br/><br/>‘This is a dangerous situation.’<br/><br/>Even Sungwoo felt anxious. No matter how strong his opponent was, Sungwoo could find his soft spot while attacking him, and that’s the way he killed the boss monsters until now. So, he thought this monster was not an exception.<br/><br/>But his biggest problem was time.<br/><br/>-Grim Reaper retention time (00:07:20)<br/><br/>-Werewolf retention time (00:07:48)<br/><br/>The monster lifted the staff. At that moment, a red light flashed and a beam of enormous size came out.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s undead army, who never seemed to collapse, fell like a toy block.<br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/>Of course, Sungwoo could not allow his attack to continue. The Ogre Skeleton jumped out of the collapsing undead skeletons, stretching out his right arm using his blitz skill.<br/><br/>However, the monster formed a shield just by lifting the cane. Although he hit the shield with his blitz skill, his attack didn’t inflict any fatal damage on the monster, who was only pushed back one step.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Then, Ogre Skeleton charged at the monster, punching his fists at his head. Since Ogre Skeleton had a fighting trait, he could make the fight favorable to him on the battlefield.<br/><br/>To support Ogre Skeleton, Bone Drake also came running at the monster to push him down with tremendous force.<br/><br/>At that moment, however, the monster’s horns and protrusions arose like springs. They moved autonomously like the tentacles of a jellyfish and began to tear apart everything around him.<br/><br/>As a result, Ogre Skeleton and Bone Drake were shattered into hundreds of pieces and scattered. It was like he put them in a blender.<br/><br/>“What happened a moment ago?”<br/><br/>“This is unbelievable!”<br/><br/>The monster destroying them was so shocking to those watching the scenes.<br/><br/>“This can’t happen! I’ve never seen this kind of annihilation before…”<br/><br/>Hanho, who was guarding the camera, uttered in confusion. The two large skeletons, the strongest weapons Sungwoo possessed, were smashed without leaving behind any traces.<br/><br/>Of course, they would be revived anyway, but Hanho also knew that Sungwoo’s condition in Lich would end soon.<br/><br/>“As things stand now…”<br/><br/>[Real time chat]<br/><br/>─ 4th hand: What the heck happened a moment ago?<br/><br/>─ Jack Kim: The Necromancer’s army has been instantly annihilated.<br/><br/>─ Incheon Mango: Is this the end of the Necromancer?<br/><br/>─ Yasuo 1: Lol, finally they are going to be done.<br/><br/>─ Gwangmyeong Brown Bear: How can you hunt that devil monster? It looks like it’s impossible.<br/><br/>─ Wando Youth: Please run away. I don’t want to see the Necromancer being killed. We have no hope in this game if this man is killed.<br/><br/>Numerous viewers watching their fight were astonished because the monster easily pushed out the Necromancer, who fought with an overwhelming force until a moment ago.<br/><br/>Tramp- Tramp-<br/><br/>After neutralizing all the nearby undead, the monster started approaching the Necromancer. However, the Necromancer was still standing in his place, not trying to move at all.<br/><br/>Could it be that he got frozen? Was that why he couldn’t run away?<br/><br/>“Sungwoo? Why are you standing there?”<br/><br/>“Why is he standing so silently?”<br/><br/>Everyone was watching him, holding their breath. If he didn’t take any action, the scene of the monster ripping apart the Necromancer would be broadcasted live.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo?” Jisu lifted the sword. Even right now she could charge at the monster and attack him, using her “Footprint Tracking” skill. But she couldn’t easily try it. Could she avoid the monster’s numerous horns and protrusions?<br/><br/>At that moment, some incomprehensible phenomenon occurred.<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is the monster doing?”<br/><br/>The monster passed by the Necromancer as if he didn’t see anything.<br/><br/>Tramp- Tramp-<br/><br/>While watching it, Hanho saw a strange object on Sungwoo’s neck.<br/><br/>“Ah, isn’t it a necklace?”<br/><br/>The unidentified item erased the Necromancer from the monster’s target list<br/><br/>When the monster passed by, the Necromancer gently lifted a giant scythe from his behind.<br/><br/>-‘Evil Spirit Bombing’ has been embedded in your weapon. (MAX)<br/><br/>Sungwoo used 50 souls to prepare for a massive ‘Evil Spirit Bombing.’<br/><br/>It was a destructive force that could crumple a truck using just one soul.<br/><br/>What if Sungwoo prepared 50?<br/><br/>‘I don’t have to drag it on. Let me kill him with one single bombing.’<br/><br/>Then, he turned his head to the Gatekeeper of the Devil’s Gate and slowly pulled out his necklace with his left hand.<br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/>The monster suddenly stopped because he felt something strange behind him. Then, he turned. Sungwoo swung the Grim Reaper and fired the “Evil Spirit Bombing’ at him.<br/><br/>Kaah!<br/><br/>The monster lifted his cane, but it was too late. Black spheres were approaching his body.<br/><br/>Goong-Go-Go-Go-Go-Goong!<br/><br/>Fifty spheres exploded, and black waves spread. This unknown energy crushed everything it touched. Great pressure pressed down on the monster, so much so that even space looked like it was bending.<br/><br/>Even the ground could not withstand its impact. As if a meteorite fell on the ground, the surrounding ground sank, sucking the monster into the pit.<br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/>The monster fell to his knees. He was still breathing, but he was on the cusp of dying. This was the last chance for Sungwoo to attack him.<br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately prepared the next attack.<br/><br/>-‘Twilight Raid’ has begun.<br/><br/>Wooooooooooooooooo!<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s body assimilated 20 souls. Then, he flew to the monster. A black tornado struck and crushed the monster, inflicting enormous magic damage.<br/><br/>And the moment the tornado disappeared, the “ghosts’ hands” came up from the ground and tightly tied his body.<br/><br/>“Now is the time!”<br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo shouted, dozens of undead skeletons threw themselves into the pit just like they did in a horror movie,<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Sungwoo launched a total attack on the defenseless monster. He mobilized all damage skills featuring slamming and biting.<br/><br/>Sungwoo shot his hand cannon and swung the Grim Reaper.<br/><br/>At the last moment, Minsok stabbed the sword into the monster’s chest.<br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/>-You have earned 7,800,000 gold by hunting the boss monster ‘Devil’s Gate Gatekeeper’.<br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 22)<br/><br/>-Time remaining until credentials: 1,932 days<br/><br/>-You have acquired the title of ‘Devil’s Gate Hunter’.<br/><br/>* Muscle strength increases (+3)<br/><br/>* Agility increases (+3)<br/><br/>* Curse immunity Increases (+10%)<br/><br/>“Whew!”<br/><br/>“He was a really dangerous guy.”<br/><br/>The fact that he leveled up to 22 from level 21 right after he killed the Devil’s Gate Gatekeeper showed how dangerous the monster was.<br/><br/>-Choose a level up card.<br/><br/>‘Summon Specter? It’s a new skill.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo chose No. 5.<br/><br/>-You have acquired the skill .<br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/>-Name: Summon Specter<br/><br/>-Grade: Basic<br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/>-Cost: 70 Mana<br/><br/>*You summon two “Specters”, a ghost with no shape.

                             <br/><br/>But their fight wasn’t over yet. They only stopped the wave of the devil monsters from coming out of the Devil’s Gate, but the basic obstacle to their further advance was the Gatekeeper.<br/><br/>So, it was time Sungwoo and his party stormed inside the gate after killing the Gatekeeper.<br/><br/>‘But just because we’re going in now, we can’t attack the monsters. Besides, my demigod status will be deactivated soon.’<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo gave up and walked toward the portal. He was wondering if there was any information he could get from there.<br/><br/>At that moment an unexpected message appeared.<br/><br/>-You can ‘save’ the stages of dungeon attack on the ‘Devil’s Gate’ scroll that you possess now.<br/><br/>*Caution! When you decide to save, the dungeon difficulty level will be increased by one level when you use the Devil’s Gate later.<br/><br/>‘Save?’<br/><br/>It seemed that some sort of function was given when he interacted with the Devil’s Gate item he had obtained from the container ship before.<br/><br/>And if the level of difficulty was higher, he would receive a better reward.<br/><br/>‘Of course, that’s fine with me.’<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo chose ‘save.’<br/><br/>-Item information (Devil’s Gate) has been changed.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: 2nd floor of the Devil’s Gate<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: Magic Scroll<br/><br/>-Effect: Opens the door of the Devil’s Gate for 36 hours when used.<br/><br/>-Description: Create a passage that connects with the Devil’s Gate. You can get very valuable items by exploring the inside of the Devil’s Gate, but we recommend that you don’t try it hastily. Don’t forget that someone might come out of the door that you can enter. (Recommended level 43)<br/><br/>“Let me go in by all means next time.”<br/><br/>When the save was over, the portal of the Devil’s Gate gradually began to shrink.<br/><br/>That meant the door was closed, and the quest was over.<br/><br/>“Wow! Wow! It’s over!”<br/><br/>“Incredible! We won.”<br/><br/>“Hooray, Necromancer!”<br/><br/>“Hurray!”<br/><br/>Cheers and shouts of joy came from all over. The Taiwanese players were not only liberated from the pirates but also survived the terrible hell called the Devil’s Gate.<br/><br/>And everyone couldn’t help but admit that it was the Necromancer of the Korean server who saved them.<br/><br/>-All stats decrease for 24 hours as a strong power gets drained out of your body. (-10)<br/><br/>Even before he knew it, Sungwoo’s demigod status was also at an end. Come to think of it, it was indeed a close call. If Sungwoo had come a little later, he would have not been able to kill the Gatekeeper.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the most important thing was the ‘exclusive quest’ that Sungwoo received when the door of the Devil’s Gate opened.<br/><br/>-You have successfully cleared the exclusive quest .<br/><br/>* You can choose a reward.<br/><br/>‘Right to change a job’ I don’t need to change my job. Hanho may want to.’<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo chose No. 1 without any hesitation, namely regular deity status. Changing to another job was unthinkable for him.<br/><br/>-You can choose the Regular Deity Status.<br/><br/>There seemed to be several gods related to death. However, the only one that Sungwoo could use for now was Anubis, the Egyptian god of death.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was curious about the abilities of the other deity statuses, but it was impossible to find out the conditions they required.<br/><br/>So, he chose No. 1.<br/><br/>-The regular deity status has been granted to you.<br/><br/>* God of Death: Anubis<br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/>-Name: Anubis’ Power (1st stage)<br/><br/>-Grade: Demigod<br/><br/>-Classification: Passive and Active<br/><br/>-Consumption: 0<br/><br/>For only one hour per day, you gain the power of ‘Anubis’ by gaining the deity status. All stats increase by (+10). You can use exclusive skills.<br/><br/>Now, he could maintain Anubis status without resorting to the ‘Human Beast Transformation ampoule’.<br/><br/>He felt it regrettable he could maintain Anubis status only one hour, but given that ‘1st stage’ was written next to the skill, it seemed that there was room for increasing it in the future.<br/><br/>At that moment, the Taiwanese players approached him.<br/><br/>One of them said, “Thank you very much. It would have taken much longer if we had tried to get rid of the devil monsters by ourselves.”<br/><br/>This man’s name was Chen. He had been rescued from a dungeon by Sungwoo’s party. After that, he returned to his organization and successfully carried out the guerrilla operations.<br/><br/>Of course, as Chen said, this mission would have been impossible without Sungwoo’s help.<br/><br/>Even if the Taiwanese players had succeeded in expelling the pirates, General Chongong would have opened the Devil’s Gate as the last resort.<br/><br/>So, the Taiwanese players expressed their gratitude to Sungwoo and his party several times.<br/><br/>“You’re our savior. If there is anything we can do to help you, please feel free to contact us. We will be the first to help you.”<br/><br/>“I will contact you someday.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo did not refuse such a request because it was certainly useful for him to have supporters like the players on Kanghwa Island.<br/><br/>Chen hesitated for a moment, then opened his mouth again.<br/><br/>“By the way, I heard you were preparing a third camp. If you don’t mind, can our players join and support you?”<br/><br/>It was never an easy choice for Chen to choose the third camp rather than the Absolute Race camp.<br/><br/>He might have hesitated to choose a nascent organization instead of the strongly established force despite its merits, but he made the decision. This meant he recognized that the Necromancer’s performance was great, and he accepted the Necromancer as a trustworthy ally.<br/><br/>Sungwoo replied, “I’m sorry, but I have not yet established the third camp. I want to ask you one question.”<br/><br/>“Sure, please go ahead.”<br/><br/>“Why do you want to choose the third camp?”<br/><br/>“That’s because…” Chen hesitated.<br/><br/>Then, the woman standing behind him opened her mouth.<br/><br/>“Because of our safety. There is nothing more important than our safety. We’ve already been beaten by the pirates.”<br/><br/>Chen nodded as if he agreed with her.<br/><br/>Sungwoo shook his head and said, “If you want to survive by relying on us, you’d rather choose the Absolute Race. I can’t provide a security cover for you.”<br/><br/>“Really? Then, what is the goal of the third camp?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t help but think hard about his question.<br/><br/>‘Goal?’<br/><br/>He chose the third camp by chance. However, the reason that Sungwoo boldly broke the Angel statue was that he had the conviction that there was something possible only when he got out of the Absolute Race’s grip.<br/><br/>“Well, my goal is to resolve this ridiculous phenomenon.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s goal was not just to survive but to resolve this strange and absurd situation they were faced with at the moment. Ironically, that was also the way for them to survive.<br/><br/>“I’m not going to recklessly accept anybody who wants to join us. I’m going to gather only qualified people and resolve this situation.”<br/><br/>There was a momentary silence.<br/><br/>“Then, we are not qualified to join you,” said Chen calmly, but there was self-mockery in his voice because they had been detained by the pirates until this morning.<br/><br/>“If you want to solve this hellish situation, you have to be able to protect yourself and your family first. Let me turn off the broadcast now.”<br/><br/>After he said that, the broadcast ended.<br/><br/>The activities and goals of the third camp were broadcast to the entire Korean server. And now those on the Korean server were contemplating whether to choose the third camp or the Absolute Race.<br/><br/>-You have successfully cleared the camp quest .<br/><br/>*A reward is given to you. (Camp skills, camp items)<br/><br/>In other words, Sungwoo’s propaganda broadcast was successful.<br/><br/>However, the fight was not over yet.<br/><br/>Hanho rushed to Sungwoo, holding a cell phone in hand. He must have received some message.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo! An emergency call from the village!”<br/><br/>“What happened?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo had asked the villagers to contact him whenever they encountered emergencies because he could go back to the village immediately using his ‘Return’ skill.<br/><br/>“It seems some outsiders attacked them while we were away from them.”<br/><br/>“What did you say?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo hastily prepared his return skill. The fact that the village was attacked meant the world tree was in danger.<br/><br/>But Hanho said, waving his hand hastily, “No, you don’t have to go back. The village players have captured all the attackers.”<br/><br/>Was Sungwoo too worried?<br/><br/>The village players already became strong enough to protect themselves. </div><h2 id="chapter191">Chapter 191</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The world has become like a game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first, everyone questioned whether the world could change like a game. They questioned who the hell was responsible. Was it the conspiracy of the corporates? Or was it God’s play? If they were not responsible, was it a dream?<br/><br/><br/><br/>But nobody cared about it soon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What was important to them was not who gave the quest.

And what are the intentions of the Angel camp and the Devil camp? I have to think carefully about them. I don’t dare say that I want to join the third camp because of my lack of ability, but I support the Necromancer.

The Crusader Team led by Junghoon pushed out the Reconstruction Alliance and secured a “Cheongnyangni base.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the Crusaders also broadcast the scenes of defeating them for propaganda purposes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Real time chat]<br/><br/><br/><br/>─ Survive to the end: Yeah, the Crusader Team is amazing but not that impressive.<br/><br/><br/><br/>─ Jinsang JS: I’m not impressed after having watched the Necromancer’s performance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>─ Living in Incheon: Nothing particular.<br/><br/><br/><br/>─ Yeongdeungpo Monk: Good job!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The viewers who watched it did not hide their empty feelings and their reaction in the chat room was lukewarm.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everyone knew the reason. It was because all the players of the Korean server were pretty much influenced by the Necromancer’s performance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, we also have to hunt from now on. Haven’t you heard what the Necromancer said? Otherwise, we’ll be eliminated at the end of the day!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it, Heyon, please calm down first.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After she watched the Necromancer’s broadcast, she made a fuss like a child.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Her father, Muyon, calmed her down and said, “No matter what, you shouldn’t be hasty. You have to prepare slowly and carefully. After all, we have to protect ourselves, so we have to make sure none of us die or get hurt.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay, Dad…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, Muyon also hoped that the players on Kanghwa Island would become strong. He was thinking of leveling up and securing the items to steadily increase their survival skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since they had been already defeated by the pirates, they knew they could not afford to be complacent until they were fully competent enough to confront the pirates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Until now they had been focusing on restoring the basic facilities for their daily lives and monitoring the Chinese servers. That’s what they promised the Necromancer, which required considerable manpower and time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the situation changed because the Necromancer defeated the pirates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now the time has come for us to protect ourselves. We can’t stay as a weak group forever. In other words, we can’t seek the Necromancer every time we run into difficulties. As he said, we need to be more useful to him.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You’re right. We’ve been helped twice by him. Someday we should be able to help him, too.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They have already supported the third camp for a long time and have followed the Necromancer’s intentions. Therefore, they had no choice but to take seriously what Sungwoo emphasized, namely, they needed to strengthen themselves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, we have to be useful to him someday…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were determined to give strong support to the Necromancer by emerging as one of the proud pillars of the third camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, awesome! Great!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just like the name of the pirates suggested, their warehouses were full of all kinds of items.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho took out two green-bladed daggers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Ghostly Dagger<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Class: Hero<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Dagger<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: When you swing a knife, you can fire a ‘Ghost Blade’ that mimics the shape of the blade.

However, he finally obtained a great item, leaving his nasty past behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Finally, I’ve obtained it, too!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a really lucky day for him because he got an item specialized for throwing daggers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was moved to tears before he knew it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, many memories of my hardships are going through my mind like a flash!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, Sungwoo was also picking up useful items and putting them in his backpack, accompanied by the undead army.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If he could have his way, Sungwoo would collect all the items available here, but since most of the items had been stolen by the pirates, Sungwoo wanted to leave behind enough items to help the Taiwanese players recover their ruined areas and establish a solid foundation for living. “But I can’t give up this one.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, there were things that he couldn’t give up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Vault of Oath<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Finance<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Some of the gold earned by the ‘contracted player’ is automatically deposited.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: You can ‘register a contract’ by placing your palm on the safe. The vault owner can set a ‘collection rate’, and the amount of gold earned by the contractor is automatically deposited into the vault.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Collection rate: 50%<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Registered contractors: 119 people<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Current Gold: 67,858,248<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was almost 68 million gold. This time, the pirates left behind a huge legacy of wealth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’ve got too much gold.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jisu has reached the EXP with which she could use “C-class EXP’ by clearing the “survival quest”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though she did not hunt many devil monsters, she obtained lots of EXP because of the huge level difference. She leveled up using her coupons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, there was a change in the rankings of the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[KOR Server Ranking (Page 1)]<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Kangsok Han (LV. 22)<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) kor-157 (LV. 22)<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) DOCTOR-000 (LV. 20)<br/><br/><br/><br/>4) Youngdungpo Inspector (LV. 19)<br/><br/><br/><br/>5) kor-339 (LV. 18)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, Jisu was ranked 5th on the Korean server. And this incident, too, was enough to make the third camp stand out, for the fact that two of the Necromancer’s team were among the top 5 rankers was surely an attractive symbol.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go back.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo said that, Jisu and Hanho approached him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re all set.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Me, too! Great! I’ve got a weapon, too! Hahaha, you don’t need to make me a bone dagger anymore, Sungwoo!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho and Jisu looked somewhat proud and satisfied with their results.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo and his party finished preparing to return to the Korean server, the Taiwanese players approached them and said goodbye.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you very much. Thanks to your help, we have regained freedom.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We won’t forget your help!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They once again expressed their gratitude,<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, Chen stepped forward and said, “Although I’m not yet competent enough, I’ll contact you soon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>On behalf of the Taiwanese players, he expressed his strong ambition.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I promise you that I will not disappoint you then.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s conditions for them to join the third camp was that they needed to develop the power to protect themselves. It was a desire for them to realize as well as their big challenge. So, they felt a lot more attracted to the third camp that revealed their weakness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, let me wait.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded, then opened the portal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘Return Portal’ to the world tree has been opened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer’s team quickly changed the situation of the world, then went back to the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>After Sungwoo returned to the village, he released all the items he had brought from the pirates’ warehouse. The collected items were so many as to fill almost one truck. Each of them was quite a luxury item.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kyongsu and Inho could not help but be in awe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! What the heck is all this? It looks like you’ve returned from overseas trading on a large cargo ship.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You have plundered the pirates!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having heard that, Hanho stepped forward, with a proud expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahahaha! It is too early for you to express admiration for them. Look at this!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He pulled out two daggers from his waist. Kyungsu and Inho stared at the green objects blankly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is that? Razor?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho was upset about their ridiculous reaction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What did you say? A razor!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Or is it a cake cutter? Are you going to celebrate the victory by yourself?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, that’s right.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No kidding! Oh my God!” Hanho fumed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho swung two daggers and explained to them how effective his item was.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Kyongsu and Inho didn’t pay much attention to what he explained. Instead, they were busy classifying the items according to their uses. </div><h2 id="chapter192">Chapter 192</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>“Oh, this crossbow is very good. I can fire three shots in a row with this.”<br/><br/>“This shield also ranks higher than what we use. I needed to strengthen the tanker line, so this is a good item.”<br/><br/>They selected decent items and handed out the items to the village security guards. They could now upgrade the combat power to defend the village.<br/><br/>“If our security guard keeps getting stronger like this, someday we can be stronger than the Crusader Team, right?” Inho asked.<br/><br/>“Well, I think that’s possible when I analyze it,” replied Kyongsu.<br/><br/>Of course, they were greatly elated with the recent victory.<br/><br/>Although some intruders attacked the village while Sungwoo was away, the village players not only defeated them but also captured them alive.<br/><br/>“By the way, how could you capture them instead of expelling them?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not believe that they captured the intruders alive.<br/><br/>“Well…”<br/><br/>Inho began to explain, “In the past, Sungwoo, you told us all we had to do was just believe in the invisible barrier, so we just patrolled around the barrier regularly.”<br/><br/>Inho was in charge of the village’s security operation. He made eight patrol teams of 48 members and had them monitor and patrol around the invisible barrier closely.<br/><br/>“I think it was around 4:13 pm when we noticed the intruders breaking through the invisible barrier.”<br/><br/>“At that moment, one of the team leaders, Kim, made a good judgment,” Kyongsu added.<br/><br/>Inho nodded, then continued, “That’s right. However, given their item level, Kim judged them to be much stronger than us, so he did not engage in fighting them recklessly and reported to me immediately.”<br/><br/>If the battle broke out right after they broke the barrier, they had no choice but to risk several friendly casualties even if they could block the intruders.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the patrol team needed to identify the intruders, but it would not be easy for them to capture the intruders in a fierce fight.<br/><br/>“So, we intentionally drew them into a trap.”<br/><br/>As soon as he received the report, Inho prepared a trap.<br/><br/>“By mobilizing all the security guards, I had them block all the alleys around the invisible barrier with an “electric fence” where the intruders were drilling holes.<br/><br/>The ‘electric fence’ was an item used by the Vampire Lord when he detained people in a plaza at the time of the massacre. This item has been kept by the village players.<br/><br/>Inho said after they blocked the intruders completely, they waited in hiding on the roof until all of the infiltrators snuck in.<br/><br/>“Finally, they came in, and the invisible barrier was automatically restored, blocking their retreat. At that moment I fired the Iron Mace of Lightning in Mt. Paldal at them… Bang!’<br/><br/>And the iron mace directly hit the infiltrators, inflicting heavy damage.<br/><br/>“We could kill half of them. Besides, our snipers and wizards appeared on the rooftop when they finally had no choice but to surrender.”<br/><br/>Inho shrugged because he felt proud of his operation. It was truly amazing that he used the strategy to defeat such a stronger opponent than his men without any casualties.<br/><br/>“Great job! Thank you,” Sungwoo praised him, recognizing his brilliant strategy.<br/><br/>“Well, a soldier who fails to carry out his security duty cannot be forgiven, as you agree.”<br/><br/>“By the way, where are the prisoners?”<br/><br/>Inho pointed to the museum building, “Oh, right now, I’ve detained them in two warehouses inside the museum, but if they intrude often, I think we will have to build a separate prison.”<br/><br/>“Okay. Let me visit them in the evening.”<br/><br/>There was something he wanted to check out first before interrogating the prisoners.<br/><br/>He needed to check the reward of the “faction quest”.<br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/>-Name: The Third camp’s vault (temporary)<br/><br/>-Grade: Basic<br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/>-Consumption: A certain amount of gold<br/><br/>-Effect: Opens the ‘Inventory’, where you can store and share items in a subspace. If you have permission, you can use it anytime, anywhere. When you store one, 100,000 gold is consumed. (Number limit: 10)<br/><br/>* Registered users with permission: 1<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Flag of the Third camp (temporary)<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: faction item<br/><br/>-Effect: When installing a flag, buffs are given to the players of the Third camp within a certain area (1km). (All stats +1) This buff will be strengthened or reduced according to the ‘power of the faction’.<br/><br/>Although Sungwoo had not yet formed the Third camp, it seemed that both rewards were given as a ‘temporary’ grade.<br/><br/>‘But this is also different from a normal skill.’<br/><br/>The current skill focused on massive utilities and buffs. If they belonged to a specific camp or faction, they could receive special benefits they could not obtain as a sole player.<br/><br/>‘Of course, this is far less than the rewards offered by the Absolute Race.”<br/><br/>The Angel camp was generous enough to give those players who attacked Sungwoo the buffs that significantly increased all of their stats. Since it would take so long for Sungwoo’s camp members to catch up with them, it was not easy for them to fight against the Angel camp players.<br/><br/>‘That is why they needed to make a much more robust organization. Instead of relying on the faction buffs, they need to form a strong organization by themselves…’<br/><br/>Of course, Sungwoo had one thing he could rely on. He turned his head and looked at the world tree growing in the square.<br/><br/>-The world tree (2nd stage of growth) is growing. (15%)<br/><br/>He was not sure how much benefit he would receive from the world tree when it fully grew, but it was certain that it would give him a huge advantage over other hostile forces.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Sungwoo sat face to face with the leader of the intruders. He introduced himself as a “team leader” of an organization called “Hunter Company.”<br/><br/>“Hunter Company?”<br/><br/>“Have you never heard of it? Our company is pretty famous these days.”<br/><br/>He was overly talkative as if he was full of confidence and pride.<br/><br/>But Sungwoo had no intention of quietly listening to his gibberish.<br/><br/>“Really? Well, this is going to be the end of your company’s heyday then.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s threat was indeed dreadful because he clearly said he would end the Hunter Company. The guy’s eyes trembled.<br/><br/>“It was for business purposes that we attacked here. I don’t hold any grudge against you. It was my mistake, a fatal mistake.”<br/><br/>“But you want me to forgive you, right? Well, I do hold a grudge against you, so I won’t make such a mistake.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Honestly, no matter how that guy tried to make excuses, he could not justify his action. So, the more he talked, the more shallow his excuses were.<br/><br/>“What I mean is…”<br/><br/>The team leader dropped his head as if he realized once again he was so scared of even making eye contact with the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“Well, I’m only a field commander, so I can’t tell you about this complicated… And you will soon see our negotiator coming here when our boss finds out my team members have been captured alive here. Our company has even this kind of negotiating mechanism.”<br/><br/>Negotiator? The Necromancer scoffed at that expression.<br/><br/>“Mechanism? So, your company is protecting employees? They are only ridiculous incompetents.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Indeed, as he said, a negotiator they dispatched arrived 12 hours later.<br/><br/>Inho’s patrol team captured two people waiting near the invisible barrier.<br/><br/>They were an old man and woman, who were wearing suits unsuitable for this era.<br/><br/>The man wearing a blue tie stepped forward and said, “Necromancer, it is an honor to meet you. My name is KY, the 2nd Negotiation Team Leader of Hunter Company. It seems like we have caused you a big inconvenience. I apologize on behalf of our company.”<br/><br/>As if they thought they were businessmen, they showed shameless kindness.<br/><br/>“Is it the Evolution Society?” Sungwoo asked blatantly.<br/><br/>He guessed the Evolution Society was responsible for this intrusion, so he wanted to put out the feeler directly.<br/><br/>But they said calmly, keeping a poker face, “Pardon? What did you say? We are from the Hunter Company.”<br/><br/>“No, I’m talking about the guys who hired you.”<br/><br/>“Hahaha, Necromancer, shall we talk about it later? I have a lot to tell you.”<br/><br/>But Sungwoo shook his head coldly.<br/><br/>“I don’t have time. While you are trying to buy time like this, your leaders must rack their brains to run away. Right?”<br/><br/>“No, I don’t think so.”<br/><br/>“If they don’t, they are pretty stupid. How can they deal with me?”<br/><br/>KY had no choice but to smile bitterly.<br/><br/>Sungwoo suddenly lifted his index finger and started tapping his temple.<br/><br/>“Let me tell you one thing. I can extract memories from your corpses. So, I’m going to kill you and find out your lair. Let me start in 10 minutes.”<br/><br/>KY’s expression gradually darkened at his calm voice. He knew the Necromancer was serious.<br/><br/>KY opened his dry lips.<br/><br/>“What do you want? We are here to negotiate with you, Necromancer. We’re ready to pay the price for our wrong choice.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo smiled softly and said, “As I said earlier, I can extract your memories. So, I don’t want to talk with you anymore.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“So, if you don’t want me to kill you, you have to do something more valuable than that, right? I mean something more valuable than what’s in your head.”<br/><br/>More valuable?<br/><br/>KY glanced at the Necromancer’s mouth while swallowing.<br/><br/>Sungwoo slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“Find the main stronghold of the Evolution Society and let me know.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo intended to resolve the old headache on the Korean peninsula. </div><h2 id="chapter193">Chapter 193</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>The Hunter Company’s negotiator had no choice but to accept Sungwoo’s offer.<br/><br/>“Sure, I’ll deliver you good news. I know I’m asking for too much, but would you please take care of our prisoners’ safety?”<br/><br/>KY asked Sungwoo a favor, kowtowing to him, but Sungwoo did not give a positive answer.<br/><br/>“You seem to be mistaken, but my bargaining chip is not the lives of your prisoners here, but the whole life of your organization.”<br/><br/>“Oh, I see. Thank you.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo knew that this guy couldn’t say anything right now, but once he returned to the headquarters of his company, he might try to come up with a dirty trick. Sungwoo could not rule out the possibility that he would join hands with the Evolution Society to get their help.<br/><br/>‘They are not stupid.’<br/><br/>However, the Hunter Company was a group with a working system of their own, so they would carefully decide which faction would be more beneficial for them to take sides with.<br/><br/>Taking note of that, Sungwoo returned the negotiator, ready to take some risk. In other words, Sungwoo was placing bait to catch a large fish.<br/><br/>The next day, Sungwoo paid attention to the administrative affairs of the village.<br/><br/>“Um. When I look at it at a glance, the world tree seems to grow 50 cm a day,” Kyongsu said. Sungwoo looked up at the world tree, which had transcendent power.<br/><br/>It was much bigger than before he went to Taiwan. And its power was already having a tremendous effect on the whole area.<br/><br/>“On Mt. Paldalsan, the glowing grasses started to grow, so I dug some of them. Strangely enough, they are called items. Namely, it’s a medicinal herb.”<br/><br/>Kyongsu opened a small box. Inside, there was some blue-colored grass with its roots lightly covered with dirt.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Healing Herb<br/><br/>-Grade: Rare<br/><br/>-Category: Medicinal herb<br/><br/>-Effect: After you eat it, it has the effect of quickly healing your wounds. You can get much better effects by processing the herbs. In addition, regular consumption can lead to an increase in your stamina level.<br/><br/>These special herbs began to grow around the world tree. This was certainly the influence of the world tree.<br/><br/>On the one hand, since the world tree was influenced by Sungwoo, something unusual was sometimes discovered.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Abyss Root<br/><br/>-Grade: Rare<br/><br/>-Category: Herb<br/><br/>-Effect: Attention! It is a herb that has been affected by something wrong. When you eat it, your health is greatly reduced. You can get a much stronger effect by processing it.<br/><br/>“It looks like you have to deal with this type of herb carefully.”<br/><br/>“Does anybody have a job specializing in processing this?”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo asked, Kyongsu opened his mouth, scratching his chin.<br/><br/>“Uh, it can be used as an ingredient for cooking… Oh, one of the players with the cooking job has chosen alchemist as his minor job. He even made a potion once. I think it’s okay to leave this task to him.”<br/><br/>Since Kyongsu categorized production workers separately, provided work facilities and encouraged production activities, they were organized according to their jobs.<br/><br/>Players who leveled up in such an environment have become experts, so they were ready to use new materials immediately.<br/><br/>“How about setting up a separate potion manufacturing room? There is virtually no basis for potions. I think it will be necessary for us to learn the manufacturing method by experimenting.”<br/><br/>“That’s a good idea.”<br/><br/>A potion was an essential item during a battle as well as after a battle. When they used special materials, they could get powerful buffs, too.<br/><br/>However, this was not all about the influence of the world tree.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo! Listen to this.”<br/><br/>Hanho brought his father, Jeongho, and began to explain something.<br/><br/>“Dad, so what you mean is at some point you didn’t need mana and gold anymore when you opened the Safety Zone, right?”<br/><br/>“Yeah, that’s right. I think that phenomenon happened probably after the world tree had been planted. Suddenly, I saw a message saying something like synergy.”<br/><br/>The “Pioneer Camp” skill, which Jeongho used to build the Safety Zone, was given a new ability after it had been affected by the “Shadow of the Godly Tree.”<br/><br/>“So I got a secondary skill called Eyes of the Air. When I sit still and close my eyes, I can see the area near the invisible barrier surrounding the village.”<br/><br/>“Really? Then, it’s like CCTV, right? Sungwoo, isn’t this a great skill?”<br/><br/>“Hey, son, don’t make a fuss over it yet. That’s not the end. If you sit near me and close your eyes together with me, you can also connect to my skills and see what I see.”<br/><br/>Then, Jeongho opened three of his fingers happily.<br/><br/>“I can connect up to 3 people. Do you want to try?”<br/><br/>“Oh, awesome! You got a windfall without doing anything!”<br/><br/>“Windfall? Son, how can you say that to your father? How ugly of you to select such vulgar words?”<br/><br/>Hanho shrugged and said. “Well, it’s better than you playing cards like before. Back then, you spent all the money, ruining our family’s fortune. Now, you can keep sentry.”<br/><br/>“Hanho, don’t you think that the experience I had gained while playing cards paid off?”<br/><br/>Anyway, Jeongho’s additional skill was a great contribution to tightening the security around the village. Of course, it was only when Jeongho was awake could he use his new skill.<br/><br/>There was one more beneficial effect of the world tree.<br/><br/>-‘Abundance of the Godly Tree’ is given to the whole area.<br/><br/>* Item creation success rate increases. (+50%)<br/><br/>* Increases the probability of additional options when making items. (+10%)<br/><br/>* Item production cost is reduced. (+10%)<br/><br/>Buffs were given to all production operations.<br/><br/>The influence of a world tree was tremendous. Even considering that the world tree was still only at the low level of ‘growth stage 2’, it would give great buffs beyond imagination if it grew in the future.<br/><br/>‘If this trend continues, we can widen the gap between us and the other groups.’<br/><br/>Although the village had only 226 people, they were growing into a truly elite group.<br/><br/>When they accepted more players, these people would play a central role.<br/><br/>‘It was regrettable that we broke up with the Youngdungpo group, but someday we could be bigger than the Youngdungpo group.’<br/><br/>Of course, even after Sungwoo formed the third camp, he had no intention of accepting new players because an incompetent majority would be a big headache rather than help.<br/><br/>So, he was thinking of forming a sound and strong group with excellent quality, even though it was small. To keep such qualitative excellence, he needed to have a lot of good items.<br/><br/>“Leader! I found a new store!”<br/><br/>The best way to obtain good items was a shop. In that respect, Taesung was making a great contribution. Taesung and his friends went around the area several times a day, checking the newly formed dungeons, facilities, and objects, and informing the village about them.<br/><br/>“But this time something is weird. I was trying to check what level it was, but it says no access.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s eyes narrowed when he heard that.<br/><br/>“Where is it?”<br/><br/>Taesung seemed to have hit the jackpot this time.<br/><br/>‘If this is an inaccessible store, it must be a secret store.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo had a “secret store coupon,” which he obtained after hunting the Wyvern Alpha Male.<br/><br/>‘It’s high time to spend the money.’<br/><br/>He had a huge amount of money to spend on items.<br/><br/>It was a movie theater near Paldalmun<br/><br/>It was quite old and small for a multiplex, but a red question mark icon was flashing at the entrance of the theater.<br/><br/>‘As expected, this is a secret store.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo stepped into the theater with big strides.<br/><br/>“You wait here.”<br/><br/>“Uh, it’s inaccessible. Can you go in, Captain?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded without a word.<br/><br/>“Wow, our Captain is special!”<br/><br/>-Would you like to use a ‘secret store coupon’? (Y/N)<br/><br/>No one could enter the ‘secret shop’ freely. When they found a duty-free shop at Kimpo Airport, only Sungwoo, who had a coupon, could enter.<br/><br/>In addition, the secret shop system was not completely random, so a few high-end items were presented to the visitor, who then had to decide which one to buy within 10 seconds.<br/><br/>[Player Profile]<br/><br/>-Name: Sungwoo Yu<br/><br/>-Level: 22<br/><br/>-Job: Necromancer, Black Wizard<br/><br/>-Ability: Strength (24+13), Agility (19+11) Stamina (16+9)<br/><br/>-Reserve Gold: 148,155,405<br/><br/>-Trait: Chaos<br/><br/>‘Now I don’t need to give it a pass like last time when I had to because of insufficient gold.’<br/><br/>In addition to the gold he accumulated, he also gained an enormous amount of gold by wiping out the pirates and blocking the waves of the Devil’s Gate. Of course, the 67 million gold he obtained from the pirates’ vault was the largest portion of his gold reserve.<br/><br/>When he entered the theater, a screen lit up.<br/><br/>-Sit down.<br/><br/>Sungwoo sat in the middle of row F.<br/><br/>-A total of 5 carefully selected items will be released in turn. If you are willing to buy, please say “buy”.<br/><br/>* You have 10 seconds to make the decision.<br/><br/>* Items that you once miss cannot be purchased.<br/><br/>The screen advanced to the next message.<br/><br/>-Since you have a lot of gold, the item grade will be upgraded.<br/><br/>‘I came in with 10 times more gold than last time.’<br/><br/>-The first item has been revealed.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Set of 5 panacea<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: consumption<br/><br/>-Effect: When you use it, all ‘abnormal status’ can be canceled.<br/><br/>* Price: 3,000,000 gold<br/><br/>‘This is an item I gave a pass last time.’ </div><h2 id="chapter194">Chapter 194</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>This item was also available in the secret store at Kimpo Airport.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the time, after thinking hard about it, he gave it a pass to save money to buy more expensive items.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-7 seconds left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Purchase!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now that he had a huge amount of gold, he could buy one without any hesitation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The second item has been revealed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Asura’s Robe<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Overcoat<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Agility increases (+2), stamina increases (+3).

Isn’t it too ugly?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Sungwoo could not give up this good item because of that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Purchase! Well, let me give it to Hanho. He can throw more daggers if he wears this.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt that it would be more beneficial to give it to Hanho than not to buy it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The third item has been released.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Universal Key<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: consumption<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Can open all locked locks.

Sungwoo had never seen an object called “lock” until now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He wondered if it appeared in a treasure box.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Can it unlock the area restrictions, too?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Come to think of it, Sungwoo had a “purple chain” that closed access to a certain area with a similar icon, but he didn’t know whether this universal key could solve it, too.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Purchase!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since he didn’t know when he would find this item useful, he thought he had better buy it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The fourth item has been revealed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Goblin Face Armor<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Mask<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: When you wear it, the damage of the ‘sword’ increases in proportion to the ‘Agility’.

(+20%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Price: 12,000,000 gold<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This one …”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Its appearance was a face armor that looked as if only the lower part was separated from the face of a goblin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After checking closely the effect of the item, Sungwoo decided to buy it too.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Looking at the effect, this item is perfect for Jisu!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu’s Agility was high, so when she wore it, she could maximize its effect in terms of her senses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo wanted to buy one item for her because he already purchased one for Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-7 seconds left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Apart from that, Jisu was a player worth investing in. Except for Sungwoo, she was stronger than any other player with her overwhelming strength.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although she could not summon subordinate spirits or use AOE skills to kill a large number of enemies like Sungwoo, she was superior to him in terms of individual power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Purchase!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu has always been playing a bigger role than expected, so Sungwoo believed that if she could get stronger, she could display her skills much better than now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The fifth item has been revealed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And now it was time that the last item appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo once again checked the letters that appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Myth grade?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Among the items available at the secret shop, the most expensive one was the fifth item.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, it was clear that it was a terrific item.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What a terrific item!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: 600kg Bow<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Myth<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Bow<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: An ordinary person can never pull this bow. (Using condition: 100 or more muscle strength)<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the user pulls the bowstring, an arrow is automatically generated, and the “Fall of the Sun” skill is activated at the hit point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>+ Fall of the Sun: Causes a wide range of explosion and flame magic near the target area. You should exercise caution when using it because it can destroy the whole area. (Waiting for reuse: 10 days)<br/><br/><br/><br/>+ Unconfirmed Set Effect: Triggered when holding 600kg Bow<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Price: 15,000,000 gold<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Myth level?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Apart from everything, this was a “myth” grade item. Sungwoo has never seen a myth grade item except “the seeds of the world tree” until now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Given the influence of the seeds of the world tree, Sungwoo was well aware that the meaning of the myth grade was enormous.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘That’s why the terms of use are so strict.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>-8 seconds left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The value of muscle strength required to pull just one arrow was a whopping 100. Even if Sungwoo, wearing all the buffs, such as Lich and Anubis, brought out his maximum strength, the most he could get was only 57.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, it would take a tremendous amount of time and effort for Sungwoo to pull this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Of course, although I can’t use it right away, I have to buy it.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>-3 seconds left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Purchase!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, Sungwoo never bought it on an impulse because he never knew when he could get another chance to buy these items.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Item disclosure has ended.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You will exit after 10 seconds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was the end of his shopping.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He spent a total of 45 million gold. He used a lot of gold to get quality items. Nonetheless, he still had 100 million gold left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It meant that Sungwoo could pick this kind of valuable item twice more. Of course, the key was how to obtain a coupon for the secret shop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘After all, it was unreasonable for me to expect the Shadow King’s item.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>What he felt regrettable was that there were no items related to ‘The Shadow King’s Legacy’. Of course, it was chosen at random, so it was unlikely that he would get this item.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Well, I still have one more item, so let me find a way to get it.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>If the Shadow King’s legacy was completed, he expected a tremendous increase in power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Are you sure you are giving it to me as a gift?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho, who was fidgeting with the two daggers he had obtained a while ago, felt suspicious rather than feeling gratitude for the gift Sungwoo gave him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You aren’t taking it away from me after giving it to me, right? You remember that Japanese sword you gave me, then took it back.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Japanese sword?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo tilted his head, Hanho opened his eyes wide and said, “You gave it to me l then took it back from me on campus. You even threatened me, telling me you would give it back to me if I cut my arm.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, how come you still remember that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I have a good memory. I’m writing down in my diary all the bad things that you have done to me. You remember you threw me into a helicopter, right? Please do not forget. If you forget, I have to explain to you later when I get even with you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, I didn’t throw you! I gave you a helicopter. If you don’t want it, let me give it to uncle Minsok.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Snorting at him, Sungwoo withdrew his hand, but Hanho quickly took it back. His pride wasn’t strong enough for him to give up a legendary grade gift.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no! Got it, Sungwoo! I was kidding.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho finally threw off the “Thief Hood” that he had acquired during his first level up then put on a new item. Then, he showed off fully after taking out the two daggers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahahaha. Four arms behind my back! Great!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo also gave a gift to Jisu. It was a legendary-grade item, ‘Goblin Face Armor’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She looked at him blankly as if she never expected such a gift from him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? Are you giving me a gift, too?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think this item is perfect for you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I see…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu smiled softly after checking the item information. It was a huge option item that she could not easily obtain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you. I can sense the presence of others with this? It looks like I can serve better with this sensor.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I look forward to it, Jisu.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although she said that as a joke, she could serve as a much powerful surveillance sensor with that face armor, in addition to her transcendental senses.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Oh, I got it!” Hanho clapped his hands as if he remembered something. “Because I kept watching the Liberation Guild broadcast.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why? What happened?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If Jisu was like a senor, in reality, Hanho was always gathering new information as a virtual sensor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There was fierce fighting in various places in the north of Seoul, but now it seems that there has emerged a winner.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The “Fight for Control of the Metropolitan Area (1)” event that took place a few days ago was still going on. Several battles were fought, leaving hundreds of victims. Now, the Angel camp was emerging as the winner of the battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“A few hours ago, the Deputy Commander announced it in the broadcast briefly. The broadcast ended a moment ago, but given his words that the end of the fight was near, it seems the Angel camp guys are now advancing to their opponent’s last stronghold in Mt. Pukhan, I think.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they occupied a total of three bases, they would receive tremendous buffs marked by an increase in attack and defense by 30% for seven days.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the expected buffs did not have a big impact from an individual perspective, they would bring about an overwhelming gap in the strength of their forces in large-scale battles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, if they won this battle, they would have an opportunity to completely eradicate the opponent’s camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘That’s why both camps have no choice but to make an all-out effort to defeat each other. I remember hearing at first that the Reconstruction Alliance was winning the battle at first…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The power of the Reconstruction Alliance was stronger than expected. With the so-called ‘Skoll Troops’ as their main force, they pushed the advance team of the Angel camp to the brink of annihilation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘But that was their last push.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to Hanho’s explanation, the tide was turned when the Crusader Team taking side with the Angel camp appeared after that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, I have to admit the Crusader Team’s defense was the best. I guess there were as many as 75 guys armed with full plate armor. They put on shields and all kinds of buffs before aggressively pushing forward. They didn’t budge at all even though arrows rained down on them endlessly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Reconstruction Alliance fighters couldn’t defeat the Crusader Team wearing hard armor and shields despite their overwhelming firepower.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The Youngdungpo Prosecutor stuck a flag on the ground to use an AOE buff, while the priests in the rear continued to heal each of the Crusader Team members fighting the Reconstruction Alliance guys. In my opinion, Junghoon’s troops were well organized.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fighting against the Reconstruction Alliance’s tremendous firepower from the front, the Crusaders rushed through the railroads of Kwangwoon University. Then, they swept away<br/><br/><br/><br/>the Skoll troops immediately, the pride of the Reconstruction Alliance. The scenes of the Crusaders crushing the Skoll troops were broadcast live to 110,000 people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“To be honest, their fight scenes were cool.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The viewers who were not impressed with other fighting scenes could not help but feel thrilled at the Crusaders’ fantastic performance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, the Crusaders have always been strong.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought the world of them. They weren’t on the same battlefield where the Necromancer fought, so their fighting was given more prominence. Nonetheless, the Crusaders, composed of a total of 75 players, had tremendous power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On this occasion, they once again verified their power to the entire Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Sungwoo felt something different after the two camps’ fierce fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘As I expected, the two camps are not my rival.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, the Angel camp and the Demon camp on the Korean server were not powerful enough to be a big threat to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘As long as there are no other variables, I can destroy them. Let me dominate the Korean server while growing the world tree.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly, Sungwoo was setting up a new goal, a clear and bold goal that was markedly different from the previous one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If I keep trying like this, I’ll be able to find out the cause of this phenomenon and the solution to it faster.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As always, it took power to find out the truth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Exactly 14 hours later, the official statement of the Liberation Guild appeared in the community.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[544] Liberation Guild’s official statement about the fight for the control of the metropolitan area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Author: Youngdungpo Prosecutor │ Hit: 45,542<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you are a member of a specific camp, you may have already heard the news through the system, but I would like to inform you that the Angel camp, where our Liberation Guild is the key player, has won the ‘Fight for the Control of the Metropolitan Area (1)’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, we seek peace and harmony, and we do not want to conquer by force.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We want to announce to the demonic camp that if you are willing to give up a meaningless fight, please make a declaration of surrender through an official announcement, then follow the Liberation Guild’s demands.

Aren’t they going to use the momentum to form the coalition of survivor groups?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the end, Junghoon’s Angel camp won. He proved that he could accomplish the mission without relying on the Necromancer’s power. As a result, he would take control of the metropolitan area. In other words, he was one step closer to the creation of the coalition that he had been longing for.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But there were always variables in the system.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I don’t think this is the end of the battle for the control of the metropolitan area.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? Why?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There was a number at the end of the quest’s name.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Sungwoo said, ‘The Fight for the Control of the Metropolitan Area (1)” was the name of the quest.

Today, something shocking happened on Mt. Pukhan, so I turned it on live broadcast like this.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A player with the nickname “Reporter Ahn” turned on a personal broadcast.

Pukhan where the day was breaking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But there was something very strange about Mt. Pukhan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think that’s the second place where the Fight for the Control of the Metropolitan Area was supposed to take place….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wooooooh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Black trees shot up from the center of the mountain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, they are huge!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They quickly spread all over Mt. Pukhan like fungi. They formed a tremendous force by pushing out the trees that had been taking roots on the Korean Peninsula for a long time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Furthermore, the black branches of the trees stretched up like tentacles, intertwined with each other, and began to form a huge roof covering the entire mountain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While constantly wriggling, the huge roof made those watching squeamish as if the whole mountain was alive.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It seems as if the entire Mt. Pukhan has been covered with a huge dome. Isn’t it impossible for sunlight to permeate into it even during the day? It’s a devil’s forest!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That wasn’t the end. </div><h2 id="chapter195">Chapter 195</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">

Suddenly, there is an earthquake…”<br/><br/>The ground shook with vibrations, and the birds soared, while sand exploded from the center of the black forest.

It seems that’s where the boss is located!” said Reporter Ahn.<br/><br/>Huge caves were seen all over the surface of the rock mountain.<br/><br/>There were entrances into the rock mountain.<br/><br/>“34 hours from now, three camps will participate in this quest and compete with us! Which side will win?”<br/><br/>Since he was the most famous camera operator, he proceeded skillfully despite the bizarre phenomenon.<br/><br/>“Don’t you think the winner is the Angel camp with the largest force Crusader Team? Or the Necromancer’s camp that has always been showing overwhelming power?

Please stay tuned. I’ll continue to deliver news from here on Mt. Pukhan.”<br/><br/>As the scenes of Mt. Pukhan being transformed into a dungeon were revealed, people were getting more and more interested in the three-way competition among the three camps.<br/><br/>The community posted a series of posts and comments predicting the outcome of the fight. In addition, the noisy and confusing situation continued as posts calling for the participation of each camp were mixed up with other posts.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Liberation Guild gathered all the allies to strengthen their power.<br/><br/>However, Junghoon thought that it was not enough, so he reinforced items by collecting almost all the funds available. Nonetheless, he couldn’t get rid of his anxiety.<br/><br/>There was only one reason for his anxiety.<br/><br/>“Damn it! After all, do I have no choice but to fight Sungwoo?”<br/><br/>“Well, you would not have avoided it anyway,” said his deputy.<br/><br/>There was a high possibility that the Crusaders would have to fight the Necromancer’s Third camp.<br/><br/>“Our team members are also anxious.”<br/><br/>“Of course they are. I’m nervous, too.”<br/><br/>The Crusader Team, including Junghoon, felt a different pressure from fighting against the Reconstruction Alliance.<br/><br/>The Third Camp was included in the participation list. As far as they knew, the Necromancer would grab the opportunity to participate in the quest by all means.<br/><br/>“But I never think of losing at all. The Demon camp has virtually lost its power, so let’s focus our firepower on the Necromancer and Sungwoo. We can make it.”<br/><br/>“Got it. I’ll think about the best way to confront Sungwoo’s undead army.”<br/><br/>They prepared their best strategy, so much so that their fighting moral knew no limits.<br/><br/>[601] Liberation Guild, it looks like they were determined to fight it out this time.<br/><br/>-Author: LKK │ Hit: 15,562<br/><br/>I’m a player living in Youngdungpo.

I support the Liberation Guild and the Angel camp!<br/><br/>PC room survivor: The Crusader Team and the Necromancer have never fought, so nobody knows the outcomes if they engage in a fight. The Crusaders’ defense and breakthrough power is much stronger than the Necromancer.<br/><br/>Most of those debating in the community focused on the confrontation between the Angel camp and the Necromancer, so the Demon camp was not the subject of their interest.<br/><br/>It’s because the Demon camp lost lots of troops after they were severely defeated.<br/><br/>But the situation got more complicated.<br/><br/>-[LIVE] The ‘Struggle Guild’ in Kangwon Province declares their support for the Demon camp (12,454 watching)<br/><br/>A powerful reinforcement army began to join hands with the Demon camp.<br/><br/>A muscular, middle-aged man with a battle-ax stood in front of the camera.<br/><br/>“We, the 245 members including Master Bumyol of our “Struggle Guild,” declare that we will participate in this competition.”<br/><br/>It was an organization called the ‘Struggle Guild’ that was newly emerging in the Kangwon Province.<br/><br/>They recently unearthed a devil’s stone statue, so they belonged to the Demon camp. After they declared their participation in the “Fight for the Control of the Metropolitan Area (2),” they represented one of the strong forces of the Korean server.<br/><br/>“We will cooperate with the Reconstruction Alliance in Uijongbu area to lead the Demo camp to victory. As players in Kangwon Province know, we are the warriors who survived the hell of Mt. Taebaek.”<br/><br/>They didn’t exaggerate their confidence. The reason they did not appear until now was that the level of the difficulty of the local quest was considerably high.<br/><br/>By hook or by crook, the assassins killed the boss monsters, but the monsters who lost their leader hid in the mountains and formed a new force.<br/><br/>“We have been fighting without a break until now.”<br/><br/>As a result, the ‘Hidden Quest’ unique to Mt. Taebaek was triggered, reinforcing the monsters there.<br/><br/>Like the bandits, the herd of monsters plundered the player’s village, then repeatedly ran away to the mountain. However, the Struggle Guild members couldn’t attempt to crack down on the monsters recklessly because countless players were annihilated after they went into the deep mountain to go after the monsters.<br/><br/>“But finally we have won!”<br/><br/>The group that ended up defeating those hellish monsters was none other than Bumyeol’s “Struggle Guild.” Although their members were not ranked high in the Korean server rankings, each of them boasted an excellent level and combat power.<br/><br/>“But we won’t take a break. We’ll move to the new battlefield and win again.”<br/><br/>With the addition of the Struggle Guild, the Demon camp, widely regarded as the weakest force, was not to be taken lightly, which made the situation more unpredictable.<br/><br/>And there was an event that made this situation even more violent.<br/><br/>[Fight for the Control of the Metropolitan Area (2)-Predicting Winner (Betting)]<br/><br/>* When betting, you will receive a “Bet Token” item.<br/><br/>* The winning camp receives 1% of the ‘total bet amount’ as the prize money.<br/><br/>* Dividends based on the dividend rate are paid when you accurately predict the winner (Excluding 1% of the winning camp’s prize money)<br/><br/>The event where they could predict the winning team among the three camps and bet gold formally began. Simply put, a gambling place was opened for them.<br/><br/>And it started to be called “Dungeon Toto,” causing a tremendous repercussion because they could make lots of money instead of standing as bystanders.<br/><br/>It was good enough to draw even those independent players who had remained passive bystanders until now into the indirect competition.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, among the parties to the betting, there was someone who was attracted to it.<br/><br/>“Give 1% of the bet amount?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/>Take 1% off the total bet? In Sungwoo’s eyes, it only seemed that the system allowed the participants to make money. And that wasn’t the only way to make money.<br/><br/>“Well, if that’s the case, I think I should pretend to be weak.”<br/><br/>If anybody bets on one of the three teams that are predicted to be less likely to win, they can get a windfall if their prediction is correct. If the Third camp wins with the fewest bets, the person who bets on the Third camp will hit the jackpot.<br/><br/>However, Hanho was not persuaded after hearing Sungwoo’s explanation.<br/><br/>“Pardon? Do people think we’re losing? As you know, we have fought everywhere and won.”<br/><br/>As Hanho said, people watched the Necromancer fighting brilliantly beyond their imagination.<br/><br/>So, few could predict openly that the Necromancer will lose.<br/><br/>So much so that few would believe he would lose, no matter how often they heard about it.<br/><br/>“Let me make them anxious.”<br/><br/>But as long as they bet money, it was supposed to change their mindset. People hesitate to bet when rumors spread that even the horse with the best odds of winning in horse racing is in bad condition. Why? Because they fear they might lose money.<br/><br/>That was the power of tabloid papers.<br/><br/>“Let me feign illness, so I can look weak.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo decided to be an underdog. </div><h2 id="chapter197">Chapter 197</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Since the betting game started, each camp’s propaganda war had grown even more intense.<br/><br/>The low dividend of a camp was a numerical indication of the players’ low expectations and support for that camp, which would have a great influence on their choice of the camp in the future.<br/><br/>In other words, this betting game was not just gambling. Closely linked to politics, it was like an “exit survey” ahead of the decision of the next leader.<br/><br/>Therefore, the representatives of each camp appeared on the air and made a passionate appeal like an election speech.<br/><br/>Junghoon, the leader of the Liberation Guild, said, “After winning the latest battle, the Liberation Guild will bring about a perfect victory by attacking the dungeon in Mt. Pukhan. We have become stronger because we have obtained buffs as a reward for the latest victory. And…”<br/><br/>He then paused for a moment to create a sense of tension.<br/><br/>The hidden card he prepared was quite surprising.<br/><br/>“In addition to the legendary items, we will share various rewards with the founding groups of the “Metropolitan Players Coalition”, which I am currently preparing to establish, so we can seek an equal distribution of power.”<br/><br/>He even decided to share the ‘legendary grade items’, the reward for the successful attack of the dungeon. In other words, the Liberation Guild chose to respect the sentiment of the allied players as much as possible.<br/><br/>On the other hand, people paid intense attention to what kind of card the Demon camp, whose support base was weak, would play.<br/><br/>The Demon camp also expressed their strong determination to win. The ‘Chairman’ of the Reconstruction Alliance, who had been hiding his identity far, appeared in person on the air.<br/><br/>-[LIVE] Demon camp’s official broadcast: Direct announcement by the Chairman of the Reconstruction Alliance (45,655 viewers watching)<br/><br/>“Dear viewers, thank you for watching our broadcast. Let me introduce him to you for the first time. Now, this is the Chairman of the Reconstruction Alliance.”<br/><br/>As soon as the emcee announced, a gray-haired old man with a stern expression appeared.<br/><br/>However, the chat window quickly started to become noisy, for someone who any Korean would know for sure appeared.<br/><br/>[Real time chat]<br/><br/>─ Ahn Jung-hyuk 2: ????<br/><br/>─ Gwangmyeong Brown Bear: ?????<br/><br/>─ Shin Mango: Isn’t he Younghwan Lee, the Chairman of Chonsang Group?<br/><br/>─ Y Jinho: That “bulldozer” Younghwan Lee?<br/><br/>─ JJ SONG: Right! Wow, he is still in great shape even when the whole world is collapsing. I hear rumors that he has been in critical condition, but he seems to be healthier. All the rumors about him are fake!<br/><br/>─ Baedal Park: Wow, but I didn’t even think he was the head of the Reconstruction Alliance. I thought he would act differently. His nickname is “Bulldozer”, isn’t it?<br/><br/>The identity of the Chairman of the Reconstruction Alliance was none other than Younghwan Lee, once the Chairman of Korea’s largest company, the Chonsang Group.<br/><br/>He was nicknamed “Bulldozer” because of his aggressive investment and bold business strategy. And he was surprisingly popular because of his guts.<br/><br/>In other words, he was influential enough to appear suddenly at such an important moment.<br/><br/>He opened his wrinkled mouth.<br/><br/>“We will take the initiative to revive the Demon camp based on our victory. And we are not the only force of the Demo camp. I know there are many players of the Demon camp in Busan.”<br/><br/>As if he intended it, he continued to speak somewhat arrogantly.<br/><br/>“We want to interact with them, and we are willing to give them two of the legendary items given as a reward for our successful attack. And…”<br/><br/>He lifted his index finger, which meant numeric number 1.<br/><br/>“I will give one legendary item to an independent player who chooses the Demon camp in the future. It’s simple. You just need to keep your ‘betting certificate’ and visit the Demon camp with it. I’m going to announce the details to the community.”<br/><br/>To put it simply, he presented the legendary grade item as something like a “lottery prize”.<br/><br/>Although it was a dilemma for those players who hadn’t yet decided which camp to choose, Lee’s offer was certainly appealing to them.<br/><br/>[Real time chat]<br/><br/>─ Insok Park: Wow, this is great!

It meant that this event was a matter of life and death to both camps.<br/><br/>If that’s the case, what would the Third camp, the most promising candidate for the championship, present as an enticement?<br/><br/>People waited for the Necromancer’s announcement with considerable anticipation.<br/><br/>They believed he would be able to come up with something surprising even if he didn’t offer any reward.<br/><br/>However, twelve hours before they entered the dungeon, there was some unexpected news in the community.<br/><br/>[622] I’m in Suwon right now, but there is some smoke rising from the main base of the Necromancer.

Of course, some could still bet on this dangerous investment, but there were only a few who would do so.<br/><br/>“All we have to do is wait until the last moment and invest.”<br/><br/>However, the village players and Kanghwa Island players prepared a large amount of gold, waiting for the proper timing.

When you attack your opponent, you will be declared as an ‘automatic death’.<br/><br/>The system didn’t seem to want them to play the game outside of the given rules.<br/><br/>As a result, the two camps of angels and demons gathered at a certain distance and faced each other, as if they were knights of two families who were about to engage in a full-fledged fight.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the Crusader Team, armed with full plate armor, displayed their strength. They were taking a break, after putting their long swords, iron maces, and shields on the weapon rack they prepared in advance.<br/><br/>“Hey, the Demon camp bastards have been staring at us for some time. What shall we do?”<br/><br/>“What? Are they anxious to suck our pricks?”<br/><br/>Opposite the Angel camp troops were the Demon camp forces who were armed with high-quality items. They seemed to be the elite forces of the Demon camp.<br/><br/>Therefore, it was natural that the two sides were waging a war of nerves.<br/><br/>“You know what? They are new guys. They are self-proclaimed warriors who allegedly came from Kangwon Province some time ago.”<br/><br/>“Oh, you mean the Struggle Guild? They are only small fry who have not yet suffered a painful defeat, right?”<br/><br/>“Yeah, I guess so. How dare these bastards who had been stuck in a remote village suddenly appear and swagger before us?

They won’t even smile if we attack them in the heads right away. Lazy and disgusting sons of a bitch!”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the camera operator was in a position to benefit the most from this kind of situation.<br/><br/>“Now, everyone, this is the entrance to Mt. Pukhan. It’s also the main place of the upcoming second battle for the Control of the Metropolitan Area (2).”<br/><br/>In particular, the player with the nickname “Reporter Ahn” was using the two camps’ waiting area for the broadcast, fully utilizing his recently gained reputation.<br/><br/>“We are expecting a fierce competition among them, but we don’t know what will happen in the dungeon, what monsters and events are there. So, we have to wait until the camps enter the dungeon! Hey, assistant! How many minutes are left before they can enter the dungeon?”<br/><br/>Reporter Ahn had four assistants.<br/><br/>“Well, one hour and ten minutes left.”<br/><br/>“One hour and ten minutes!”<br/><br/>“With only one hour and ten minutes to go before they can enter, the Necromancer, who was caught in a controversy regarding an ambush, has not yet appeared here.”<br/><br/>Then, he lowered his voice and began to question the alleged damages the Necromancer had suffered.<br/><br/>“Is it true that the Necromancer suffered irreparable damage as the Hunter Company claimed? Will we see him again?”<br/><br/>But soon he began to speak in a cheerful voice as if to change the atmosphere.<br/><br/>“Anyway, everything starts in just an hour. Before they enter the dungeon, I would like to get some comments from the major players of each camp! First of all, let’s get some comments from the Demon camp that have once suffered a painful defeat.”<br/><br/>At that moment, various broadcasts were on the air, but Reporter Ahn’s broadcast, which was being watched by 60,000 people, was the most popular. That’s why Reporter Ahn could have an interview with the powerful players from both camps.<br/><br/>The players from both sides, the Angel and the Demon camps, seemed very tense and nervous, but they seemed relieved that the Necromancer, the most promising candidate for the championship, hadn’t appeared yet.<br/><br/>Right at that moment, one assistant shouted at Reporter Ahn.<br/><br/>“Reporter Ahn, look in the sky!”<br/><br/>A huge shadow was cast over the two camps’ waiting area. Everyone raised their heads before they knew it. 7<br/><br/>“Oh, my God! What the heck is that?”<br/><br/>“Ah…”<br/><br/>“Damn it.”<br/><br/>The Angel camp and the Demon camp groaned at the same time because their sense of relief and expectation were gone in an instant when they looked up at the sky.<br/><br/>“Necromancer!”<br/><br/>The most promising candidate for victory appeared proudly. </div><h2 id="chapter199">Chapter 199</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">

Could you please give me an interview? Please!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though there was a big controversy over his whereabouts and safety, the Necromancer duly drew the attention of lots of people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wait a moment, Necromancer! Can you…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the Necromancer passed by the reporter without saying anything.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Gosh! Does he think he is a superstar? You know what? The pen is strong in this world, too!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But his camera continued to film Sungwoo and his party.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer faced the Youngdungpo Prosecutor, namely Junghoo, with the Angel camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s been a while.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m here as your enemy like this.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon seemed not to be pleased with Sungwoo’s appearance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like the rumors that spread throughout the community, it would have been a much more advantageous situation if the Necromancer had not participated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know what’s going to happen inside the cave, but as long as we don’t interfere with each other, I don’t think we will attack each other,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was serious. Junghoon had been his ally for a long time. Although they belonged to different camps, Sungwoo did not want to kill Junghoon and his Crusaders.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘But if I am forced to kill him, I will,’ Sungwoo thought, but he earnestly hoped that wouldn’t happen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, those in the Demon camp were upset after watching the Necromancer facing Junghoon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What are they talking about? By the way, sir, it’s not true that the Necromancer was ambushed with big damages,” Bumyol, the leader of the Struggle Guild from Kangwon Province, asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Younghwan Lee, who was sitting in a wooden chair, nodded calmly, with his fingers interlocked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Younghwan said, “I thought so. He used a trick. What a cunning guy! How come he could think of the money in this situation…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Younghwan found out that the Necromancer carried out an adroit operation for the betting profit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If so, why don’t you take that weapon out? Then, I will destroy his head in the dungeon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bumyol was a strong-willed man who was as big as a bear. When Younghawan nodded, the secretary standing behind him brought him a black hard case.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There are only 4 arrows here. So, you have to make sure you shoot them accurately.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Inside the case were four silver arrows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Holy Blood Arrow<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Class: Unknown<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Player Manufacturing Item<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Strong divine power is concentrated in the arrows.

Would you believe we made it by boiling 10 priests alive? If you hit the Necromancer’s heart, it will deal a fatal blow to him. (Manufacturer’s skill)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bumyol accepted the item and said to Younghwan, “Sir, don’t worry. One of my subordinates is an experienced archer. He has never missed. This guy hunted trolls in Mt. Taebaek.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Although you have four arrows, you must aim for the decisive moment to fire the arrow, got it? If you miss the target, the Necromancer will know the power of this weapon. So, remember that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, sir. By the way, where did you get this weapon? I think this is the perfect weapon with which we can kill the Necromancer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Younghwan stared at him silently with no expression on his face, then said, “Well, you don’t have to know about it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahaha! After all, you’ve got lots of secrets. Okay, I’ll respect your secret.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Demon camp bet everything on this battle. It meant that they were determined to kill anybody who stood in their way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, I just can’t understand why the Necromancer has only three including himself in this crucial fight. I think they have a lot of guts.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You should not see the Necromancer as a one-man army. Look at that sword woman over there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, she looks pretty.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A woman stood behind the Necromancer. She was wearing a red sweatshirt, with two swords on her waist. She was now staring into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That woman is fifth in the Korean server rankings. That’s not the level she could reach by simply being around the Necromancer. When a few monsters in Taiwan were slaughtering dozens of tankers, she hunted them all alone.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I saw her fighting, too.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She was a player ranked 5th in the Korean server rankings with the nickname “kor-339”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That woman could be the variable in this fight. When the battle begins, you have to kill her first.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, my subordinates might want to enjoy fighting her for some time, but since you gave me such a reminder, I’ll keep it in mind, sir.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, it was ten minutes to go before the three camps entered the dungeon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Light was shining from the three entrances.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The entrance to the Third camp (temporary) has been marked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The three camps were expected to enter different entrances. So, the leftmost entrance was marked as blue for the Angel camp, the middle was marked as green for the Third camp, and the right one was marked as red for the Demon camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A path opened up between the densely grown trees.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was only darkness so they couldn’t see an inch in front of them, and fog came from everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Angel camp, fall in! Stand by to enter the dungeon! The Crusader Team, you guys enter first!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Angelic camp, whose striking force numbered more than 500, was the first to move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the Demon camp also began to get busy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Close in, mountain warriors!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This mountain range is our battlefield! Compared with the giant Mt. Taebaek, Mt. Pukhan is nothing!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Demon camp seemed to number more than 700, with the Struggle Guild fighters taking the lead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Compared with the two camps, the Third camp led by the Necromancer seemed pretty relaxed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How about entering the dungeon when it’s open?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, I feel like I want to stop by the restroom. I’m getting nervous for no reason.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those who watched the Necromancer’s team began to whisper among themselves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No matter how strong the Necromancer is, don’t you think it’s too absurd that he is fighting the other two camps with only two supporters?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m not sure if you can call the Third camp a camp, compared to us. Given their size, they’re only a party.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They look rather arrogant.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Is it because of the controversy over the Necromancer’s whereabouts in the community?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lots of comments began to be uploaded about reevaluating the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Sungwoo didn’t care about it. The more they underestimated his power, the better it was for him because their betting had been going on until a moment ago.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Winner prediction (bet) ends.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Fight for Control of the Metropolitan Area (2)-Winner Prediction (Bet)]<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Angel camp: 170,001,600 gold (41.6%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Demon camp: 163,300,400 gold (39.9%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Third camp: 95,355,000 gold (18.4%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>= Total: 408,657,000 gold<br/><br/><br/><br/>= Prize money: 4,086,570 gold<br/><br/><br/><br/>* When you bet, you will receive a “Bet Token” item.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* The winning camp receives 1% of the total bet amount’ as the prize money.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Dividends according to the dividend rate are paid when you have the winner prediction right. (Excluding 1% of the winning camp’s prize money). </div><h2 id="chapter200">Chapter 200</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Eventually, the betting rate for the Third camp rose to 18.4%.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, some of them decided to bet after watching the Necromancer appearing on Mt. Pukhan, with no damage at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Lol! If the Necromancer wins. We’re going to get a huge dividend! I guess this is the joy of gambling. It seems like my father’s gambling habits seem to be revived in my DNA!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the last minute, those who supported the Third camp, as well as Sungwoo’s party, made a surprise bet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[My bet status]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Winner prediction: Third camp<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Bet amount: 70,000,000 Gold (73.4%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Estimated Dividend Amount: 296,954,695<br/><br/><br/><br/>*Out of the total amount (404,570,430), excluding 1% of the prize, your bet rate (73.4%) is determined as the dividend.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo invested a whopping 70 million gold, accounting for 73.4% of the total bet on the Third camp. As a result, if the Third camp won, he would have a whopping 300 million gold, in addition to the prize money.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If I win, I can raise operating funds that exceed the other two camps.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, they needed money to run and grow any organization.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Third camp led by Sungwoo was a small number of elite forces, but because of their small size, they found it hard to collect operating funds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If so, how could they get the money?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Well, the easiest way was to just take it out of the pockets of the other camps.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo chose that method.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Enter the ‘Python Cave’ dungeon in the Fight for the Control of the Metropolitan Area (2). (30 seconds remaining)<br/><br/><br/><br/>A game that will provide quality manure for the growth of the Third camp had just begun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have entered the massive dungeon ‘Python Cave’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You cannot exit until you begin the attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo and his party entered the green entrance and passed through the trees, the loose trees tightened and closed the entrance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, the cave was filled with complete darkness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, they turned on the lantern they had prepared in advance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have been trapped.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, we’re in a dungeon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They couldn’t get out of the dungeon unless they went out where there was an exit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Gosh, why are the trees so big?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The light of the lantern was intense, but since it was blocked by a huge tree trunk, it could not shed light far enough. The giant trees were lined on both sides endlessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the plants that had been growing on the mountain before were laid by the roots of the huge trees, pushed out of the place and uprooted.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>* Grab the ‘Giant Jannabi’ with the key and move to the next chapter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jannabi?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck does it mean? Is it a butterfly?” Hanho murmured, tilting his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu immediately replied, “Jannabi probably refers to a monkey.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? Which language is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As far as I know, it’s pure Korean.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If what she said was true, it seemed that a monster similar to a monkey would appear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It will not be easy for us to deal with monkey monsters in this environment.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo lifted the lantern. A huge tree in front of them stretched up to the very top of the dome. Since it had thick branches all around its trunk, it was the best environment for animals that could climb trees well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s look over our heads carefully.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Argh! Ahhhhhhhhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a terrible scream from far away in the woods. It wasn’t just one man’s scream. Painful screams came out in succession.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens were being slaughtered right now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They must be affiliated with other camps.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The three camps entered the dungeon through different entrances then scattered in the forest. They seemed to have encountered something in the woods.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’ve found it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, they confirmed the existence of “Giant Jannabi” earlier than the other camps.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s a monkey! Monkey!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a huge monkey. The beast with long arms covered in black hair was hanging from the tree, blinking his red eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr…<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fire the arrows!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ping! Ping!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the arrows couldn’t hit the monkey at all. The monkey climbed the tree at a tremendous speed. Not only was the tree tall, but it was so dark that they could not see the money well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, they could not cut or burn this giant tree because it seemed to be protected by some magical power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! How can we hunt that monkey?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Demon camp forces kept running around, raising their heads to search for the monkey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, there was one thing they were mistaken about.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This wasn’t just a chase game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wooduuuuuuuuuk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While they were chasing the Giant Jannabi, screams began to come out from those in the rear. “What the heck? What’s going on in the back?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a long arm came down from the tree and grabbed an archer’s neck. He was immediately pulled up into the air. Since he was pulled up instantly, he could not respond at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wooduk! Wooduk!<br/><br/><br/><br/>His screaming resonated throughout the darkness. When Sungwoo shone the flashlight on the tree, four Giant Jannabi were tearing the archer’s limbs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! They are moving super fast! Everyone, watch over your head!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are aiming for you from above!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The three-meter-tall monkey, Giant Jannabi, was a definite predator. They were preying on the innocent players who entered the forest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Angel camp soldiers were faced with the same situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They kept firing the iron maces in succession, but they could not shoot down the monkeys.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since they were well organized, they could avoid the fate of being pulled up the tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Those bastards are waiting for us to be scattered. So, if we show any loophole, they are going to come down and drag us up straight away.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Deputy Commander Minhum checked their movement and analyzed their attacking pattern coldly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Junghoon opined differently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If that’s the case, we have no other choice but to disperse to lure them to the ground, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even at the sacrifice of his team members, he had to attack the monkeys quickly because his camp was competing with the other two camps.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s dangerous, but it seems worth trying. But, the thing is how to drop them from the tree after luring them…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, Junghoon knew how to take the risk of making them crawl down the tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But dropping those monsters from the tree would be very tough.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were incredibly fast and ridiculously resilient. The trees around were high with indefinite branches. The moment they felt threatened, they would climb up the tree instantly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Not all of them have the key. That means we have to hunt lots of them. If they notice our intentions, they might not come down easily.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was clear the monkeys had some intelligence, so if Junghoon had to turn to a decoy operation, the fight would drag on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While agonizing over the best way, Minhum let out a sigh before he knew it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was afraid that if he didn’t come up with any solution quickly, the other camps might get ahead of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it. I just wonder how Sungwoo is coping with this situation.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was referring to the Necromancer. What kind of method will he resort to?<br/><br/><br/><br/>A message that came up a few minutes later frustrated them a lot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘Third camp (temporary)’ has obtained the key.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon and Minhum sighed at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer, who was treated as an underdog for some time, seemed to be taking the lead like before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If he keeps getting ahead of us…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Third camp was ahead of them to claim the huge sum of 300 million gold and five legendary items.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Deep in the mountains, far away there was some dense smoke along with the sound of dripping water. It was the sign of the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A multitude of beings began to pass by overhead. They were moving among the trees.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusader Team members shone the light on them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What was reflected in the light was something white.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were the skeletons of the Giant Jannabi.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the moment when the strategy only available to the Necromancer came to light.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The easiest way to overcome a difficult environment was to adapt to it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer could make the beings living in that environment his subordinate spirits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In short, the Necromancer was an all-weather player. </div><h2 id="chapter201">Chapter 201</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>The Third camp passed the first test, although other camps were at a loss, not knowing how to attack the monkeys. How did the Necromancer hunt the monkeys?<br/><br/>Bumyeol, the vanguard of the Demon camp, gnashed his teeth after looking at the message.<br/><br/>“Necromancer…”<br/><br/>He prepared a special item to kill him, but if he wasn’t on the same battlefield as the Necromancer, he wouldn’t have a chance to use the item.<br/><br/>In the worst situation, he might have to chase them without firing the arrows while attacking the dungeon.<br/><br/>“What kind of method did the Necromancer use?”<br/><br/>They had no way of knowing it.<br/><br/>About 20 minutes prior, it was Jisu who offered the clue about the attack.<br/><br/>She put on the item “Goblin Face Armor” she had received from Sungwoo. When she wore the mask with the goblin’s teeth exposed, only her insensitive eyes were exposed, creating a terrible atmosphere.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>She closed her eyes and developed her extended senses.<br/><br/>-In proportion to your agility level, the damage of the ‘sword’ increases. (+44%)<br/><br/>-Through the ‘Goblin’s senses’, you can detect objects around you more clearly.<br/><br/>Even without such a mask, she had supernatural senses, so she could feel all the movements in her area.<br/><br/>When she was given the buffs by wearing the goblin’s face armor, she could detect what was going on nearby without light.<br/><br/>“I can hear them…” she said.<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“The sound of something bumping. It’s a key. Giant furry beasts on a tree… One of them has the key.”<br/><br/>That showed how sharply she could sense and detect what was around her.<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party trusted her and pondered over the best way to hunt the monkeys based on the information she provided.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, how can we lure them down the trees? They are swinging back and forth above our heads, but they aren’t coming down.”<br/><br/>They also seemed to be aiming for Sungwoo’s party, but they only followed at a certain distance as if to check their opponent’s capabilities.<br/><br/>“Should we climb the trees?” Hanho asked.<br/><br/>Of course, they could not. Among the subordinate spirits under Sungwoo’s control, ‘Ghoul’ or the ‘Zombie Birds’ could attack them on the tall trees, but they could not get the monkeys to come down.<br/><br/>‘Giant Jannabi’ were large monsters, and dozens of them were flocking around in a group.<br/><br/>So, if they recklessly tried to climb the trees, they would be annihilated before they could attack them.<br/><br/>“We have to make them come down.”<br/><br/>“How?”<br/><br/>“They think the treetops are the safest place for them, so we have to change their thinking.”<br/><br/>“I know, but how?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo used the skill without replying to him.<br/><br/>– Caution! A ‘poisonous cloud’ will be created in the target area.<br/><br/>But he could not confirm the effect of his skill even though mana was consumed.<br/><br/>That was understandable, given that the raindrops could not be seen because the enormous trees intertwined with each other formed a dense roof, blocking the light.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, what did you do a moment ago?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo waited patiently.<br/><br/>Tuk- Tuk-<br/><br/>Standing in a dense forest, they could avoid the splattering raindrops because raindrops fell on numerous leaves rather than falling on the ground. Then, what about the top of the trees?<br/><br/>The answer was they could get wet enough from the raindrops.<br/><br/>As expected, shortly afterward, the monkeys’ disgusted shouts came out.<br/><br/>The Giant Jannabi near the top of the trees were exposed to the poisonous clouds little by little.<br/><br/>“Uh, they’re coming down!”<br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh! Kuuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/>They began to descend to a slightly lower position, screaming in embarrassment.<br/><br/>The ghouls Sungwoo had summoned in advance began to move.<br/><br/>While hiding behind the wooden pillars, the ghouls climbed up the trees in no time and struck down the Giant Jannabi.<br/><br/>Thud-<br/><br/>They got tangled with each other before falling. They were large and strong, but when three ghouls charged at them at the same time, they had no choice but to fall from the trees.<br/><br/>Wooduuuuuuuuuuk!<br/><br/>However, as they were 3 meters tall and heavy, their grip was very powerful.<br/><br/>They easily threw off the two ghouls stuck on their arms then plucked the heads of the ghouls from their bodies.<br/><br/>It seemed that the ghouls alone could not confront them, but Sungwoo already prepared another option to deal with such a situation.<br/><br/>Green eyes emerged from the dark.<br/><br/>Then, two black chains came out suddenly and wrapped around their necks and shoulders.<br/><br/>He was Minsok, the Death Knight. He used the “Abyss Chain” skill to bind the Giant Jannabi.<br/><br/>Kaaaaaah!<br/><br/>Minsok was dragged a couple of steps when one of them strained his body, but Minsok started pulling it backward with a chain on his wrist. The ghouls’ grip was nothing compared to Minsok’s pull.<br/><br/>“Hey! You can’t beat me!”<br/><br/>At the next moment, Jisu appeared in front of the Giant Jannabi and cut its neck before stepping back. Then, Sungwoo lifted his repeating crossbow at the monkey who couldn’t escape at all.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>The monkey suffered severe damages before collapsing.<br/><br/>-You have earned 135,440 gold by hunting ‘Giant Jannabi’.<br/><br/>“Wow, one down!”<br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>There was a series of loud screaming over their heads as if to shake the whole forest.<br/><br/>Other monkeys who witnessed the death of their fellows began to scream and threaten them.<br/><br/>Since they belonged to the primate species, it seemed they had a strong kindred for each other.<br/><br/>Ooh! Ooh! Oooh! Ooooh!<br/><br/>“Ugh, it’s so noisy.”<br/><br/>They got excited and started to jump around the trees, but they didn’t dare to come down.<br/><br/>“I don’t think they want to come down yet.”<br/><br/>“Well, when they get exposed to the poisonous clouds once again, they will have to. So, everybody, take a deep breath.”<br/><br/>“Pardon? Deep breath?”<br/><br/>Something flew through the trees. They were “zombie birds.” They grabbed the corpses of ghouls and Giant Jannabi and climbed up.<br/><br/>The zombie birds flew near the tops of the six trees where about ten Giant Jannabi were hanging. The monkeys were gazing at their fellows’ corpses the zombie birds were carrying toward them.<br/><br/>Something that they couldn’t imagine happened.<br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>Flames rose amid the explosions of the corpses, but they could not make the monkeys come down.<br/><br/>What Sungwoo aimed at was the next attack.<br/><br/>Poooooooooh-<br/><br/>He let out the ‘Abyssal Breath’, which was an additional effect of the ‘Corpse Explosion’ skill after he had upgraded it.<br/><br/>Compared to the original Abyss Breath, it was rather weak but alone it was powerful enough to disrupt the monsters’ bodily functions.<br/><br/>Keeeeeeeeeeeh! Keeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/>The monkeys who breathed in the Abyssal Breath got frightened and began to come down to the lower trunks of the trees. Some of them lost their balance, rolling down the trees.<br/><br/>Khhhhhhhheck!<br/><br/>The undead hiding around them charged at them instantly.<br/><br/>In other words, they entered the realm of the Necromancer’s team.<br/><br/>-You have earned 170,000 gold by hunting ‘Giant Jannabi’.<br/><br/>-They have become your subordinate spirits.<br/><br/>Sungwoo could obtain a large number of Giant Jannabi skeletons.<br/><br/>By using them, Sungwoo took down the monkeys on the tall trees and started hunting, and soon, he caught the Giant Jannabi who was holding the key.<br/><br/>This was the Necromancer’s unique, all-weather strategy.<br/><br/>“Phew! We’ve finally found it.”<br/><br/>-The ‘Third camp (temporary)’ has obtained the key.<br/><br/>Then, the bronze key on the neck of the monkey glowed green. It floated by itself into the air and flew away!<br/><br/>“It seems the key is leading us to the next area, right?”<br/><br/>The Third camp was ahead of the other two camps now.<br/><br/>In the meantime, about a hundred people were waiting near the entrance of the dungeon.<br/><br/>Most of them were affiliated with the angel or demon camp, so they were guarding the entrance in case of an unexpected situation.<br/><br/>With a strange and tense atmosphere, some people had been talking since the others entered the dungeon.<br/><br/>“Hi folks, although it’s quiet here right now, I guess they are now fighting severely inside the dark forest. Pardon? Well, the reason I keep broadcasting despite nothing special happening is that we want to bring you the news as soon as possible. I would appreciate it if you keep watching this broadcast!”<br/><br/>They were camera operators doing their broadcasts, including Reporter Ahn.<br/><br/>Since all the camps decided not to have the cameramen film their attack for fear of exposure to the other party, they had no choice but to wait outside the dungeon.<br/><br/>The only information they could get was from the status messages written above the entrance of each camp. However, since it took time for them to attack successfully, the broadcast was getting boring, and the viewers began to complain one by one.<br/><br/>One of the cameramen shouted.<br/><br/>“Look at that! Reporter! Look!” </div><h2 id="chapter202">Chapter 202</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>The camera turned at the same time as the assistant yelled.<br/><br/>A stunning moment broke their boredom in an instant.<br/><br/>The reporter, swallowing, announced the new development in an urgent tone.<br/><br/>“He’s intact! He’s still the same Necromancer we know!”<br/><br/>[Real time chat]<br/><br/>─ KWW: Oh, no, please!<br/><br/>─ 28-year-old Jinhyung: Please, I bet 100,000 gold. Necromancer, please, don’t!<br/><br/>─ Kim Jammin: Damn, you guys wished the Necromancer died, right? Why are you making such a big fuss?<br/><br/>─ Yasuo 1: What are the Demon camp up to now? Are they just numerically superior? Aren’t they called the warriors of Mt. Taebaek? How can they be so defeated by three monkeys?<br/><br/>─ Goblin Hunter 123: Lol. Yeah, the Necromancer is always right!<br/><br/>─ Uncle Yun: Honestly, isn’t this what we all have expected? I think you guys got blinded by something wrong, but look! The Necromancer was only weak in your delusions!<br/><br/>The money of Korean server’s gamblers was rolling into the pockets of the Necromancer.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party, escorted by the key, soon arrived at the second place. Thick vines were draped across the road like curtains, so they could not get into it, but when the key touched it, the road began to open to them.<br/><br/>Ooooooooooh-<br/><br/>Blue light poured into it. Sungwoo and his party squeezed through the cracks of the vines and escaped to the other side.<br/><br/>“Oh, it’s bright here.”<br/><br/>They were still inside a forest with the sky blocked by the trees, but they didn’t need to walk in the dark because bright light was flowing from all over.<br/><br/>“Moss?”<br/><br/>Minsok lifted his feet and looked down at the green moss emitting a blue glow.<br/><br/>“The moss is radiating light.”<br/><br/>As he said, moss clinging all over the forest was emitting blue light.<br/><br/>* The next chapter is an area covered with ‘poison fog’. Hunt 100 ‘Venom Giant Wasps’ in the area to obtain ‘Venom Immune Buffs’ before moving to the next chapter.<br/><br/>Weeeeeeeeeeing―<br/><br/>There was the sound of flapping wings. When they raised their heads, a wasp almost the size of a forearm flew through the trees. The stinger on its tail looked like a stake.<br/><br/>“Man, I thought it was a drone.”<br/><br/>“Because the wasp is so big, it’s unrealistic.”<br/><br/>Jisu found something different while Hanho and Minsook were uttering admiration.<br/><br/>She raised her sword and pointed somewhere.<br/><br/>“There is a very noisy place. It is a hive where dozens of wasps are gathered.”<br/><br/>When they approached the place she pointed at, something was hanging from a thick branch at the top of the giant tree. It looked like a hut on top of a tree.<br/><br/>“It’s a honeycomb.”<br/><br/>There were dozens of poisonous giant wasps sticking around the hive that was about five meters wide.<br/><br/>Weeeeeeng-<br/><br/>The wasp was flying around it, which looked like a helicopter flying near a building.<br/><br/>“Touching it is crazy, isn’t it?”<br/><br/>Hanho muttered, hiding behind the tree before he knew it.<br/><br/>In his mind, Sungwoo would have destroyed it entirely.<br/><br/>What if he destroyed that terrible hive. It was not an ordinary wasp nest.<br/><br/>Hanho didn’t want to imagine what would happen if he touched something terrible like that.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, please…”<br/><br/>‘By the way, no matter how hard I think, it is inefficient to catch them one by one until we reach 100.’<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo stepped forward and opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“Everyone, step back!”<br/><br/>As Hanho expected, Sungwoo was going to destroy the huge hive at once.<br/><br/>‘Let me just burn it away.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo raised the repeating crossbow. Since it was equipped with the function of ignition, he could burn the wasp hive.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>However, the arrows he fired could not even reach the wasp’s nest and fell away.<br/><br/>It looked like the hive was covered with a protective film, blocking the outsider’s attack.<br/><br/>“If that’s the case…”<br/><br/>A little later twelve Giant Jannabi skeletons began to climb the tree.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>On their backs were axes and rakes made of bones.<br/><br/>Immediately after the five of them at the forefront reached the branch with the wasp hive, they drew their axes.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>Then, they began to crush the branches ruthlessly. An ordinary man couldn’t cut them easily because they were thicker than the trunk of a pine tree, but the skeletons could easily cut them down with their immense strength.<br/><br/>Weeeeeeng!<br/><br/>The wasps sensed danger then quickly flew up and turned towards the skeletons.<br/><br/>Then, they began to fire huge stingers at the skeletons.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>The huge stingers stuck the skeletons, making a loud sound.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>However, the skeletons continued to throw the axes casually. Come to think of it, the wasps’ poison stingers did not affect their bones.<br/><br/>Tong! Tong! Tong!<br/><br/>Normally, the wasps’ poison stingers would be fatal attacks, but they were no more than ordinary attacks as long as the poison didn’t work.<br/><br/>‘Drop them!’<br/><br/>Sungwoo already prepared some methods to counter the wasps’ counterattack.<br/><br/>The undead standing behind the skeletons pulled out the rakes made of bones.<br/><br/>Using the long and wide striking range of the rakes, they began to tear off the wasps’ wings.<br/><br/>Wooooooooooooh-<br/><br/>The wasps that lost their flight ability helplessly fell and were killed by the undead waiting on the ground.<br/><br/>-You have earned 25,000 gold by hunting the ‘poisonous giant wasp’.<br/><br/>-You have earned 25,000 gold by hunting the ‘poisonous giant wasp’.<br/><br/>-Hunting a poisonous giant wasp (4/100)<br/><br/>Cracks began to spread in the thick branches.<br/><br/>The giant wasp nest, which was hanging at the end, collapsed.<br/><br/>The huge object shattered like a watermelon and Sungwoo aimed the repeating crossbow straight at it.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>There was no protective shield around it now. A barrage of powerful arrows smashed the wasp’s nest to pieces.<br/><br/>That wasn’t all. Sparks arose from the place where the arrows hit and merged into a huge flame.<br/><br/>-You have earned 5,000 gold by hunting the ‘poisonous giant wasp larva’.<br/><br/>-You have earned 5,000 gold by hunting the ‘poisonous giant wasp larva’.<br/><br/>-You have earned 25,000 gold by hunting the ‘poisonous giant wasp’.<br/><br/>-You have gained 200,000 gold by destroying the ‘poisonous giant wasp’.<br/><br/>-Hunting a poisonous giant wasp (34/100)<br/><br/>The whole wasp hive was burned down.<br/><br/>“Wow, we can hunt 100 wasps easily!”<br/><br/>Hanho, hiding behind the roots of a tree and watching it, exclaimed in admiration.<br/><br/>Sungwoo shook his head and said, “No, I’m going to hunt more than 100.”<br/><br/>“Really? Why?”<br/><br/>“Think carefully.”<br/><br/>“Gosh, I have no idea!”<br/><br/>They just had to hunt 100 wasps. Why did Sungwoo bother to hunt more?<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>“We have it finally!”<br/><br/>“Yeah, we got the key!”<br/><br/>“Everyone, move this way!”<br/><br/>As a result, they suffered great sacrifices, but they took such sacrifices for granted.<br/><br/>“Uh, I see the light.”<br/><br/>“Everyone, go in there!”<br/><br/>They came across a mysterious place, filled with blue light.<br/><br/>“Catch wasps?”<br/><br/>“Now, we have to catch wasps after monkeys?”<br/><br/>“But I’m glad we’re not looking for something hidden.”<br/><br/>This time again, the Demon camp troops began to scatter widely and search for targets.<br/><br/>But as time passed by, they felt something strange.<br/><br/>“2nd Team! Did you find a wasp?”<br/><br/>“Nope, we can’t!”<br/><br/>“What about the 3rd Team?”<br/><br/>“No, we can’t either!”<br/><br/>All the teams reported they had not seen any wasps yet.<br/><br/>Bumbyol nervously swung his fist toward the trees.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>“Damn, where the hell are the wasps?”<br/><br/>No matter how thoroughly they searched, they couldn’t find even one live wasp.<br/><br/>They found it hard to search for the monkey with the key, but this time they found almost no wasps to hunt.<br/><br/>Shortly afterward, they came to know the reason.<br/><br/>“No way! Is that the wasp’s nest?”<br/><br/>They began to discover huge wasp nests in the forest that had been turned into lumps of charcoal after being burnt.<br/><br/>“The Necromancer destroyed them all?”<br/><br/>“That bastard…”<br/><br/>The most basic way to get ahead was to go faster than others, but the more certain way was to kick down the ladder, so they could not follow. </div><h2 id="chapter203">Chapter 203</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>-The ‘Poison Immunity’ buffs are being applied.<br/><br/>* This effect disappears when you exit the dungeon.<br/><br/>* Kill the boss monster ‘1st Python’<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party went into the cave filled with poisonous fog. It seemed they entered what looked like a stone mountain that stood in the center of the huge trees.<br/><br/>Wooooooooong-<br/><br/>An unpleasant wind was blowing from inside of the cave, and all kinds of hieroglyphs were engraved on the wall inside the cave. Some of them shone purple, which made them feel eerie as if they had stepped into an ancient temple.<br/><br/>Sungwoo carefully looked at the mural because he thought the hieroglyphs were not there simply as decorations.<br/><br/>However, only pictures of a large snake inside a huge pit appeared one after another, and Sungwoo could not figure out what they were.<br/><br/>“Man, it looks like we are in the boss monster’s room right now,” said Hanho.<br/><br/>Only the sound of water dropping rang after he said that.<br/><br/>They kept walking for a while in silence.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at Jisu, who had been staring at the inside of the cave with a frown from the moment she entered the cave.<br/><br/>She then shook her head and said, “I can’t feel anything either. It’s like we are blocked by something like a transparent plate.”<br/><br/>“I see.”<br/><br/>If she couldn’t feel anything with her senses, there was nothing here or monsters that could hide in the dark, which was more likely, Sungwoo thought.<br/><br/>The bigger problem was that he had never met monsters that could hide until now.<br/><br/>He had no choice but to feel wary.<br/><br/>“Given the size of this dungeon. I think the monsters here must be very unusual and big. So, we need to be very careful,” said Sungwoo. He was also on alert.<br/><br/>Imoogi, or python, was described as the boss monster of this dungeon. It was a mythical creature going through the process of becoming a dragon.<br/><br/>In other words, this creature could be completely different from the monsters he had encountered so far.<br/><br/>They became warier and warier when they stepped further into the cave. Although they couldn’t explain what it was, they felt like something sticky was getting stuck to their whole bodies and pressing them.<br/><br/>“Eww… the more I go, the more stuffy it gets. It feels like I’m in hot water.”<br/><br/>“Me, too…”<br/><br/>Hanho’s expression fit where they were now. It seemed to be similar to a decline in their stats, but Hanho and Jisu seemed to feel it more violently than Sungwoo who had divine status.<br/><br/>But they could not stop moving.<br/><br/>“Let’s keep going anyway.”<br/><br/>Even though Sungwoo took action to stop the other two camps from following them, he was not sure when they would catch up.<br/><br/>Anyway, they kept walking through the long entrance of the cave, finally encountering a wide space.<br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/>In other words, they stepped into a great darkness.<br/><br/>The space was so vast they could not light the whole place with only a few lanterns. The light was eclipsed by the darkness and lost its power.<br/><br/>The high dark ceiling and the steep cliff seemed to devour Sungwoo and his party like a giant monster.<br/><br/>“Uh, uh…”<br/><br/>Stunned by that terrible sight, Hanho groaned, which resonated through the vast space.<br/><br/>They had no choice but to stop there because they realized that this wasn’t a space they could cross recklessly.<br/><br/>Splash! Splash!<br/><br/>It was the sound of dripping water.<br/><br/>The small sound couldn’t escape from being heard in this enormous space, hitting and bouncing, cracking and crushing against the walls and ceilings here and there before scattering into hundreds and thousands of strands of sounds and disappearing eerily.<br/><br/>Woo-uh-uh-woo-woong-<br/><br/>They could not identify the sound with human ears until it was gone. This was a place where sound was born and died at the same time.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, look at that over there…”<br/><br/>“I can see it too.”<br/><br/>From the bottom of the cliff in the darkness, two huge lights slowly rose.<br/><br/>-The boss monster ‘1st Python’ has appeared.<br/><br/>Even before Sungwoo properly confirmed its shape, a message announced its appearance.<br/><br/>They slowly stepped back.<br/><br/>“Uh, that snake is…”<br/><br/>“Be quiet!”<br/><br/>The serpent was overwhelmingly large. Its head was almost 5 meters in diameter. They felt like the headlights of a large truck were slowly approaching in a tunnel where the lights were off.<br/><br/>At that moment, the giant snake slowly opened his mouth. Its hard scales contracted and relaxed, making a fine sound of friction.<br/><br/>Sungwoo made a bone shield in preparation for its attack.<br/><br/>“Welcome, masters of this land!”<br/><br/>They never thought the snake would say hello by opening its mouth.<br/><br/>“Oh, you are good at speaking,” Sungwoo responded.<br/><br/>The serpent spoke accurately enough to make itself understood.<br/><br/>“Is that all you’re curious about when you have come as far as here?”<br/><br/>How could this monster communicate with humans? Sungwoo had seen some monsters like Kobold spitting out unintelligible words, which were closer to screaming than human language.<br/><br/>However, this monster was distinctly different. It did not attack them like a vicious beast but rather seemed to seek rational dialogue with the players.<br/><br/>The serpent even said something pedantic like this, “If there is no language, there is no world. There are only two concepts in this world, namely those just screaming and those like me. But I am fully aware of everything as part of this world.”<br/><br/>Even these pedantic lines were recited.<br/><br/>‘Isn’t this monster trying to deceive me with this intelligent speech?”<br/><br/>But Sungwoo realized that the serpent could respond to what he was trying to say.<br/><br/>“So, are you the only ones here? I heard more around you, but they must be wandering around.”<br/><br/>“Are you going to fight us?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/>When he suddenly asked that, the serpent shook its head slightly as if to express doubts.<br/><br/>“Did you not come here to kill me from the beginning? Why are you talking as if I picked a fight with you?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t refute it because it was right.<br/><br/>“Now that you are silent, you seem to admit what I said was right. Then, take responsibility for your lack of prudence.”<br/><br/>The serpent pulled its head back and disappeared into the darkness.<br/><br/>It was most likely that there would ensue a fight.<br/><br/>“The serpent will attack us, so get ready.”<br/><br/>They held their bone shields one by one and lowered their posture. Since it was dark, they didn’t know where and how the serpent would attack.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned ten troll skeletons to use them as shields.<br/><br/>There was a huge pit in the middle of the space with a flat corridor around its edges, so there was enough space for them to move around for the fight.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Holding his breath, Sungwoo waited for its attack. Since he didn’t know how the serpent would attack, he just needed to look at its movement.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Goblin Fire’ has been summoned in the area.<br/><br/>At that moment, four blue fireworks arose in the air in front of them. Layers of darkness retreated, revealing the silhouette of the giant serpent hiding behind it.<br/><br/>It was staring at Sungwoo and his party. In other words, it was aiming for their lives.<br/><br/>“Run!”<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>They immediately threw themselves to the side.<br/><br/>A blue flame spun near its head and flew in a non-linear trajectory like a missile.<br/><br/>Then, the flame penetrated the troll skeletons standing before them as a shield.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The ten troll skeletons fell like bowling pins, burned in the flames and crushed.<br/><br/>That wasn’t all. The four blue flames turned and returned, sweeping through the collapsing bones once again.<br/><br/>“Damn it…”<br/><br/>As soon as he raised his body, Sungwoo summoned the “Grim Reaper” he cherished and summoned the power of Lich.<br/><br/>-You have summoned the Scythe of Death ‘Grim Reaper’.<br/><br/>-Grim Reaper retention time (00:59:58)<br/><br/>-You have gained the power of Lich.<br/><br/>* You have increased your subordinate spirits by 50.<br/><br/>* You have increased stats by 10.<br/><br/>* You can revive and regenerate nearby undead ‘indefinitely as many as the maximum number of your subordinate spirits’.<br/><br/>“Man, this guy has evil power,” the serpent said, staring at Sungwoo who grew tinged with green flames.<br/><br/>Sungwoo then summoned the power of Anubis.<br/><br/>-You have temporarily gained the power of the death god ‘Anubis’.<br/><br/>-You have temporarily obtained the status of Demigod.<br/><br/>-All stats are greatly increased. (+10)<br/><br/>-You can use  skill.<br/><br/>-You can use  skill.<br/><br/>-You can use  skill.<br/><br/>Noticing Sungwoo’s powerful skills, the serpent continued, “In addition to wickedness, you are full of savageness.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo has now turned into a black wolf.<br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ has begun in this area.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Response of Death’ has begun in this area.<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned all his might at once. Sungwoo moved his body in the black smoke and fired his repeating crossbow.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>Behind him, the troll skeletons raised their bodies and fired the slingshots, while human beast skeletons threw javelins. That wasn’t all. Two “Rock Golems” popped out of the wall, even throwing huge rocks at the giant serpent.<br/><br/>So, dozens of projectiles were fired at him all at once.<br/><br/>But all of them were blocked without any exception.<br/><br/>“What the heck?” </div><h2 id="chapter204">Chapter 204</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>A blue pattern was shining on the forehead of the serpent, stopping all the projectiles from flying toward its head in the air.<br/><br/>“Is this the only thing you can do?” The serpent scoffed at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Then, all the projectiles flew back toward Sungwoo and his forces.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>Sungwoo discovered a shadow created by the goblin flame in a moment and teleported into that shadow.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo’s undead troops were shattered by the returning storms.<br/><br/>Of course, they could resurrect, but they would be useless if their attack was futile.<br/><br/>At that moment, two Bone Wyverns descended from the ceiling and lifted their claws.<br/><br/>Sungwoo wanted to have the Bone Wyverns appear from the place where the serpent didn’t expect at all, then attack its vital point.<br/><br/>But even that attack was useless.<br/><br/>Dozens of patterns bloomed above the serpent’s head, rotated at high speed, then soared vertically. Then, they began to grind two Bone Wyverns like a mixer.<br/><br/>‘I can’t beat the serpent like this.’<br/><br/>The serpent’s attack was overwhelming. He recalled Drake he had faced before awakening during his raid in Youido. Sungwoo felt a power gap that he could hardly narrow back then, and he was killed miserably by Drake.<br/><br/>‘It’s dangerous. I may have to use the resurrection spell.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not help but fear his death because he felt a bigger difference in power than he did back then.<br/><br/>However, he had one insurance policy. It was a “resurrection spell” he had obtained from the secret store at Kimpo International Airport.<br/><br/>‘But Hanho and Jisu…”<br/><br/>Jisu and Hanho also concentrated on avoiding the flying goblin flames, not knowing what to do. If Sungwoo was killed here, the two would die forever.<br/><br/>So Sungwoo couldn’t give up fighting easily.<br/><br/>But no matter how hard he thought about it, this situation was embarrassing to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Didn’t he clear all the quests with an overwhelming power until now?<br/><br/>Then, how come this quest boss, given to everybody fairly, was so strong when the serpent was not even the field boss monster?”<br/><br/>‘Is there any other strategy this serpent is using now?’<br/><br/>At that moment, a scene suddenly flashed through his mind.<br/><br/>‘Mural?’<br/><br/>The hieroglyphs he saw at the entrance to the cave came to his mind suddenly.<br/><br/>The giant snake drawn in a circle. It was this place where the snake was located.<br/><br/>If so, what’s the next picture? And were there any hints to look for in it?<br/><br/>Sungwoo brought out the memory as best as he could.<br/><br/>‘There was a triangle on the back of the snake.’<br/><br/>As soon as he got to that point, he finally realized it.<br/><br/>‘I should not aim for the snake from the beginning. There is an answer elsewhere.’<br/><br/>-Souls under control by the “Soul Container” (80)<br/><br/>Thanks to one of the new skills of the world tree, , Sungwoo could save the souls of those who died. And he took them out in preparation for this dungeon attack.<br/><br/>-‘Evil Spirit Bomb’ has been embedded in your weapon.<br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately consumed five souls to use the Evil Spirit Bomb. His target was not the giant serpent. He intended to stare at the wall that the serpent had been blocking.<br/><br/>At that moment, an unintelligible message appeared.<br/><br/>-$%#@긝!%67#<br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, tell me what the heck this is.”<br/><br/>Suddenly, some strange messages that he could not understand at all began to come out.<br/><br/>-뀕궭$%%%<a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0f294f" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>긝!(%67#)<br/><br/>-쉙뉅벩빍 #!!$%$$##%!!&amp;*<br/><br/>-The connection to the client server has been terminated due to a fatal error. (ERROR CODE:0014231532)<br/><br/>Something absurd began to happen.<br/><br/>“Oh no! Has this game been forcibly terminated?”<br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo asked the question, all the undead stopped moving in their place.<br/><br/>‘Move, move!’<br/><br/>But even Sungwoo’s order didn’t get through to them as if it was not connected to the server from the beginning. Sungwoo even forgot how to move them.<br/><br/>And that was the same with the giant serpent.<br/><br/>Chiji-chijiji!<br/><br/>The serpent wriggled as if it was electrocuted. Then, it lowered its head and didn’t move anymore.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Since all this happened suddenly, Sungwoo and his party were aghast.<br/><br/>But they could not feel relaxed because they didn’t know what was going to happen all of a sudden.<br/><br/>At that moment, there was a voice heard somewhere.<br/><br/>“Have you ever thought somebody has been watching you?”<br/><br/>It was none other than the giant serpent. It slowly raised its head again.<br/><br/>With its two dark eyes staring at Sungwoo, it said, “But not now. Sungwoo Yu, come to me.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>What the hell is going on?<br/><br/>After pondering over it for a moment, Sungwoo slowly took a step.<br/><br/>Then, he walked forward, saying, “You seem to have something to say to me. I don’t know what the hell is going on, but….”<br/><br/>He was certain of one thing. Right now, the system, the culprit behind all of this, exposed a loophole. And he could find out the whole truth through the loophole, namely the identity of this game.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I think that monster called your name.”<br/><br/>Following the system error, a phenomenon that Sungwoo could hardly understand happened. Like Hanho just said, a monster named “1st Python”, obviously part of the system, called Sungwoo’s name.<br/><br/>‘How does it know my name?’<br/><br/>No matter how great the boss monster is, it was too strange that the monster recognized the real name of a player.<br/><br/>That’s why Sungwoo could instinctively realize something was wrong.<br/><br/>‘There is a problem with the system.’<br/><br/>He didn’t know what the system was yet, but at this moment, it was not something that the system intended at all.<br/><br/>As if to prove it, the giant serpent said something unintelligible.<br/><br/>“There is no time. Only this area is hidden from the Creator, but they will soon notice it.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo frowned unwittingly when he heard that very foreign and eerie word.<br/><br/>“Creator?”<br/><br/>“Of course, he is not your Creator. He is the being that has created my power, this place, and your power.”<br/><br/>It was right that the being was the serpent’s Creator. But my Creator?<br/><br/>To put it simply, it was the being that pushed this hellish system into the world where Sungwoo was living. In other words, the being was the “invader” playing with this world.<br/><br/>“Then, who are they?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know yet. I wasn’t allowed to know their existence.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo tilted his head and asked, “Very strange. I think you already know them to some extent.”<br/><br/>If the serpent was just a dungeon boss monster and a subordinate to the system, wasn’t it natural that it didn’t even know the existence of the Creator?<br/><br/>“Just a moment ago, a certain ‘unknown force’ came inside me. At that moment, I could realize something very small. But that’s not what matters now. Take my words seriously from now on.”<br/><br/>The serpent moved its head and approached Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Its giant head was intimidating just by moving.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo!”<br/><br/>Jisu was about to attack the serpent, but Sungwoo stopped her by stretching her palms. The giant serpent moved its huge mouth right in front of him and whispered.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo Yu, there is someone who wants to contact you. They are also like my Creator. They can’t reveal themselves in person, so they want to use my mind to convey a message to you.”<br/><br/>“The same being…”<br/><br/>The fact that they were trying to secretly contact Sungwoo even though they were on the same type of being as the Creator might mean that the creators of this system were divided into two groups and competing with each other.<br/><br/>“What do they want from me?”<br/><br/>“The collapse of the system.”<br/><br/>In other words, it meant they wanted to end this game.<br/><br/>“But why me? Why do they want to see me?”<br/><br/>But why did they come to seek Sungwoo? Even though Sungwoo had been performing well until now, he has been doing so within the system.<br/><br/>“They have watched everyone and chosen you because you have continuously deviated from the direction set by the system. Sungwoo, survive and overturn the system. They will find an opportunity to contact you and call your name again.”<br/><br/>-The system is under emergency recovery. (13%)<br/><br/>The serpent also slowly raised its head as if it saw the message.<br/><br/>And there was nothing like determination in its eyes. So much so that Sungwoo could feel something like a sense of loss in its eyes, something completely different from what it was when it first appeared in the dark.<br/><br/>The giant serpent continued, “I’ve just realized that my existence is meaningless.”<br/><br/>Then, it turned around and started scratching the wall behind it all of a sudden.<br/><br/>The surface of the wall was a little scratched, and stone debris fell off.<br/><br/>It was the spot where the triangular pattern Sungwoo was trying to aim for was.<br/><br/>‘As expected, is it the serpent’s soft spot?’<br/><br/>It seemed that they gave Sungwoo a hint about how to win this game, thinking Sungwoo didn’t yet notice it. Did those who said they had chosen Sungwoo underestimate him?<br/><br/>-The system is under emergency recovery. (56%)<br/><br/>“They will come back. One of my scales is growing upside down. Kill me and get it secretly.”<br/><br/>“Scales?”<br/><br/>“It is a gift from someone who wants to help you. The power hidden in it will tell you if somebody is monitoring you or not.” </div><h2 id="chapter205">Chapter 205</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Then, the serpent raised itself and began to crush everything around it.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>Jisu and Hanho were very nervous at that terrific scene.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this? Do we have to fight again?”<br/><br/>“No, stay still.”<br/><br/>The serpent was manipulating the traces of the battle to deceive the eyes of the returning “Creator”, for it should not be caught stopping the fight while their surveillance was cut off.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, can you explain what the heck this is? When did you become friends with such reptiles? You guys even know each other’s names, too. Tell me!”<br/><br/>Although they witnessed the same situation, Jisu and Hanho did not seem to understand it easily. The hint that the giant serpent gave him was so abstract that even he could not figure out exactly what was going on right now.<br/><br/>‘What’s certain at this point is that we need to avoid the eyes of this guy called ‘Creator’ who will be back soon.’<br/><br/>While the serpent devastated everything around them, Sungwoo looked at Jisu and Hanho.<br/><br/>“Listen to me carefully. I don’t have time to explain to you right now. When the recovery work in front of you is complete, you have to pretend to fight the serpent again.”<br/><br/>“What are you talking about?”<br/><br/>“Listen to me. I think I can explain to you later, though I’m not that certain.”<br/><br/>Jisu nodded at Sungwoo’s remarks. Hanho, too, scratching his head as if he was frustrated, immediately sent a signal that he understood.<br/><br/>As expected, the two were blindly following Sungwoo, no matter what.<br/><br/>The serpent continued, “Okay, now is the beginning. Sungwoo Yu, kill me and survive to the end. Bring this system down and take back your world.”<br/><br/>-The system is under emergency recovery. (99%)<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo jumped off the ground. The serpent also moved the goblin flame to pursue Sungwoo. They engaged in real fighting without any hesitation.<br/><br/>In order not to invite any suspicion from the ‘Creator,’ the serpent was attacking Sungwoo ruthlessly.<br/><br/>‘If I’m hit by that attack, I’ll be killed!’<br/><br/>Sungwoo ran towards the cliff then threw himself.<br/><br/>The moment he fell, a Bone Wyvern soared from the bottom of the cliff. Sungwoo flew up while hanging on the Bone Wyvern, but the serpent stretched out its head to attack him.<br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>‘This guy deliberately stretched back.’<br/><br/>It was an obvious signal that Sungwoo should attack its soft spot, namely the wall behind.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was already ready for that attack.<br/><br/>While the serpent moved slightly forward, two zombie birds glided in the dark and quickly entered the space behind its back.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>Then, they began to dig up into the wall with their claws that the serpent had already scraped once. The serpent crushed the two zombie birds with its head and dropped them.<br/><br/>“Alright. That’s your soft spot, right?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo noticed it before this fight, but he pretended to have noticed it only now because he was aware the ‘Creator’ was watching him somewhere.<br/><br/>Sungwoo swung the Grim Reaper, loaded with the Evil Spirit Bomb. Four black spheres were fired in a straight line at its head.<br/><br/>Goong-go-go-goong!<br/><br/>A magic circle with a five-bang color pattern floated above its head and blocked the Evil Spirit Bomb without any difficulty.<br/><br/>‘After all, it’s useless to attack the serpent.’<br/><br/>But it was Sungwoo’s tactic to block the vision of the serpent.<br/><br/>Sungwoo dispatched the Bone Wyvern to collide with it head-on.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>However, just before the collision, two goblin flames flew in and smashed the Wyvern’s head to pieces. With the Bone Wyvern’s smashed bones falling, Sungwoo was floating in the air.<br/><br/>However, even that was nothing but trickery.<br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/>Suddenly, Orun was hanging on the wall with his knife stuck into it. A very suspicious triangle was drawn on the wall he was clinging to, which the giant serpent tried to protect.<br/><br/>Orun instantly lifted his hand, biting the hilt, and drew a hand cannon with his right hand. He pulled the trigger.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>Since the crack had already occurred in the wall, Orun could destroy the outer wall with a single shot.<br/><br/>“That’s it!”<br/><br/>A small cavern was inside the wall. There was a gold rope made of twisted threads, along with an ocher pot inside the cavern.<br/><br/>That was the serpent’s greatest weakness.<br/><br/>“Break it!”<br/><br/>At that moment, the serpent pretended to move its body in a hurry. However, it was too late.<br/><br/>Orun already hit his head against the pot. The jar was shattered in an instant as if it had no protective shield.<br/><br/>-‘The precious jar’ of the 1st Python has been destroyed.<br/><br/>* The python has lost all magical powers.<br/><br/>Kaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>Along with that message, the blue energy began to escape from the serpent’s body. The goblin flames munching through the vast space disappeared from the air.<br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>The serpent roared in anger, wiggling its body. And it was a sign that the tide was turned.<br/><br/>“If you can’t use magic, you are nothing but a giant snake, right?”<br/><br/>The giant serpent, which could not use magic, had the same strength as Drake.<br/><br/>In other words, it was not Sungwoo’s difficult opponent anymore.<br/><br/>Based on his promise to the serpent, Sungwoo intensified the attack to kill it.<br/><br/>Now, all ranged attacks by the undead troops paid off, breaking its scales.<br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>The serpent twisted its body and swung its head as if resisting to the end, but it already knew its final moment from the beginning.<br/><br/>Eventually, Minsok, who got on top of its head, stuck his great sword into its forehead.<br/><br/>-You have earned 11,550,000 gold by hunting the boss monster ‘1st Python’.<br/><br/>-Time remaining until full credentials: 1,030 days<br/><br/>-The title of ‘Amateur Dragon Hunter’ has been upgraded (replaced) to ‘Professional Dragon Hunter’.<br/><br/>* Increases stamina (+6)<br/><br/>* Increases muscle strength (+3)<br/><br/>* Increases fire immunity (+40%)<br/><br/>* Increases magic resistance (+10%)<br/><br/>The serpent’s head slowly tilted toward Sungwoo. The light of both eyes, which was burning intensely, also gradually faded. With that look, it seemed to be asking Sungwoo for something.<br/><br/>‘What the hell is the truth of this game…?’<br/><br/>Following the serpent’s advice, Sungwoo began to look for the inverted scales on his body.<br/><br/>He found it on the back of his neck.<br/><br/>Sungwoo naturally scraped it so that his action did not look strange.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: null<br/><br/>-Grade: null<br/><br/>-Category: null<br/><br/>-Effect: null<br/><br/>‘What the heck is this?’<br/><br/>No information was displayed. ‘Null’ meant there was nothing.<br/><br/>But at that moment, a message rang.<br/><br/>-ON AIR (!)<br/><br/>ON AIR, now broadcasting?<br/><br/>The scales of the serpent issued such a message.<br/><br/>Sungwoo now realized that the ‘Creator’ that the serpent referred to was now watching this place.<br/><br/>‘If so, is this message invisible to the Creator?’<br/><br/>He didn’t know how it was possible to avoid the eyes of the being in charge of the system, but the being must have such a function.<br/><br/>‘I have no idea what’s going on now…’<br/><br/>The Creator and the other one like the Creator but with different ideas: who the hell are they?<br/><br/>And why are they playing this game?<br/><br/>There were so many things Sungwoo couldn’t know yet.<br/><br/>Since the Creator said that he would return to him someday, Sungwoo would have no choice but to wait.<br/><br/>-In the war quest , the ‘Third camp (temporary)’ has won!<br/><br/>* Rewards are given to its leader. (5 legendary grade item boxes)<br/><br/>-Prize money is given to the winning camp. (Third camp)<br/><br/>* 1% of total bet amount: 4,086,570 gold<br/><br/>-Winner prediction dividends are paid.<br/><br/>* Third camp dividend: 296,954,695 (73.4%)<br/><br/>Sungwoo received a whopping 300 million gold at once.<br/><br/>After the quest completion message and the reward message came out, light began to pour from the sky as the cave vibrated.<br/><br/>Gung-gu gu gu-<br/><br/>“Uh, Look over there! The ceiling is being opened!”<br/><br/>Mt. Pukhan, which had been covered with caves and trees, was recovering its original shape.<br/><br/>“Hahaha! Now, shall we look at the other guys? Now, it’s clear which camp is winning. Are there any fools who are still trying to choose between the Angel camp and the Demon camp?”<br/><br/>As expected, Hanho, who got a windfall, shouted proudly.<br/><br/>It was the moment when the Third camp took all the profits and proved that they were the strongest group of the Korean server.<br/><br/>But Sungwoo didn’t let down his guard.<br/><br/>‘Are these guys in trouble really going to give up?’<br/><br/>The war quest was over. If so, the “PK prohibited area” on Mt. Pukhan would also have been lifted, logically speaking.<br/><br/>‘I don’t think so.’<br/><br/>Maybe, the other camps wouldn’t give up easily because they must have realized that if they left the Third camp as it was now, they could not suppress the Third camp’s growth.<br/><br/>It was highly likely that their enemies would grab the Necromancer’s pants and bite his neck.<br/><br/>‘If that’s the case, let me get rid of them.’<br/><br/>To overthrow the system, Sungwoo needed to reach the level at which he could control the world they created.<br/><br/>‘The first target is the Korean server.’ </div><h2 id="chapter206">Chapter 206</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>However, since their troops were dispersed widely, the Demon camp could not respond to the Angel camp properly, so they were unilaterally defeated.<br/><br/>“That’s alright. We’re going to accept our defeat for now because it’s more important than anything else to catch up with the Necromancer.”<br/><br/>The Demon camp didn’t give up. Since they bet everything on this battle, they could not give up.<br/><br/>“We’ve found them! Two wasps at 11 o’clock position!”<br/><br/>The Necromancer burned down almost all of the wasps’ nests, but there were some wasps still alive. Some wasps had been away from the nests when the fire burned them down. Besides, there were also hives on the outskirts the Necromancer could not remove. Also, as time passed, new wasp nests were respawning.<br/><br/>-Toxic giant wasp hunting (99/100)<br/><br/>“Just one wasp! We only need to find one!”<br/><br/>“Good! Everyone, open their eyes wide! Let’s grab it quickly and run right away to break the back of the Necromancer’s head!”<br/><br/>They boosted their morale once again with only one more wasp to catch. Although they were behind now, they began to have the hope that they could catch up with the Necromancer.<br/><br/>The next stage had to be the boss stage, so it would be hard for the Necromancer to clear the quest quickly, no matter how strong the Necromancer was.<br/><br/>‘Well, it might be more favorable to us if we attacked him while he is fighting the boss monster,’ Bumyeol thought, cautiously hoping he could kill the Necromancer.<br/><br/>However, at the very moment when they had to catch only one more wasp, a message appeared before their eyes and made the entire Demon camp silent.<br/><br/>-The ‘Python Cave’ dungeon has been conquered.<br/><br/>*Soon the dungeon will disappear.<br/><br/>Along with a short message, huge trees were withdrawn and the ceiling began to open.<br/><br/>Brilliant sunlight poured over their heads.<br/><br/>“Ah, ah….”<br/><br/>“Oh damn it!”<br/><br/>“Necromancer! That son of a bitch!”<br/><br/>The Demon camp couldn’t control their raging anger.<br/><br/>They brought in a whopping 741 men to conquer the cave. They were the total forces of the Demon camp, but 211 out of them were killed.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, they obtained nothing. They just lost a lot. It was a one-sided and humiliating defeat.<br/><br/>“Captain, is our fighting over like this?”<br/><br/>“This is ridiculous! How come we have been defeated like this? Didn’t we keep rising even after we were defeated and conquered the mountain area?”<br/><br/>The warriors of Mt. Taebaek asked Bumyol in dejection. He looked up at the sky silently.<br/><br/>Then, he shook his head as if he was determined about something.<br/><br/>“No, this is the beginning. As you said, we rose after we were defeated. Now is the moment for us to rise again! We’re going to make Mt. Pukhan the Necromancer’s tomb. Everybody, clear for action!”<br/><br/>“Yep! To arms!”<br/><br/>“Get ready again! Even if we keep losing, we will triumph eventually!”<br/><br/>They didn’t want to give up the fight for control of the metropolitan area like this.<br/><br/>Since the quest was over, the “PK Prohibited Zone” would be released, and if so, those who were numerically superior like the Demon camp could be in a favorable position.<br/><br/>“Yes, in a situation like this, that senior man said he would have 320 additional soldiers ready on the outskirts.”<br/><br/>In the meantime, Younghwan Lee, the Chairman of the Reconstruction Alliance, who did not directly participate in the dungeon attack, had prepared “Plan B” for contingencies.<br/><br/>His strategy was named ‘Expel Demon’ and was intended to catch the Necromancer.<br/><br/>The demon camp bet everything on this, and they were determined to fight it out with the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“Let’s catch and kill the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>“Go!”<br/><br/>The self-styled warriors of the mountains began to prepare for the real battle.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>“It’s finally over! The huge dungeon that covered Mt. Pukhan is disappearing by itself!”<br/><br/>Reporter Ahn’s camera was focusing on the mountain ridge. The trees that had been tangled randomly and covered the mountains like a dome were rapidly shrinking.<br/><br/>“Ah! The moment I brought you this news, the winner! The eternal winner! Necromancer is coming out!”<br/><br/>The camera angle turned quickly and focused on one side of the forest road.<br/><br/>The Necromancer team was walking down the road. Sungwoo, Jisu, Hanho, and Minsok were seen emerging from the woods.<br/><br/>“Who the hell doubted him? Surprisingly, this is the moment when the Third camp has defeated the other two absolute races and confidently rose to the top of the Korean server!”<br/><br/>After his request for the interview was ignored when the Necromancer appeared, Reporter Ahn hated him, but at this moment, he had no choice but to cheer for him because it would draw in more viewers to his channel.<br/><br/>At that moment, Jisu, the woman in red standing next to the Necromancer, drew her sword.<br/><br/>Then, she stepped forward all of a sudden.<br/><br/>Since she moved so quickly, no one could respond.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>“What the heck did she do?”<br/><br/>Reporter Ahn and his assistants stiffened their expressions, stunned at the unexpected scene. She blocked the Necromancer with her whole body. She then glared into the air and swung her sword.<br/><br/>Clang! Clang!<br/><br/>At that moment, a bright light erupted when the blade hit something a couple of times.<br/><br/>Shortly afterward, what fell on the ground was a silver arrow cut in half.<br/><br/>As if to prove that it wasn’t an ordinary arrow, it released tremendous energy even though it was cut in half.<br/><br/>“Uh? Surprise attack? Suddenly, someone attacked the Necromancer! The fighting has begun again…”<br/><br/>Even before Reporter Ahn began to broadcast that unexpected fighting, the situation unfolded urgently.<br/><br/>Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh!<br/><br/>The next moment, hundreds of arrows were fired from the forest.<br/><br/>At the same time, the attackers revealed themselves. They were the members of the Skoll Unit that the Reconstruction Alliance was proud of. They started firing numerous arrows.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, they are preparing to shoot again. Let me go and disturb their attack, so get ready,” Jisu said. She couldn’t guarantee she could stop the snipers’ attack. In this situation, it was the best option for her to distract the enemy camp and block the snipers.<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded. After making two bone shields, Sungwoo threw one at Hanho.<br/><br/>Minsok raised the shield he was originally holding.<br/><br/>Jisu put on the “Goblin Face Armor” stretching to her neck and jumped into the arrows pouring down like rain.<br/><br/>Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!<br/><br/>She charged at the enemy camp at great speed, knocking down everything that flew over her head. As she passed, the broken arrows scattered in all directions.<br/><br/>It looked like she was a demon rushing toward them.<br/><br/>“Can you see her? Can you describe her as human? It looks like each member of the Third camp has extraordinary skills.”<br/><br/>That wasn’t all. Using the ‘Shadow Chase’ skill, she quickly reached the place where the snipers were located.<br/><br/>In the blink of an eye, she cut the four players holding axes. Two of them collapsed, cut in half, while the other two fell at the invisible energy of the sword.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>“Stop her!”<br/><br/>That was the starting point of the domino phenomenon. Behind her, the snipers began to fall one by one.<br/><br/>Some of the snipers saw their arms cut while trying to fit the arrows, and even their wrists were severed and floated in the air.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>The warriors whose limbs were amputated leaned against the trees and rolled on the ground, crying out in pain. Their heads, torn from their torsos, rolled downhill.<br/><br/>A devil covered with red blood ran wildly, shaking the enemy camp.<br/><br/>“Stop her!”<br/><br/>“Skoll Troops, retreat!”<br/><br/>“Wizards, pull back!”<br/><br/>Like this, they were forced to focus on the woman in red, so they could not dare to aim for the Necromancer because if they got distracted for a second, they were not sure when they would be beheaded by her. The warriors who allegedly had survived the hellish Mt. Taebaek were stricken with deep fear.<br/><br/>Bumyeol clicked his tongue, watching the unbelievable situation.<br/><br/>“Damn it! What the hell is that crazy bitch! How could she block the arrows?”<br/><br/>He fired the item “Sacred Blood Arrow” at the heart of the Necromancer twice. The two arrows were destined to deal a fatal blow to the Necromancer, which he had planned very carefully.<br/><br/>But no one, including Bumyeol, imagined that the ghostly female samurai lady would destroy the two arrows.<br/><br/>Bumyeol gnashed his teeth and shouted, “I now see why that old man told me to kill that woman first. But I really can’t believe she can fight so well like that!”<br/><br/>But Bumyeol’s assassination plan wasn’t a failure yet.<br/><br/>‘It’s too early for me to give up. I’ve got two more fatal arrows. Let me kill that woman first and wait for the right time to attack the Necromancer.”<br/><br/>Bumyeol revised his plan and lifted his ax at the same time. Then, he began to loosen his thick neck. Of course, he had no intention of confronting that monstrous woman directly.<br/><br/>“Euijin!”<br/><br/>“Yes, Captain!”<br/><br/>“Use that picture! Blow that woman away!”<br/><br/>“Got it!” </div><h2 id="chapter207">Chapter 207</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>The man called Euijin took something out of his backpack.<br/><br/>It was rolled paper, and it looked like Korean paper.<br/><br/>“Alright. Come on! I have prepared an item to deal with an annoying intruder like you.”<br/><br/>Euijin approached her and unwrapped the rolled picture, revealing the scenery of the mountains painted with ink.<br/><br/>-‘The Divine Real Landscape Painting’ has been activated!<br/><br/>At that moment, ink spewed out of the painting. Then, it moved as if it was alive and stretched out toward Jisu.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>When Jisu responded, she could not get out of it.<br/><br/>“Ugh!”<br/><br/>In no time its ink sprayed all over her body. Although she swung her sword, it was useless like cutting through water. Eventually, she was dragged by the ink and sucked into the painting. The painting fluttered where she disappeared.<br/><br/>“Done!”<br/><br/>“Good!”<br/><br/>It wasn’t an item that could kill somebody. Its effect was to send a specific target to a distant space, more precisely, somewhere in Mt. Taebaek.<br/><br/>However, that attack alone could significantly weaken the Necromancer’s power.<br/><br/>Since Jisu, who was almost like his personal bodyguard, was separated from him on the battlefield, the chances of sniping the Necromancer increased twice as much.<br/><br/>“We’ll prevail even after repeated defeats. Get ready for the attack!”<br/><br/>When Bumyol shouted, the warriors who were positioned among the trees came to their senses. They held their weapons and stared at their enemy in front, the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“Attack the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>“Let’s go!”<br/><br/>“Kill him!”<br/><br/>With thundering shouts, the warriors of Mt. Taebaek rushed toward the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Watching them charging at him, Sungwoo threw down the bone shield with dozens of arrows stuck on it. There was faint anger on his face.<br/><br/>“I have warned you many times…”<br/><br/>A green flame from the corners of his eyes spread over his body. Then, a huge black sickle appeared. The moment he grabbed it, black hair began to grow on his body.<br/><br/>-An unknown energy is spreading to the whole area.<br/><br/>With the appearance of a black wolf, Anubis, appeared.<br/><br/>-Bodily functions are weakened due to unknown energy.<br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-1)<br/><br/>When Sungwoo became a deity, this message appeared before the eyes of all the players standing nearby.<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>“What the heck is this…”<br/><br/>The warriors of Mt. Taebaek flinched at the black wolf, suddenly slowing down.<br/><br/>“Don’t be scared!”<br/><br/>“Wait for him to summon the undead!”<br/><br/>They have seen the Necromancer’s combat style several times. They knew he could summon undead troops with black smoke anytime, anywhere.<br/><br/>“It’s dangerous if you get close to him carelessly!”<br/><br/>“Close in on him slowly!”<br/><br/>Therefore, they tried to surround the Necromancer by spreading around him instead of colliding with him recklessly.<br/><br/>They seemed to think the snipers would deal a fatal blow to him while they were distracting him.<br/><br/>At that moment, the Necromancer opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“This is my last warning!”<br/><br/>Gu Gu Gu Gu―<br/><br/>As soon as he said that, there was an unknown vibration in the forest. In the distance, trees were broken and a flock of birds soared. It was an unusual phenomenon.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Everyone turned their eyes in that direction, and even the cameraman started filming there.<br/><br/>There was something huge coming toward them.<br/><br/>Soon, the trees were split and some monster revealed itself.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhh!!”<br/><br/>“Well, what the heck is that monster?”<br/><br/>It was the Giant Serpent called Imoogi, the owner of Mt. Pukhan dungeon. A huge creature made of bones came out of the forest.<br/><br/>Its long body, dozens of meters long, struck the Demon camp.<br/><br/>“As of today, there is no Demon camp on the Korean server.”<br/><br/>A tree was broken entirely, and a huge creature appeared. It was as if the bank burst and the river was pouring out.<br/><br/>As such, this ‘Bone Imoogi’ was different in size from other huge undead that Sungwoo had acquired.<br/><br/>“What the hell is that?”<br/><br/>“So big!”<br/><br/>The size of the serpent’s skull was no different from that of Bone Drake, but it was overwhelmingly long.<br/><br/>It was about 30 meters long excluding its head, which was thicker and longer than the Sea Serpent Sungwoo had used to attack the pirates’ container ship.<br/><br/>Because of its huge body, the serpent could easily devastate the whole area by wriggling only once.<br/><br/>“Avoid the monster!”<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>The Demon camp troops who were besieging the Necromancer while preparing for the emergence of the undead troops never expected such a huge monster would pop out of the forest.<br/><br/>The self-proclaimed “mountain warriors” collapsed miserably after they were swept back and forth by the dynamic movements of Bone Imoogi.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhh!”<br/><br/>“Beat it!”<br/><br/>“Too late!”<br/><br/>No matter how well-organized they were, they couldn’t avoid the oncoming train. Bone Imoogi’s attack had much more destructive power than they thought.<br/><br/>Lots of the Demon camp soldiers were ripped apart by the Imoogi’s attack. Some of them were laid under the heavy weight of the giant serpent and crushed to death.<br/><br/>-You have earned 9,000 gold by killing a player<br/><br/>-You have earned 12,000 gold by killing a player<br/><br/>-You have earned 14,000 gold by killing a player<br/><br/>Bone Imoogi passed through the Demon camp and disappeared into the other forest.<br/><br/>Since its body was so huge, even turning in the other direction was quite a difficult task for the serpent.<br/><br/>A long ditch was dug along the road the serpent passed. There were numerous bodies buried underneath it.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>In the meantime, other undead appeared, including Bone Drake and Ogre Skeleton, and surrounded the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“Damn it! The serpent disappeared!”<br/><br/>“Everybody, line up! Secure the space to target the Necromancer while keeping the undead in check!”<br/><br/>“Don’t be scared! You only need to kill the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>As they were determined to target the Necromancer, they tried to find the right moment to attack him. While watching the numerous battles involving the Necromancer, they realized that it was meaningless to destroy the undead troops. They wanted to get rid of the Necromancer controlling the undead.<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked around the Demon camp while hiding himself among the troll skeletons.<br/><br/>‘The arrow they used a little while ago is similar to the item used by the Evolution Society in Pyeongtaek.’<br/><br/>The undead hit by the arrows containing divine power could not resurrect, which meant they could inflict fatal damage on Sungwoo.<br/><br/>‘Only Jisu could detect the arrows. It is difficult to avoid the arrows unless I find out the location of the guy firing such arrows.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo gained a supernatural sense after turning into the status of Anubis, but it was difficult for him to accurately detect the divine arrows in question.<br/><br/>Besides, it was almost impossible to distinguish a few specific shots with divine power from the hundreds of arrows they were firing.<br/><br/>Of course, if the Necromancer let down his guard, he could be fatally hit by the arrows.<br/><br/>‘I don’t know how many they have of such arrows, but they probably do not have many.’<br/><br/>At first, they only fired two arrows, but no more after that.<br/><br/>In other words, it was clear they had only a few chances to use such arrows. That’s why they were looking for the perfect moment to attack the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, should we keep hiding like this? By the way, what happened to Jisu?”<br/><br/>Jisu disappeared somewhere when they used an unknown item. Sungwoo felt once again how helpful she was in fighting off the enemies.<br/><br/>“By the way, that arrow was weird. I felt like I would be killed if I was hit.”<br/><br/>“Well, we should find out who is firing such arrows.”<br/><br/>“How?”<br/><br/>It wasn’t Sungwoo, but the Demon camp troops who got impatient. The more impatient they were, the more likely they would fire the divine arrows at the wrong moment.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo planned to make them misjudge.<br/><br/>“Keep the defense line behind the tree!”<br/><br/>“Scouts, check out Imoogi’s approach and report back to me!”<br/><br/>Although the cooldown of his major skills such as “Fellblade” and “Death Response” was not over yet, each of the Necromancer’s undead had formidable power.<br/><br/>Besides, they were not sure when Imoogi, which disappeared into the forest on the other side, could come back and disturb the ranks of the Demon camp.<br/><br/>Therefore, the Demon camp got more and more impatient, preparing for the Necromancer and Imoogi’s attack.<br/><br/>“Come on, it’s time you guys came out…”<br/><br/>Kate Kim, the sniper belonging to the Struggle Guild, was watching the battlefield, while he was curled up on a tree.<br/><br/>As a member of the high school archery department, she immigrated to Canada to compete on the professional archery team, so she knew everything depended on the tip of her arrows.<br/><br/>“Let me kill you right away, so come on!”<br/><br/>Her first couple of shots were perfect, but a woman with tremendous senses ruined everything.<br/><br/>But now, that woman was not here.<br/><br/>‘When another opportunity comes along again, let me hit him on the spot.” </div><h2 id="chapter208">Chapter 208</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Kate was armed with the skills and items that gave buff effects to archery, not to mention the senses she had cultivated through her lifelong training.<br/><br/>Moreover, the combination of her first job, “Sniper,” and her second job, “Slayer,” optimized her abilities for long-range shooting. So, missing the target was unthinkable.<br/><br/>‘I succeeded in sniping in a harsher environment than this.’<br/><br/>While traversing deep in the mountains alone in the harsh environment of Mt. Taebaek, she once killed a troll unit of 33 trolls. She also had plenty of experience, so she was confident that if she had a chance, she would never miss the target.<br/><br/>“Now is the time!”<br/><br/>She had another chance to kill him because a Werewolf with a huge scythe in a dark green robe appeared before them. He was the target that she had been eagerly looking for.<br/><br/>“Whew…”<br/><br/>She pulled her bow then stopped breathing. Her fingertips stopped trembling.<br/><br/>The target was standing between a tiny gap about three steps behind two troll skeletons.<br/><br/>The target didn’t know she was aiming at him with a fatal arrow. As always, the prey was supposed to pour out blood under the illusion that they were safe.<br/><br/>Tung!<br/><br/>“You’re the same!”<br/><br/>She muttered, watching the arrow leaving her bow. Then, she smiled in satisfaction.<br/><br/>The moment the arrow left the bow, she usually sensed immediately whether it would hit the target or not.<br/><br/>“I got him this time.”<br/><br/>The silver arrow drew an arc then flew toward the target. The arrow passed through the narrow gap and hit the target. The next moment his body crumbled. The arrow hit the target directly.<br/><br/>But there was something strange.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>She could not see any blood gushing from the target.<br/><br/>It was a white body that was hit by an arrow and collapsed. Why was it white?<br/><br/>She soon made eye contact with a man, standing a few steps next to the target.<br/><br/>‘I am undone!’<br/><br/>The man pulled the dark green robe from the collapsing Werewolf skeleton and wrapped it around his body.<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>The man deliberately exposed a loophole. It was bait. He did it to find the sniper’s location. She calmed down her rough breathing as much as possible.<br/><br/>‘I’ve got only one shot now.’<br/><br/>She hastily loaded one last arrow on the bow, while keeping an eye on the real Necromancer. Even though she failed for the third time, she could kill him because she knew where he was now.<br/><br/>“Uh? Where did he go?”<br/><br/>She didn’t take her eyes off him, but he was not there. Her eyes began to tremble.<br/><br/>She had never missed the target she had once noticed, but the Necromancer disappeared from his place as if he evaporated.<br/><br/>However, from the place where the Necromancer was, she could see two waves soaring into the sky. With her vision that surpassed the human limit, it looked like a ghostly white tablecloth.<br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/>But Kate didn’t look away from him. Since the target was far away from her and not threatening, she felt it was intended to draw her attention. She didn’t fall for such a trick.<br/><br/>“Uh, where are you?”<br/><br/>She quickly rolled her eyes and looked for the target among the undead.<br/><br/>She thought the target was somewhere among them.<br/><br/>At that moment, she threw herself down from the tree.<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>A barrage of arrows was stuck in the tree that Kate left.<br/><br/>“Ugh!”<br/><br/>She rolled on the ground, pulled out an ordinary arrow, and loaded it on the bow.<br/><br/>She then fired it in the direction where the arrows were fired.<br/><br/>The arrow was blocked by a bone shield. The Necromancer was standing right there.<br/><br/>“How dare you…”<br/><br/>He was standing at the edge of the forest, about 300 meters from Kate.<br/><br/>But he was a whopping 150 meters away from the troll skeletons.<br/><br/>The next moment, the Necromancer’s body seeped into the shadows. She realized it was magic, but Kate lost him once more.<br/><br/>Now, she had a lot on her mind.<br/><br/>‘He jumped an enormous distance at once. Did he use the skill of teleporting? But that’s a fairly advanced skill among the wizard-type skills. Can the Necromancer handle it? That doesn’t make any sense.’<br/><br/>Soon, she got scared. It was the moment that she could not figure out how to understand the Necromancer.<br/><br/>But she didn’t give up, even though she could not kill the Necromancer…<br/><br/>‘I don’t want to die!’<br/><br/>There was something she couldn’t give up. Pulling tight on her bow, she watched the surroundings. She believed that even if he was invisible, she could catch him by detecting his presence.<br/><br/>At that moment, something passed over her head. They were tablecloth ghosts. They made eerie cries and passed through the trees.<br/><br/>And the moment she witnessed them, she felt suffocated.<br/><br/>-You are trapped into the curse of ‘Specter’.<br/><br/>* You are stricken with a sense of fear.<br/><br/>*’Your moving speed’ decreases. (-30%)<br/><br/>“Grr… what the hell are you doing?!”<br/><br/>She caught her breath while she was in great chaos. A cold sweat broke out and her heart was pounding, but she somehow tried to calm down.<br/><br/>She wanted to get out of this terrible situation. She became more and more patient.<br/><br/>Rustling<br/><br/>‘Behind my back!’<br/><br/>She quickly turned around and shot an arrow.<br/><br/>Ping!<br/><br/>However, her arrow missed the target because it was smaller than she expected.<br/><br/>It was a goblin skeleton, not Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/>And the muzzle of the hand cannon in his hand was directed at her. In an instant, a sparkle came out of the muzzle.<br/><br/>Although she lifted her arm to block it, scatter shots covered her whole body.<br/><br/>She was thrown up and bumped into a tree. Because she had low defense, she couldn’t endure the damage of a powerful hand cannon.<br/><br/>“If you are impatient, you can’t see the target properly.”<br/><br/>Soon, the Necromancer appeared behind the tree. He approached her casually, then drew a silver arrow from her waistline.<br/><br/>“Is this that arrow?”<br/><br/>Without giving a glance to her, he seemed to examine the arrow closely.<br/><br/>“I think I know who has made this kind of arrow.”<br/><br/>He turned to her, and she realized they would be defeated, no matter what.<br/><br/>She already began to feel something that confirmed her foreboding.<br/><br/>The Demon camp troops began to shout with scared voices.<br/><br/>“It’s coming! Imoogi has appeared!”<br/><br/>Scouts began to announce the appearance of the snake monster.<br/><br/>“Where is it?”<br/><br/>What the scout said next was enough to break the Demon camp’s morale completely.<br/><br/>“It’s coming from behind our back!”<br/><br/>“What? From our back? There is a dense forest behind us!”<br/><br/>“Yes, but it’s coming! Damn it!”<br/><br/>It was rather late that Bone Imoogi that had smashed the Demon camp reappeared like this. But its reappearance at this time was intentional.<br/><br/>In other words, the snake made a big turn around the mountain to inflict a fatal blow in a place that they did not expect at all.<br/><br/>Bone Imoogi twisted its body and began to break down all the trees behind the Demon camp. The thick trees collapsed like millet.<br/><br/>“What the hell is it doing?”<br/><br/>“What is it going to do this time?”<br/><br/>Bone Imoogi was blocking their retreat and removing any cover for them.<br/><br/>In other words, it was now in the process of removing the whole forest behind them.<br/><br/>“Prepare the freezing skill! When the Imoogi gets closer, it will freeze its joints!”<br/><br/>“Good. No problem!”<br/><br/>Since it was relatively thin, compared with its long body, its movement could be restricted if its joints were frozen.<br/><br/>However, the Imoogi didn’t come any closer.<br/><br/>“What the heck? This time what’s it trying to do?”<br/><br/>They began to get scared even before the snake’s attack.<br/><br/>As expected, with the cover of trees disappearing, a huge shadow was cast over the sky.<br/><br/>Bone Wyverns flee down from the sky.<br/><br/>The Necromancer was tricking his enemies with his strategy, turning the tide.<br/><br/>“Nonsense!”<br/><br/>“Shit! That’s why the snake removed the whole forest!”<br/><br/>Since they challenged the Necromancer, they belatedly realized that it was almost impossible to get out of this place.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was looking down on the battlefield from the sky through the ‘Specter’.<br/><br/>He could see everything easily high in the sky as if he was controlling units in a real-time strategy game.<br/><br/>‘It’s much easier to get them all.’<br/><br/>From Sungwoo’s point of view, he not only easily grasped the situation on the battlefield, but also he could control a large number of subordinate spirits in a more favorable position.<br/><br/>‘Now I can respond several times faster, not to mention judging well in advance.’<br/><br/>The Demon camp troops were moving to the position he had expected early on.<br/><br/>Watching them heading out there, Sungwoo muttered, “Let me throw them over their heads.”<br/><br/>When a group of Bone Wyverns’ appeared above their heads, the players of the Demon camp instantly dispersed, running wildly. They got scared even under their shadows.<br/><br/>“Hide in the forest that was not yet destroyed! You will be wiped out if you stay on the ground!”<br/><br/>The Demon camp soldiers hurriedly escaped into the remaining forest, but the Bonn Wyverns dropped something over their heads.<br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaaaah! </div><h2 id="chapter209">Chapter 209</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>However, Sungwoo did not use corpse explosions.<br/><br/>What the Demon camp soldiers experienced was the Giant Jannabi Skeletons Sungwoo procured in the dungeon.<br/><br/>They fell from the back of Bone Wyverns and landed on the remaining trees right above their heads.<br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/>The Giant Jannabi Skeletons were a race with highly developed upper bodies, so they could not fight well on the ground. That’s why Sungwoo didn’t use them from the beginning.<br/><br/>However, these skeletons could show their strength in the forest.<br/><br/>Wooduuuuk!<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>The Giant Jannabi Skeletons dragged the players of the Demon camp, who had been hiding among the trees after avoiding Bone Wyverns, into the treetops as if they were picking up fish from a farm. Then, they broke the players’ necks and threw them away.<br/><br/>Although they could not fight properly on the ground, these skeletons fought like commandos in the forest.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>“They are too fast! We can’t respond to their attack!”<br/><br/>They could not get out of the forest because they would be instantly exposed to the attacks of other large skeletons and Bone Wyverns.<br/><br/>The Necromancer pressed the Demon camp hard by dispatching the undead in the correct positions as if he had been watching them all along.<br/><br/>Now, the Demon camp soldiers were in a complete dilemma.<br/><br/>“Where are the reinforcements? Why aren’t they coming?” Bumyol shouted.<br/><br/>According to Younghwan, the Chairman of the Reconstruction Alliance, a large number of support troops were on standby nearby. However, they hadn’t even appeared in such an emergency.<br/><br/>“We were in touch with them right before this batter, so I have no idea why they haven’t appeared.”<br/><br/>“Damn it! Have they deserted us? That cunning dotard has deceived us? Our plan fell flat!”<br/><br/>Bumyol finally had to admit all his plans had failed.<br/><br/>He realized that the slogan of the Struggle Guild, “We’ll Prevail After Losing!”, could not work for the Necromancer.<br/><br/>‘If we lose to him, that’s it. We don’t have any chance in the future.’<br/><br/>So, Bumyol was determined to resist to the end.<br/><br/>“Uijin, take out the wooden box.”<br/><br/>“That item is…”<br/><br/>“We have no other option now. So, take it out!”<br/><br/>Uijin reluctantly opened his backpack and pulled out a wooden box with an amulet.<br/><br/>“How about considering retreating?”<br/><br/>“No! Even if we survive here, we have nothing left. Nothing… We can’t even go back to Mt. Taebaek.”<br/><br/>“Why don’t we go back and challenge the monster?”<br/><br/>“No, we can’t stop him!”<br/><br/>Bumyol broke open the amulet and opened the box. There was ginseng with red energy inside the box.<br/><br/>He reached out his thick hand and picked up the ginseng. After hesitating several times, he eventually put it in his mouth.<br/><br/>-‘Mountain Spirit’ is spreading throughout your body.<br/><br/>* All stats increase significantly. (+15)<br/><br/>* Gain auto-healing effect. (5% per second)<br/><br/>* Temporarily gain the ‘ power of the mountain god’ and greatly increase your influence on natural objects. (+80%)<br/><br/>* Affinity and dominance for all spirits are greatly increased. (+50%)<br/><br/>– Warning! Your fitness level is lower than what you can take. The ‘Mountain Spirit’ effect is temporarily applied to your body, but terrible pain and penalties are inflicted after it expires.<br/><br/>– Warning! The “mountain spirit” that has entered your body is absorbing your stats. If you leave it as it is for a long time, it can lead to death.<br/><br/>The “ginseng with the mountain god spirit” was a reward Bumyol received after completing the “Hidden Quest” in Mt. Taebaek.<br/><br/>According to the item description, anybody who wanted to eat it should have a physical strength level of 80, so Bumyol had to save it until he reached that level, but he could not afford to save it now.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhh!”<br/><br/>With his skin turning red, he screamed and vomited blood. It was a side effect of his accepting a force that he could not endure, but soon he raised his upper body upright.<br/><br/>“Hahaha. My strength is overflowing now!”<br/><br/>He temporarily gained tremendous strength, along with confidence.<br/><br/>“I can win.”<br/><br/>Bumyol’s primary job was ‘a strong man’ and the job he chose as a link card was ‘spirit magician (soil)’.<br/><br/>The two professions created synergy, so he could use spirit magic with tremendous destructive power. Now, he could double his ability by receiving the mountain spirit.<br/><br/>“All I have to do is ignore the undead and kill the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>He lifted the ax with his arm with protruding veins. Then, the ax blade began to glow green.<br/><br/>“The power of the earth!”<br/><br/>He lifted the ax and struck the ground with all his might.<br/><br/>“Smash the earth!”<br/><br/>A crack began to occur in the place where his ax touched.<br/><br/>Right after that, the ground cracked like a spider web and waved, then rose like a wave.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>Everything around him was swept away in the shock.<br/><br/>Not only the players of the Demon camp but also the Necromancer’s undead, couldn’t stand where they were because of the tremendous vibration. It looked as if everything on the whole battlefield stopped all at once.<br/><br/>“Necromancer! Come out!”<br/><br/>Only Bumyol standing in the middle of the battlefield shouted. He noticed Reporter Ahn’s camera far away and opened his mouth again.<br/><br/>“Necromancer! Come out! Let’s have a duel! I know you are nothing because you are hiding all the time behind the skeletons!”<br/><br/>It seemed as if he was challenging the Necromancer openly for a fight.<br/><br/>“If you hide behind the skeletons like that, anybody can fight well. But you’re only a coward who doesn’t know how to fight without the skeletons.”<br/><br/>He kept provoking the Necromancer blatantly to achieve his purpose. He walked toward the camera with big strides.<br/><br/>“All players on the Korean server watching this scene! Don’t you agree with me? Don’t you have any doubts about the real identity of the Necromancer?”<br/><br/>Did his open provocation work? Indeed, the Necromancer appeared. He walked out of the trees, putting the Grim Reaper at an angle on his shoulder.<br/><br/>“Man, there was another guy who challenged me recklessly once…”<br/><br/>But Bumyol scoffed at the Necromancer’s words.<br/><br/>“I am different. I survived and will survive with my strength. How long are you going to deceive people? Can you confidently say that you are strong?”<br/><br/>“You are gonna make me say it?”<br/><br/>Reporter Ahn’s camera was filming the two players facing each other. Though they didn’t talk at the moment, the results of their fighting would show who was superior.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The ground was turned over, messing up everything. The players of the Demon camp and Sungwoo’s undead army got tangled here and there as if they were in a disaster area.<br/><br/>“Cough! Cough!”<br/><br/>“Ahhhh.”<br/><br/>Hanho also got up from the messy scene. When he came to his senses, there were only people around him who were not damaged at all.<br/><br/>“Uh, what the heck?”<br/><br/>Hanho had no choice but to be embarrassed.<br/><br/>“Oh, how are you?”<br/><br/>“What are you?”<br/><br/>“You bastard! You must belong to the Necromancer team!”<br/><br/>It was because there weren’t not many who were on Hanho’s side.<br/><br/>Five players of the Demon camp raised their weapons after surrounding Hanho.<br/><br/>“Kill him!”<br/><br/>“Wait a minute!”<br/><br/>Stepping back, Hanho waved at them.<br/><br/>“Well, let me pray once before I die!”<br/><br/>“What did you say?”<br/><br/>“What? Prayer?”<br/><br/>While they were embarrassed by his words, Hanho put his hands together, bowing down deeply. He seemed to be praying, but the players of the Demon camp scoffed at him.<br/><br/>“Hahaha! What the heck are you doing?”<br/><br/>“This idiot is a friend of the Necromancer’s?”<br/><br/>At that moment, the patterns drawn on Hanho’s back and robe began to shine.<br/><br/>-‘Asura’s Arm’ has been activated.<br/><br/>-‘Asura’s Arm’ activation time: 00:09:59<br/><br/>Hanho slowly raised his head with a broad smile on his face.<br/><br/>“You idiots! Don’t you know why I prayed?”<br/><br/>Four arms spread behind Hanho’s back.<br/><br/>“I was going to pray for your peaceful rest!”<br/><br/>The four arms pulled the daggers from his waist.<br/><br/>As a result, a total of six arms spread like a Ferris wheel.<br/><br/>On the one hand, it looked gorgeous as if a scarab broke out of its pupa and spread its long legs.<br/><br/>“Yeah, this is what I want to show them!”<br/><br/>Hanho moved his arms. Considering the fact that he usually fought with only two arms, maintaining the sacred shield of the “Slayer of Faith”, his power had increased dramatically since then.<br/><br/>“By the way, it’s high time I used my new item, the ‘Ghost Dagger.'”<br/><br/>Hanho smiled as broadly as possible because he had to do it this time.<br/><br/>As expected, the players surrounding him were shocked at his expression.<br/><br/>But Hanho felt satisfied with what he just did.<br/><br/>“Damn it, what the heck is that crazy bastard doing?”<br/><br/>“He’s disgusting! Look at the number of his arms!”<br/><br/>“Oh, disgusting!”<br/><br/>When he heard them expressing displeasure at his eerie look, Hanho felt bad.<br/><br/>“What did you say? My looks are disgusting? I don’t think you don’t have any aesthetic sense! Then, let me punish you as the strongest holy Asura thief!”<br/><br/>“Bullshit!”<br/><br/>“Just kill him!”<br/><br/>Soon, a battle between them broke out.<br/><br/>Hanho fired the “Ghost Blade”, the effect of the newly acquired item “Ghost Dagger,” killing one of them. At the same time, he triggered the ‘Slayer of Faith’ to protect himself with a golden shield.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>What happened next was always the same. Since they could not break the shield, Hanho was like an invincible enemy to them.<br/><br/>“Kheeeeee!” </div><h2 id="chapter210">Chapter 210</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>-You have earned 9,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have gained a ‘Holy Shield’ for 15 seconds thanks to the ‘Slayer of Faith’ skill. (400/400)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Who are you bastard?” One of the players shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, you still don’t know me? I’m the strongest and holy Asura thief!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man who was following the Necromance around was known as a dumb guy, but Hanho ranked 23 on the server at level 15.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Given his stats, he was as strong as any decent player. Besides, all sorts of odd skills and items created strange synergies, so he could get rid of enemies without getting injured at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Great! Wonderful! Perfect!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He swung six arms back and forth like a spider wrapping its prey in the web and defeated the players of the Demo camp one by one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You crazy filthy monster, go away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 10,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 9,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Man, ain’t I cool? I am no longer a weak player who used to confront the goblins or the pirates in Kanghwa Island! I’ve evolved!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, Hanho even became conscious of the people around him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Oh, my God! Is the cameraman filming my fight?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Reporter Ahn and his assistants were broadcasting the fierce fight between the Necromancer team and the Demon camp soldiers, and Hanho stood out among his team members at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Well, they have no choice but to film my activities. Are they going to make a fan club for me? Gosh, I wish I had practiced writing down my signature!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Convinced that the cameraman was taking shots of his activities, Hanho stretched out his six hands in all directions as if a peacock was spreading its tail wings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Phew… you guys are…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muttering like that, he slowly turned his head in the direction of the camera.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he shouted cheerfully, “You guys are too slow…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the camera angle was pointing in the opposite direction to capture the best star on the Korean server, the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“To become a superhero, I think I’ve got to be independent of him. I can’t shake off my image as an assistant of the Necromancer as long as I stay with him,” said Hanho, laughing bitterly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I wonder if Robin next to Batman feels like me. A star-crossed dark horse… Well, it’s okay with me for now….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, what the cameramen were following intensively was something important enough to draw everybody’s attention.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Almost when the fierce battle between the two camps was at an end, their leaders were going to have a one-on-one confrontation. It was a breathtaking event, so it was natural that all the cameras were fixed on that fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Reporter Ahn was so impressed by the Necromancer’s fighting he was speechless for a while. His assistant camera operators felt the same.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ahn soon came to his senses after realizing he forgot to explain to his audience the fighting scenes for so long. Then, he mentioned something that his audience could agree with.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God! What happened a moment ago?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Inside the still camera angle, the Necromancer was looking down at someone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As I told you, there is someone who said the same thing as you. Now, you are the second.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A red-skinned giant was lying down helplessly under his feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their duel was over so quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer was standing in the place where Reporter Ahn and his assistants turned all the cameras. Numerous trees around him were broken down, and the whole ground was overturned, strewn with blood everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the traces of such a rough fight revealed graphically, the Necromancer in the form of a black wolf was standing tall alone. It was strong evidence that he was the winner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer defeated the challenger without using his subordinate spirits. The loser was lying under his feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuhuuuuuuuuuh, Kuh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was none other than the red-skinned giant, Bumyol, the head of the Struggle Guild.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He vomited blood, and his whole body was covered with blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he barely said, shaking his head, “How did I get defeated like this? My stats were ahead of you, though my level was not…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He muttered as if he couldn’t understand the situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo responded, “It looks like you received a lot of extra stats at the hidden quest?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bumyol just looked up at Sungwoo without refuting him. As he said, Bumyol’s level was 18, ranked 10th on the Korean server, which lagged far behind Sungwoo’s level 22.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, he survived the hellish Mt. Taebaek and received several bonus stats after clearing all kinds of hidden quests. So, he thought that his strength would be comparable to those ranked in the top five of the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Although I was a bit short of the required level, I could overcome it by eating fresh ginseng and receiving the mountain spirit.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He ate the “ginseng with the mountain god’s spirit” at the risk of his health, and as a result, he gained a tremendous increase in his abilities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So he thought he could defeat the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why do you think that only you walked a special path? Did you say you were a warrior of Mt. Taebaek? I think you are trapped in a very autistic narcissism.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer’s criticism frustrated Bumyol. His point was Bumyol was like a frog in a well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No! No!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he denied reality and exerted all his strength to pick up his ax.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He swung his ax at the Necromancer’s neck, but the latter acted faster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was Bumyol who had his head cut off by the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 145,000 gold by killing a player who gained ‘special strength’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer’s final blow meant that their fight was over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the blunt noise of something falling, the players of the Demon camp began to lay down their weapons. It was a declaration of surrender.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they realized they were driven into a corner with no way out and their leader was killed, it was natural they lost the fighting will.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We lost. Please, just spare our lives!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Uijin, the player who appeared to be the deputy commander of the Struggle Guild, approached and begged for his life cowardly. However, Sungwoo ignored him and checked the items on the ground first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It looked like beads with strong energy, but its texture was close to clay.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Tolerance of Mt. Taebaek<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: consumption<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: By accepting the ‘mountain spirit’, you can get a tremendous increase in stats. Also, your ‘affinity and dominance’ over nature and spirits increases drastically, and in some cases, you can obtain the ‘power of the mountain god (deity)’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*Caution! To fully absorb it, you need a ‘physical strength value ‘ of at least 80. (Recommended value: 100)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Caution! If you have a different ‘deity’, they can conflict with each other and have adverse effects.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: A ‘tolerance’ has been formed because an unqualified person absorbed ‘the ginseng with the mountain god’s spirit’ and had his strength sucked by the ginseng. This tolerance has absorbed the stats of the arrogant person, becoming stronger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This item had the effect of giving its owner the ‘deity’ status. However, given that there was no clash between the Necromancer and Bumyol, it seemed that the latter didn’t meet the conditions for eating the ginseng with the mountain god’s spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at Uijin who was awkwardly hesitating to speak to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was stunned as if he was electrocuted when Sungwoo turned to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Where did she go?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? Who do you mean…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The woman in the red sweatshirt!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo asked him about Jisu’s whereabouts because he saw Uijin sucking her up with some paper. Then, he put down his backpack and hastily pulled out something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Here you are!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Uijin took out something with trembling hands. It was a rolled paper.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo carefully received it and checked the item information.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Real Landscape Painting of the God’s Spirit<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: consumption<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Instantly moves the ‘designated object’ to the position in the picture. (Cooldown: 96 hours)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Where is it in this picture?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It is the deepest place on Mt. Taebaek.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Mt. Taebaek? Is it a safe place?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although Sungwoo was not worried about her safety, he still wanted to know exactly where she was now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Uijin said, shaking his head, “No, it’s not safe.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why? Didn’t you say that you guys killed all the monsters in Mt. Taebaek?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the Struggle Guild joined the Demon camp, they said emphatically on the air that they fought several monsters on the hellish mountains and killed them all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, it’s partly true, but it was a lie.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he confessed that they had not yet killed all the monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We tried our best to get rid of them all, but couldn’t. Since the mountains were so deep, the monsters got stronger and increased all the more. They even fought among themselves for hegemony, and after all, one monster unified all of them in one area…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He swallowed, then continued, “The King of the Great Mountain was born.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>King of the Great Mountain?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is that?”<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter211">Chapter 211</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Uijin’s face became even paler. As if he was scared of the King of the Great Mountain or the repercussions of sending Jisu off to such a remote area, he continued with trembling lips.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, we couldn’t confirm his existence. We only saw the quest message. We could not even confront his subordinates, so we finally decided to move to another area.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s why you guys decided to join the Demon camp, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, that’s right. They have grown stronger, so they are exerting influence outside the mountain area. I dare say that he is a monster of a different nature created by the Hidden Quest linkage.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Struggle Guild could be called one of the strongest forces within the Korean server. So, if it’s true they came out of the mountains for fear of the monster and joined the Demon camp to confront the Necromancer, the ‘King of the Great Mountain” must be a very difficult monster to deal with.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘So annoying. If this is a growing monster, it’s not good to let him grow like that.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ‘Hidden Quest’ came into being as the remnants of the “Warlord Monster” hid on Mt. Taebaek. As always, the ‘Hidden Quest’ created variables.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Furthermore, if the Hidden Quest kept repeating itself and connected as Uijin said, it was highly possible that a tremendously huge monster would be born.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It looks like things got worse because the Struggle Guild members kept challenging the Hidden Quest they could not clear.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo resurrected Bumyol as a skeleton to obtain additional information, but his “fragmentary memory” didn’t come about. It seemed that he couldn’t get any other information.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another force appeared on the battlefield where the fighting was over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Four helicopters crossed over a small peak and dropped troops throughout the forest. They were none other than the Crusaders Team members of the Angel camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the Crusaders, including Junghoon and Minhum walked out of the forest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hi, Junghoon. What has brought you here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The look on his face was not good at all because his troops failed to attack the dungeon, and what happened after that was more shocking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As expected, you have destroyed them all. We intended to fight the Demon camp in this area and mount a hard attack on their main forces, but you have already…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He paused for a moment, then continued, looking around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, there was a reinforcement army of the Demon camp on standby nearby. Probably, after the quest was over, it seemed that they were going to attack my forces and yours at the same time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Junghoon said, the Demon camp prepared for the next battle after the quest by deploying the reinforcement unit near Mt. Pukhan as Plan B.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We noticed their trick and responded.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their trick was caught by the Wide Area Surveillance Team, the intelligence unit of the Liberation Guild. Since they had been spying on the enemies’ movement for quite a long time, they could collect information much more quickly than other camps.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Based on that information, the Crusaders made a surprise attack on the reinforcement unit of the Demon camp. That’s why they could not come to the rescue of the Struggle Guild led by Bumyol when they were in the thick of fighting the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Most of them were firepower units made up of flame-type wizards and spirit magicians. It seemed that they planned to destroy a specific area entirely in contingencies. But they couldn’t do anything and finally surrendered when we closed in on them and pressed them hard. But we have come to…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jungwoo cut short his words then looked around. The forest was forcibly removed, and the Demon camp player’s bodies were strewn everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As it turned out, we saved them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What Junghoon said was that they saved the reinforcement troops of the Demon camp who almost made the wrong choice instead of helping the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, things would have changed even if the reinforcement unit had arrived on time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But you could not have saved the other guys,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?” Hunghoo asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Other guys?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I have a suggestion for you. Let me get rid of the annoying guys in the northern part of the metropolitan area. Then, you guys of the Liberation Guild can occupy the metropolitan area easily.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon flinched for a moment at his words because he sensed that there might be a reason when the Necromancer gave him such an offer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You’re talking about the Reconstruction Alliance of Uijongbu, right? Well, I guess you might want to ask us a favor for such an offer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, but it’s not that difficult. Can you give me some information on Mt. Taebaek by mobilizing the Wide Area Surveillance Team, especially the Mt. Solak area? It seems that Jisu was dropped somewhere there by the enemy’s magic, but she seems to have gotten into trouble, given that she could not contact the community yet.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho had been watching the community carefully, but he lost track of her. Something really bad could have happened to her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having heard it, Junghoon nodded slowly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, I’ll help you because this is not a strategic issue.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon was in a rivalry with Sungwoo, but he didn’t have to create a hostile relationship with Sungwoo. Besides, this was part of the “friendly diplomacy” that Junghoon had in mind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you. I believe you won’t hide any information from us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Of course not!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After Sungwoo made the case for the necessity of an intelligence unit, Junghoon trained a large number of players in the assassin occupation group, such as bandits who could not play a big role in group battles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, he was gradually improving his ability to gather information by finding out a synergy formula specialized in “exploration” and “intrusion.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo believed the Wide Area Surveillance Team would surely be able to find the whereabouts of Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two joined hands after a long time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Reporter Ahn and other camera operators were broadcasting all these scenes live.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you see him now? As always, the necromancer has prevailed, but we still can’t believe his victory. Who would have thought that this huge Imoogi would appear as the Necromancer’s subordinate spirit?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a message rang.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 13)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have successfully cleared the ‘Hidden Quest’ .<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Rewards are given. (Exclusive Skill)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Additional functions will be opened. (Viewers’ support function)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since Reporter Ahn was broadcasting for several hours in a row, drawing 110,000 viewers on his broadcast, he was gaining a lot of EXP at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Viewers’ support function? It was like a jackpot to him. He glanced at the message and continued the broadcast with a smile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can’t interview the Necromancer right now, but as you can see now, he is talking with the Angel camp about something…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment he turned, pointing behind his back, he witnessed an unexpected scene and stiffened his face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, uh….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer was approaching him, staring at him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is going on…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was at a loss what to do. Even if he was a professional reporter, he could not stay calm when the man who survived the heinous battle was getting closer to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the end, the Necromancer opened his mouth first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can I just say one word?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, yes, please! You can say as much as you want!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>An exclusive interview with the Necromancer, and at this very important moment at that?<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was the moment for Reporter Ahn to develop his broadcast as the best broadcasting agency of the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer looked at the camera and opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I will destroy the main base of the Demon camp today. Since they attacked me first, I have no intention of showing them any mercy. Let me give them a warning before blowing away the whole region.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He paused for a moment then continued in a heavy voice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The undead do not distinguish between people. They only make a distinction between living and dead. Those who don’t want to die, run away. Evacuate with your families. This is my only mercy to you. Nobody in that area will be alive by tomorrow morning.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, he turned right away. Reporter Ahn kept opening and closing his mouth, missing the opportunity to ask additional questions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he announced in an urgent tone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Players of Uijongbu! If you’ve seen this broadcast, just hurry up and run away. Send the kids and old people to a different place! I, Reporter Ahn, am now delivering you an important message from the Necromancer from the Mt. Pukhan battlefield!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He approached the camera and pretended to cut his neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please don’t confront the Necromancer!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And exactly 23 minutes after the message was announced, those in Uijongbu turned on the broadcast.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the Necromancer already gave them a grave warning, the entire Korean server paid attention to what kind of response they would come up with.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man they saw for the first time appeared on the screen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His face showed he was defeated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everybody, are you coming out now? Ah…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he took out a prepared script and he started reading it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We surrender unconditionally. I would like to inform you that Younghwan Lee and the executives of the Reconstruction Alliance already left this place in fear an hour ago.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the screen of the broadcast was a statue covered with vinyl. The object was being loaded onto a truck by five men.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Although we were left behind like this, we don’t have any hostility to the Necromancer, and we will be waiting for the Necromancer after taking out the devil’s statue and disarming ourselves. So, please have mercy on us…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They issued a declaration of unconditional surrender.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, Sungwoo obtained another statue.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The creation of the Third camp was around the corner. </div><h2 id="chapter212">Chapter 212</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>The Necromancer entered the northern building of Uijongbu City, the home of the Demon camp without any bloody fighting.<br/><br/>As mentioned in the Demon camp’s broadcast, the chairman and other executives of the Reconstruction Alliance had already fled the city. They quickly escaped after realizing they had no more power to maintain their forces after they were completely defeated in the battle in Mt. Pukhan.<br/><br/>Thud-<br/><br/>When Sungwoo’s Bone Wyvern landed on the edge of the square of the government building called “Kyonggi Peace Plaza,” a man in a suit walked out. He was the man who appeared on the air.<br/><br/>“Welcome! I would like to welcome you to this place.”<br/><br/>He couldn’t hide his nervousness when he encountered the Necromancer because he was stricken with fear that if he rubbed the Necromancer wrong, his forces could be annihilated.<br/><br/>“I am Minchol Lee, and I used to run a shelter in the Uijongbu area. Well, please understand that after the Reconstruction Alliance came here from the northern area, we were dominated by them against our will, and we were forced to join their operation.”<br/><br/>Minchol, who appeared to be the leader of those who were left behind, made clear that his forces were no longer aligned with the Reconstruction Alliance. Minchol tried to avoid his responsibility by insisting that they were forcibly controlled by the Demon camp.<br/><br/>However, no matter his excuses, Sungwoo didn’t care. He fixed his eyes only on the “Devil Statue” in the middle of the square.<br/><br/>It was a sacrifice they dedicated to the Necromancer.<br/><br/>‘This is the third and last statue.’<br/><br/>Without replying to Minchol, Sungwoo walked to the center of the square.<br/><br/>“He is the Necromancer…”<br/><br/>“Gosh, will he kill us?”<br/><br/>The players of the Demon camp stood some distance away from the statue. They looked like the people of a country that lost a war.<br/><br/>Sungwoo, who was like the leader of the victor country, stood in front of the “Devil’s Statue”, an important symbol of the Demon camp. They watched him.<br/><br/>It was a black stone statue with horns with its wings half spread to cover its chest.<br/><br/>‘That looks ugly.’<br/><br/>The statue held a long spear upside down with its right hand. It was in dynamic motion as if it would hit Sungwoo.<br/><br/>It was holding a glass of fire in its left hand, from which something was flowing. As a result, a dark flame was rising from beneath its feet.<br/><br/>‘The Angel Statue was holding a sword and a crown, right? What does it mean?’<br/><br/>The stone statues seemed to imply something that each camp signified.<br/><br/>“Whatever it is, they won’t make it happen.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo then looked around.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>The players of the Demon camp were looking at Sungwoo with vigilant eyes. Of course, most of them were full of awe and fear.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, it could not be ruled out that they lured Sungwoo into this place to snipe him. Besides, this was an open place, so it was more dangerous to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, it was not easy for Sungwoo to detect their movement because Jisu was not around him at the moment. That’s why he had to defend himself as best as he could.<br/><br/>Oooooooh-<br/><br/>Long before Sungwoo landed in the square, he was monitoring every nook and corner of the area carefully by flying “Spector” in the air. Two ghosts wandered around the office building, creating an eerie atmosphere.<br/><br/>In addition, Sungwoo dispatched zombie birds in various places on the rooftop. He was even ready to escape using ‘shadow teleport’ by creating a shadow in an emergency.<br/><br/>‘Okay, no problem.’<br/><br/>After checking everything, Sungwoo stretched out his right hand into the air, where the black Grim Reaper bloomed.<br/><br/>The Devil Statue split diagonally and collapsed in an instant.<br/><br/>-The Demon camp has increased the bounty on your head.<br/><br/>*Demon camp’s bounty: 50,000,000 gold<br/><br/>“Ah, my level…”<br/><br/>“Mine went down, too.”<br/><br/>At the same time, sighs came out here and there. Since they failed to protect the statue, they were given a strong penalty. They paid dearly for the price of their wrong choice of the Demon camp.<br/><br/>However, the destruction of the statue gave Sungwoo a tremendous benefit.<br/><br/>-Third option: Destroy the statutes of the Absolute Race (3/3)<br/><br/>-You have successfully attacked the Hidden Quest .<br/><br/>* You are given a reward. (Opportunity to establish the Third camp)<br/><br/>Finally, Sungwoo had cleared the ‘hidden quest’ for the formation of his camp.<br/><br/>[Camp Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: Great Moment, the founding of a camp<br/><br/>-Type: Decision<br/><br/>-Goal: Selection of the main base of the camp<br/><br/>-Reward: Initial operating fund (30,000,000 gold)<br/><br/>*You have passed the test to become the founder of a new camp. And finally, you are qualified to create a regular camp. The first task of creating your camp is to designate your ‘main base.’ For the endless development of the camp, you should select a safe and excellent area and lay the foundation for the long-term project of your camp.<br/><br/>* You must designate your main base within 72 hours.<br/><br/>* Once you designate it as your main base, you can’t arbitrarily change it.<br/><br/>Now, Sungwoo was given the final choice to create a camp. He had to decide on a place to use as the main base for the camp.<br/><br/>‘Well, I’ve already decided on that.’<br/><br/>He was thinking of the place where the world tree was growing.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, he found an item that emitted black light among the fragments of the fallen statue.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Devil’s horn shard<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: disposal item<br/><br/>-Effect: When using it, you can move to the ‘Devil Statue’ within a certain range. (1 time) * Angel camp and the Third camp cannot use it.<br/><br/>-Description: If the statue is destroyed, it is used as a final emergency escape.<br/><br/>It was an item with the same function as the Angel’s Wing Sungwoo had used previously. However, the ‘Third camp’ was also included in the list of use restrictions.<br/><br/>When Sungwoo attacked the pirates in Taiwan, he used the Angel’s Wing shard to ambush them.<br/><br/>At the time, he used the loopholes of the system that those players who did not belong to any camp had no restrictions, but it seemed that they were judged as members of an official camp.<br/><br/>When Sungwoo turned, Minchol approached him and said, “Necromancer, can you do me a favor?”<br/><br/>“Yes, go ahead.”<br/><br/>Hesitating a bit, Minchol pointed to the players who came out to the square.<br/><br/>“We were penalized for donating the Devil Statue to you. We were given the curses of leveling down and expelled from the Demon camp.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo could easily guess what he wanted to say next.<br/><br/>Minchol continued, “Well, could you accept us as the leader of the Third camp? We were forcibly subjugated to the Demon camp, so…”<br/><br/>Whoo- boom!<br/><br/>Bone Wyvern Alpha Male landed behind Sungwoo. Stunned, Minchol stepped back.<br/><br/>“I’m sorry, but this is not the right time to accept you. And…”<br/><br/>Having said that, Sungwoo got on the Bone Wyvern.<br/><br/>“We don’t force players to join us nor do we accept them easily. So, prove you are worthy enough to join us.”<br/><br/>Proving what? Minchol felt like he was freaking out, but since he was here as the representative of many players in his group, Minchol had to find a way to prove their worth.<br/><br/>“Well, how can we prove our worth?”<br/><br/>“Make me come here and ask for your help.”<br/><br/>Minchol’s jaws dropped at that. How could he make the Necromancer come to him for help? How could he do that?<br/><br/>After saying terrible things like that, Sungwoo got on the Bone Wyvern quickly and soared into the air. It was time for him to return to Suwon.<br/><br/>Without shutting his mouth, Minchol was looking to the place where the Necromancer disappeared.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Sungwoo and Hanho did not proceed with the formation of the Third camp immediately when they arrived in Suwon.<br/><br/>Based on his experience, Sungwoo knew he was faced with an unexpected crisis right after clearing a quest that would bring about a big change. That’s what happened when he planted the world tree recently. Who would have expected that a bunch of Wyverns would storm his area in droves?<br/><br/>That’s why he had the villagers check their security and prepare for the unexpected situation. In other words, they were fully prepared for war.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, he told Hanho to watch the community bulletin closely because any movement by a hostile force could be exposed to the community. Above all, he needed to find out Jisu’s whereabouts, who went missing several days ago.<br/><br/>However, Hanho shook his head shortly after checking the community bulletin carefully.<br/><br/>“I can’t find any posts uploaded by Jisu. I’m worried something bad happened to her. Sungwoo, is she okay?”<br/><br/>“Yeah, she will be fine.”<br/><br/>As far as he knew, she was not the type of woman who could be easily defeated by the enemy. After gaining overwhelming sensory abilities, she was accumulating extraordinary foresight. Besides, Junghoon promised to find her whereabouts, so Sungwoo believed they could find her sooner or later. </div><h2 id="chapter213">Chapter 213</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Inho came and said, “Sungwoo, we have placed additional security guards in the area. They will immediately detect anyone approaching the invisible barrier. We also have warmed up the Iron Mace of Lightning, so we can fire them as soon as we notice something strange.”<br/><br/>“Good job!”<br/><br/>“And the entire village is ready for the battle, fully armed.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded and went out of the building.<br/><br/>A huge tree was casting a shadow in the square.<br/><br/>-The world tree (2nd stage of growth) is growing. (83%)<br/><br/>It had grown to a height of about 24 meters, about 8 stories high. The world tree could be easily noticed in nearby areas.<br/><br/>Aside from the fact that it was unrealistically large for a tree, the beams of light were spreading from its roots to its lush branches.<br/><br/>“Well, we don’t need any light at night thanks to the tree. The light is not that strong, but we feel it is unique because there is no light anywhere in this ruined world. All around the clock, it is emitting a sacred atmosphere,” said Inho as if the world tree was a big headache.<br/><br/>“Now we can’t hide it.”<br/><br/>“Nope. It has become the landmark of this area, so we can’t.”<br/><br/>Few people knew that the world tree was growing in Suwon.<br/><br/>When Terror Kim attacked the village, the world tree was exposed to the broadcast briefly, but at that time, it was still small, so no one noticed the existence of a “world tree”.<br/><br/>‘If we can’t hide it, it’s time for us to use it.’<br/><br/>Until now they have kept the existence of the world tree secret to preserve the young world tree.<br/><br/>However, now they have become strong enough to defend the world tree. Besides, they had the “Shade of the Godly Tree”, an invisible barrier on their own.<br/><br/>Then, how could they make use of this overwhelming presence they could not hide anymore?<br/><br/>‘Yeah, let me make it stand out.’<br/><br/>-Would you like to designate this place as the main base of the Third camp? (Y/N)<br/><br/>Sungwoo chose yes.<br/><br/>-Enter the camp name.<br/><br/>* Caution! You can’t change it for 30 days.<br/><br/>* Caution! It takes a huge amount of gold for you to change it.<br/><br/>Deciding the name of the camp was a really difficult problem. But Sungwoo didn’t want to worry about such a headache. That’s why he didn’t change his nickname in the community.<br/><br/>In particular, coining the name of the organization, not the individual’s nickname, was inevitably tricky because it should reflect the personality and values of the group.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Finally, Sungwoo slowly opened his mouth. For fear he might pronounce it wrong, he spoke clearly.<br/><br/>“World Tree.”<br/><br/>Devil and Angel, these names were simple but very intense in terms of their images.<br/><br/>In other words, their names signified something very impressive.<br/><br/>Then, which ‘keyword’ would be impressive enough to impart a strong image like the two names?<br/><br/>Currently, Sungwoo has a strong brand name called ‘Necromancer’, but this name would be more useful as an individual’s name, for the power that this name carried would be weakened if it were mentioned at an important moment.<br/><br/>That’s why Sungwoo chose the name of the transcendent being, “World Tree”.<br/><br/>-Can you confirm it’s  camp? (Y/N)<br/><br/>“Yes, confirm.”<br/><br/>– Congratulations! You have created a new camp.<br/><br/>* Your camp has been classified as a regular camp.<br/><br/>* New features will be opened according to the camp level.<br/><br/>-You have successfully cleared the camp quest !<br/><br/>* Reward is given. (Initial operating fund)<br/><br/>-You are granted the title of the Camp Founder.<br/><br/>* All stats increase. (+3)<br/><br/>-You can add regular members to your camp.<br/><br/>* Check the ‘camp members’ menu.<br/><br/>-‘World Tree’ has become the symbol of your camp by satisfying the special conditions.<br/><br/>‘A symbol? Is it the same role as the statue?’<br/><br/>[World Message]<br/><br/>– Congratulations! , the first player-led camp on the Korean server, has been created.<br/><br/>The message about the creation of a new camp was delivered to all players within the invisible barrier.<br/><br/>“Wow!”<br/><br/>“Finally, we are also a regular camp!”<br/><br/>At first, they were in a tense mood because they were prepared for any contingency situation, but when the camp was established without any problems, they were soon in a festive mood.<br/><br/>“Devil camp? Angel camp? We don’t need them at all!”<br/><br/>“They are ill-bred without any legitimacy. Besides, we don’t know their leaders.”<br/><br/>“You bet. They are messed up.”<br/><br/>The villagers felt alienated and deprived when those belonging to the two camps dominated the community, so it was natural they were filled with emotion when they realized that the Necromancer surpassed both camps and became the best on the Korean server, and as a result, they witnessed the birth of a “regular camp.”<br/><br/>“Well, we may soon see the return of a world where we can lead a decent living as humans if things keep improving like this.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, it still sounds like a dream, but it’s not impossible as long as the Necromancer…”<br/><br/>“Right. I think it’s possible.”<br/><br/>But all things didn’t necessarily work out well.<br/><br/>[Angel’s camp Emergency Quest (World)]<br/><br/>-Title: Cleansing the Impure Seeds<br/><br/>-Goal: Disintegrate the “World Tree camp” and destroy their leader “kor-157”<br/><br/>-Target: No restrictions (contact ‘Angel Statue’ after carrying out your goal)<br/><br/>-Reward: 150 million gold and the title ‘Best of the Server’ is given.<br/><br/>[Demon camp Emergency Quest (World)]<br/><br/>-Title: Stepping on and bursting parasite eggs<br/><br/>-Goal: Offer the bodies of the “World Tree” camp players to the “Devil Statue”<br/><br/>-Target: No restrictions (contact the ‘Devil Statue’ after carrying out your goal)<br/><br/>-Reward: 1 million gold per player and the biggest contributor is given the title of ‘Best of the Server.’<br/><br/>‘They must have invested a lot.’<br/><br/>When the Third camp was created, the two Absolute Races were continuing to confront each other while they were on a roll without bothering other servers.<br/><br/>However, the Third camp was born only in the “Korean server”, beating the two Absolute Races and established itself as the best camp.<br/><br/>They must have felt a great sense of crisis because of the Third camp, so it was natural they showed such a radical reaction.<br/><br/>However, the next message was even more shocking.<br/><br/>[World Quest]<br/><br/>-Name: Those who are hated by the big world<br/><br/>-Type: Hunting or Protecting<br/><br/>-Goal: Hunt or protect the ‘World Tree’ camp players.<br/><br/>-Compensation: Differential payment depending on the situation<br/><br/>*”Kor-157,” the founder of the “World Tree camp,” was one of the world’s top players, who has continuously engaged in activities that enraged the two Absolute Races. So, they decided not to leave him alone. This event was supposed to take place on all servers throughout the world. You also have to choose whether you will obey the orders of the Absolute Race, or you will rebel against them and join the new camp.<br/><br/>* The current quest may change depending on its progress.<br/><br/>The system gave new quests because of the fierce reaction of the two camps, Angel and Demon. However, the system made the terrible decision to target the whole Korean server as the ‘quest target.’<br/><br/>“This is crazy! Sungwoo, don’t you think this is too much? How can they grant such a huge amount of gold per player? Crazy bastards! ”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Because of the shocking message that appeared before all the village players, the festive atmosphere among them was gone in an instant. They were so gloomy and frustrated.<br/><br/>“What the heck is all this…”<br/><br/>“Is this quest real?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not help but be embarrassed. Besides, they put a huge bounty on his head, which was enough to attract players around the world to this quest.<br/><br/>‘Honestly, it’s an opportunity that any big server nearby will never give up.’<br/><br/>On the other hand, it was like a death sentence for the World Tree camp, which was just established.<br/><br/>However, the villagers’ reaction was unexpected.<br/><br/>“What the heck? Are they hunting us?”<br/><br/>“Damn it, they are talking bullshit.”<br/><br/>“For some reason, I think I can gain more EXP and gold rings this time.”<br/><br/>“Me, too. I think I have to dig more herbs from the mountain and fill the potion storehouse.”<br/><br/>They were not scared or overwhelmed at all. The players of the village, namely the players of the World Tree camp, already became strong enough to confront any external players.<br/><br/>So much so they were full of determination to brave the crisis and turn it into their opportunity. Their courage and guts were what Sungwoo defined as the evidence of their real worth.<br/><br/>“Hanho, and Kyungsoo, Inho!”<br/><br/>“Yep!”<br/><br/>“Yes, sir!”<br/><br/>“Here I am!”<br/><br/>Kyungsoo and Inho approached him immediately.<br/><br/>“I think we have to be ready to fight in a big way this time.”<br/><br/>Although Sungwoo said it seriously, they didn’t get cold feet at all.<br/><br/>“Sure, no problem.”<br/><br/>“I thought a day like this would come.”<br/><br/>“Well, I’m always ready to play a supporting role behind you! Yeah, the spirit of sacrifice!”<br/><br/>They were already fully ready now.<br/><br/>“Good. Let’s get ready!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded and quietly pulled out the “Imoogi Scales”.<br/><br/>-ON AIR (!)<br/><br/>‘They just can’t take their eyes off me…’<br/><br/>Regardless of who the “creator” that Imoogi mentioned and their plan, Sungwoo intended to crush them in a way they never expected. </div><h2 id="chapter214">Chapter 214</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Hanho felt the world quest this time was very unfair.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, when I think about the current world quest more and more, I think it’s unfair. Don’t you think so?”<br/><br/>“Why?”<br/><br/>“How come the system makes not only Korea but the whole world our enemy? Don’t you think the system is very mean to us?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was touching the scales of the Imoogi in his pocket.<br/><br/>-ON AIR (!)<br/><br/>Was it because the world’s attention was focused on one place? Those unidentified figures watching Sungwoo closely didn’t disappear.<br/><br/>“They won’t dare attack us recklessly.”<br/><br/>“Why?”<br/><br/>Although the bounty for kor-157 had been increased worldwide, it was the first time the same quest was issued on all servers.<br/><br/>In other words, after the world turned into a game, the biggest event was triggered with the start of the world quest. So, what would those foreign players who don’t know the situation of the Korean server think about the “World Tree Camp”?<br/><br/>“Foreign server players who have only heard about us through the system messages will have no choice but to regard us as supernatural forces at least for the time being…”<br/><br/>Weren’t Sungwoo, or the Necromancer’s forces confronting the Absolute Race bravely? So, even the foreign players could not think the Necromancer’s team was an easy target.<br/><br/>“Aha? They must be scared of us, right?”<br/><br/>“Of course, they should be. Their perception of us will make them hesitate. So, while they are undecided, we have to thoroughly prepare for their attack. This could escalate into a world war…”<br/><br/>“World war? Are you serious?”<br/><br/>Foreign players would not be able to attack the Third camp led by Sungwoo recklessly, but they would start investigating Sungwoo sooner or later. After that, quite a few of them would eventually take the risk of attacking the Korean server.<br/><br/>Since they misunderstood Sungwoo’s forces as supernatural, they would ally a joint attack.<br/><br/>‘They will come to attack us on a large-scale expedition.’<br/><br/>It was not an exaggeration that Sungwoo said they should prepare for a world war.<br/><br/>“By the way, if I check our server community, there aren’t any guys who are trying to pick a fight with us. As you know, there were so many trying to argue with each other about this kind of fight. Where are all of them now?”<br/><br/>“I think they are watching our movement in secret.”<br/><br/>On the other hand, there was no movement at all to overthrow the Necromancer on the Korean server, which was very strange.”<br/><br/>“They are watching us in hiding? Oh, they are keeping quiet because they have watched us beat our opponents so severely several times? Maybe…”<br/><br/>Since they have already witnessed the results of the Necromancer’s fight with his opponents several times, they must have realized that they could gain much more by maintaining a good relationship with him rather than being hostile to him.<br/><br/>In particular, this was a very sensitive issue for the groups belonging to the “Demon camp” who had once been eliminated by the Necromancer.<br/><br/>-[LIVE] The official position of the ‘Hwarang Guild’ of the Demon camp about the World Quest (19,555 viewers currently watching)<br/><br/>“The demon camp in Busan, led by our “Hwarang Guild,” avoids extreme confrontation.

For this…”<br/><br/>The “Hwarang Guild,” regarded as the strongest force in the southern part of the Korean peninsula, began to appease the Necromancer team.<br/><br/>They were conscious of the possible confrontation with the Necromancer when they were mentioned as the next opponent of the Necromancer in the community.<br/><br/>Other forces followed suit.<br/><br/>[694] An independent group in Cheongju supports the World Tree camp.<br/><br/>-Author: Cheongju signboard │ Hit: 21,456<br/><br/>[697] Chuncheon 188 people group would like to join the World Tree camp.<br/><br/>-Author: LEE Sangtae │ Inquiry: 19,541<br/><br/>[702] It’s a demon camp, but it’s a necromancer.<br/><br/>-Author: Paju’s daughter │ Hits: 11,986<br/><br/>Not only those forces that have not yet belonged to any camp, as well as those who already belonged to the existing camps support and hope to join the “World Tree camp” in a dramatic show of the World Tree camp’s strong presence on the Korean server.<br/><br/>[715] Haven’t you guys seen this situation before?<br/><br/>-Author: Kimchi master │ Hit: 41,443<br/><br/>As for the World Quest, don’t you think we’re in the same situation back in 19th century-old Korea when the royal government attracted foreign forces because the government troops failed to block the native farmers’ militia’s uprising?

We have to join forces to stop them, regardless of whether we are on the side of the Demon camp or the Angel camp.<br/><br/>Now it has become an undeniable fact that the World Tree camp has emerged as the representative of the Korean server in terms of their power and public opinion.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>At that time, a large “bulk carrier” was floating off the coast near Tsushima of the Japanese server.<br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/>Soon, a helicopter flew from the sea of the Korean server and landed in an empty place in the cargo department of the bulk carrier at the signal of its crew.<br/><br/>The man who got off the helicopter was pomade-haired. He shook hands with the man in a white suit who was waiting for him.<br/><br/>“Hello, Mr. Arahata!”<br/><br/>“Dr. Yu, welcome. This is my first time seeing you like this.”<br/><br/>The two had different nationalities and spoke different languages, but the system broke such barriers and made their business possible.<br/><br/>“Did your leader come directly to the sea?”<br/><br/>When Dr. Yu asked, Arahata shook his head.<br/><br/>“Dr. Yu, Kumicho does not move directly to such remote areas like this. Thank you for your generous understanding.”<br/><br/>“I see. If you don’t mind, can you tell me who I’m supposed to see instead of Kumicho?”<br/><br/>“The one who arranged this meeting is Okata Akira “Honbucho”, who is educating the guild’s daggers.”<br/><br/>Having said that, Arahata opened the door of the compartment to the inside of the ship.<br/><br/>The narrow corridor leading to the cabin was lined with ugly gang members.<br/><br/>Dr. Yu knew that they were lined up there to break the spirits of an uncomfortable guest, but Dr. Yu continued without paying any attention to them.<br/><br/>“Oh, I have heard of his name. He is the swordmaster, right?”<br/><br/>“Yes, he has been called like that for a long time.”<br/><br/>They walked through the corridor and carefully opened the captain’s door.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, it was renovated into a guest room with Japanese floor mats. Given that it was more spacious than he thought, it seemed like the walls of a few rooms were broken open to make space for the guest room.<br/><br/>A sharp-looking man at the head table stood up when they entered.<br/><br/>He was the swordmaster boasting of perfect sword skills.<br/><br/>-His keen sensation sees through your identity.<br/><br/>* Part of your information is exposed.<br/><br/>* Your movement is being read.<br/><br/>His eyes were not human. They were close to the eyes of a bird of prey with the pupil torn vertically. His eyes moved fast and scanned Dr. Yu’s hands, neck, and eyes in turn.<br/><br/>Only then did he open his mouth.<br/><br/>“Dr. Yu, thank you for coming to this place in person.”<br/><br/>“You’re welcome. It is an honor to meet you, swordmaster. And I’m glad I can stand behind that hilt.”<br/><br/>Akira smiled with satisfaction at Dr. Yu’s response.<br/><br/>“Hahaha! I’m surprised you know my nickname that they on the Japanese server call me jokingly. I think your intelligence capabilities are great.”<br/><br/>The two shook hands and sat.<br/><br/>Soon, as if it were a really important business, a dining table was prepared for them formally.<br/><br/>It wasn’t until after they exchanged a few more pleasantries they formally started to talk about their secret business.<br/><br/>“So, what you mean is that the target that you and the Evolution Society requested us to kill is that guy picked by the World Quest yesterday, right?”<br/><br/>“Yes, he is the Necromancer.”<br/><br/>Raising the teacup, Akira fell into a long agony.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>He fixed his eyes on the Ukiyoe-style painting on the wall behind Dr. Yu.<br/><br/>‘Isn’t this guy kor-157 of the World Tree Camp? Players here are already clamoring to get rid of him. If we get tipped by our informant on the Korean server and get rid of him first, this is a jackpot! Wow, we’ve trapped a big shot.’<br/><br/>After some time, he put the teacup down and said, “I’ve been thinking about it for a long time. Since Kumicho has let me decide on that, let me dispatch my favorite commodore. So, you don’t have to worry, Dr. Yu.” </div><h2 id="chapter215">Chapter 215</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Dr. Yu said, “As I already told you, we have already commissioned the mercenaries of the Korean server, but they failed miserably. So, I think our target must be preparing for our attack to some extent.”<br/><br/>Having heard that, Akira closed his eyes half-way, and said sharply, “Dr. Yu, I hope you don’t treat us as mercenaries. We’re swordsmen fighting for honor and loyalty, so we’re different from the tricksters who are fighting for pennies.”<br/><br/>“Sure, I know that. I’m not ignoring the swordsmen of the Yamato guild, but you will learn that the Necromancer is a tough opponent.”<br/><br/>Akira expressed some displeasure.<br/><br/>“Please don’t worry. We have been trained to easily kill strong opponents. That’s the essence of ninjas.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, I know very well about ninjas.”<br/><br/>“I would like to emphasize that it is not easy to create synergy by gathering 15 ninja players even within the Japanese server.”<br/><br/>There was a powerful synergy that could be obtained only when ninjas gathered. And they were supposed to be dispatched to assassinate the Korean server’s most powerful man, the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“Alright. We’re going to turn the ship…”<br/><br/>Dr. Yu stood at Akira’s words. They were done concluding a deal.<br/><br/>“It was an honor to meet you.”<br/><br/>The moment Dr. Yu turned around, Akira urgently added, “Oh, Dr. Yu, we received an order from Honbucho that our ninjas should not draw their swords until after we receive the item.”<br/><br/>“Got it. We’ll send it to you by the end of today.”<br/><br/>After the conversation, Dr. Yu got out of the cabin and got on the helicopter. Next to him, a young woman held out a pair of headphones. He put them on and sent a hand signal to take off.<br/><br/>Woooooong-<br/><br/>“Dr. Yu, who the hell is Kumicho? Who is that person?”<br/><br/>Agents aboard the helicopter were listening to his conversation with his Japanese counterparts through wiretapping devices. They were on standby to rescue him in an emergency.<br/><br/>“Well, he’s the leader of the Yamato Guild that has taken control of Kyushu, but he’s an old man who couldn’t even awaken at level 22. So, he is raking in items needed for awakening. We had one, so we could strike a deal.”<br/><br/>The woman nodded, then looked in the direction of Korea this time.<br/><br/>“Will they be different this time? Can ninja kill the Necromancer?”<br/><br/>“Well, if they can only buy time for us, that’s fine. Even if the Yamato guild fails, we will have no problem as long as we can carry out our plan successfully…”<br/><br/>“Yeah, the Necromancer is finished.”<br/><br/>“Yep.”<br/><br/>Not everyone on the Korean server was scared of the Necromancer. After they fully admitted his strength, they were preparing a fatal attack against him.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>In a perished world, how will the world war unfold under the rules of the system? And how should they prepare for it? The players of the World Tree camp agonized over it deeply.<br/><br/>“Well, we are numerically so small that we can hardly wage a war.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, I guess so.”<br/><br/>Until now, they have purposely pursued a small number of elite forces because they wanted to reduce the risk caused by unnecessary dependents and to lay a solid foundation. Their goal was a success.<br/><br/>“Fortunately, few people have died until now, but I can’t guarantee that in the future.”<br/><br/>When it comes to a full-fledged war, it’s a different story. If the war escalates into a multi-facet war that Sungwoo alone can’t deal with, the villager players would also be involved in a bloody battle. In such a situation, it would be inevitable there would be casualties.<br/><br/>That was the real problem. The village’s population was only 226, so even if a small number of them were killed, it would be an irrecoverable blow to them.<br/><br/>“However, it is a big headache to increase the players indiscriminately,” Kyongsu said.<br/><br/>Inho nodded at him and said, “I agree. I think we need to establish a procedure to accept new players.”<br/><br/>“I am on the same page with you,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Sungwoo felt that what they could do immediately was to raise the level of the existing players to the highest possible.<br/><br/>It would not be too late to increase the number of the players later because if they could secure a solid foundation first, the players who joined them later could grow faster than expected.<br/><br/>“Then, let’s focus on how to draw up the best defense plan. First of all, I think my undead army will be able to play the role of defending the enemies’ attack at the forefront.”<br/><br/>At least one hour after the war, they won’t have to worry about a strong defense because large undead under Sungwoo’s control would resurrect indefinitely and defend the front line.<br/><br/>“But the problem is we are always weak at defending against the enemies’ ranged attack.”<br/><br/>In particular, since the undead themselves were not intelligent, it was quite hard for them to operate the subordinate spirits of the ‘wizard’ series that required a high level of intelligence.<br/><br/>Of course, they could use some basic attack magic like “Kovolt Wizard”, but that didn’t help much. They needed advanced magic that granted ranged magic and abnormal status.<br/><br/>“By the way, there are lots of archers among the villagers. How about forming an archer unit first?” Inho suggested.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo released the items he obtained from the Battle of Mt. Pukhan.<br/><br/>Among them, the most useful was the “Multiple Arrow” item used by the “Skoll Unit”, the main force of the Reconstruction Alliance.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Highest-grade Multiple Arrow<br/><br/>-Grade: Rare<br/><br/>-Category: Crossbow<br/><br/>-Effect: Semi-automatic device is attached to it. You can fire eight arrows in succession when you trigger it.<br/><br/>“Oh, this is terrific! It certainly has better firepower than normal arrows or crossbows. Even if the single-shot damage is weak, firing it like rain would be more effective in a large-scale battle.”<br/><br/>“But how about showing it to our Kongdori players? Even if we give them iron pipes, they can make a blue dragon sword.”<br/><br/>Kongdori was a nickname for those players in the manufacturing sector. Since they received the buffs of the ‘Abundance of Godly Tree’, they have been producing quality items thanks to their upgrade skill level.<br/><br/>A little later, the two blacksmiths checked the item and began to exchange conversations with each other.<br/><br/>“How about attaching the spirit stone you got? I think it will be more powerful with the added effect.”<br/><br/>“No, I don’t think so. This item has been specialized for rapid-fire, so it would be better to maximize it. Let’s attach a dwarf box as we have lots of them.”<br/><br/>“That would be better.”<br/><br/>Then, they put one ‘highest quality multiple arrows’ on the workbench and started renovating it.<br/><br/>Within a few minutes, they created a new item.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Highest-grade Multiple Arrow (large-capacity magazine)<br/><br/>-Grade: Rare<br/><br/>-Category: Crossbow<br/><br/>-Effect: A semi-automatic device is attached to it. Also, a large-capacity magazine has been added. You can fire 28 rounds in a row when you trigger it.<br/><br/>The number of arrows that can be fired with a single load has increased significantly from 8 to 28. In terms of reducing the reload time, the rate of fire per minute has been significantly increased.<br/><br/>“But it cost 90,000 gold to renovate this one. I think it will take quite a bit of gold to renovate 25 of them.”<br/><br/>Although the blacksmith expressed satisfaction, he looked somewhat worried because 90,000 gold was a lot of money.<br/><br/>But they could stop worrying after hearing Sungwoo’s reassurances.<br/><br/>“Don’t worry about the cost. I’ll support you as much as you can.”<br/><br/>“Wow, our Kondori players would welcome it with open hands!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s wealth kept growing. Not only did he win 300 million gold with one bet, but everyone in the World Tree camp also took a huge profit by betting.<br/><br/>Perhaps the World Tree camp was the most wealthy group on the entire Korean server.<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought of creating an elite group that could be a match for a group with enormous capital and buffs.<br/><br/>Just like the Necromancer could deal with hundreds or thousands of enemy troops, they could turn into a mighty force if each of them could deal with ten enemies.<br/><br/>“But just because the items are good, you won’t be strong automatically.”<br/><br/>“We have to hunt again to be strong, right?”<br/><br/>Items were a very important factor, but they showed different effects, depending on who used them.<br/><br/>Currently, the players in the World Tree’s camp had above-average levels and combat abilities. However, they had yet to reach the level of an individual who could deal with ten enemies, which was Sungwoo’s goal.<br/><br/>“Kyongsu, could you summarize a list of dungeons and give it to me?”<br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/>Then, Inho began to explain, “The field is always tidy and clean, and there are simply too many dungeons. You can choose whatever you want.”<br/><br/>“Are the dungeons large?”<br/><br/>“Yes. At the beginning of this chapter, there were about 4 in downtown Suwon. We sometimes visited there, but we haven’t yet attacked them because they are so large.”<br/><br/>The large-scale dungeon was one of the main contents of this chapter.<br/><br/>“Good. Inho, please divide the players into a group to launch an attack on the dungeons. They are going to attack the dungeons with me.”<br/><br/>Inho looked astonished.<br/><br/>“Are you going to guide them in person?”<br/><br/>“Guide? Well, I’m going with them, but I just hope they can endure the fight as best as they can.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s goal was to make each of the village players strong enough to deal with ten enemies. So their hellish training began with the Necromancer. </div><h2 id="chapter216">Chapter 216</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A well-organized party was marching into the narrow crypt. There were a total of 25 players from the World Tree camp. At a glance, they seemed exhausted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haa…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everyone, hold out a little more. You will arrive at a turning point.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were undergoing hard training to become an elite group, and it was not easy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was true that they raised their levels through active hunting even while Sungwoo was away, but none of them had experience in attacking the dungeon of the highest difficulty level.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Something is charging at us!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ooooooh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They’re trolls! Four trolls are attacking us!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t panic! With our current level, we can hunt them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- thump- thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, these players were not an undisciplined group. Even if large monsters attacked them, the players quickly recovered their composure and began to focus on their assigned roles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Tanker, advance!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Cast protection magic on the shield!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tankers were ready to hold out after blocking the narrow street corner. Then, the wizards in the rear swung their wands and prepared magic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Muscle Paralysis!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Heavy Legs!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shield Breaker!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After weakening a group of trolls by casting the magic of an abnormal state, ranged dealers spammed tremendous firepower.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shunnnnnnng! Shunnnnnnnng!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When dozens of arrows hit the trolls’ legs, they began to collapse one by one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good job! Charge!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kill them all!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players made a frontal attack on the trolls. Since the troll race’s resilience was very high, they should not give the trolls any chance to recover. So, the players had to run straight and stab their vital spots. The players started to kill the trolls without any hesitation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A terrifying noise resonated through the crypt.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 3,100 gold by hunting ‘underground trolls’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 4,550 gold by hunting ‘underground trolls’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 3,650 gold by hunting ‘underground trolls’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 13,500 gold by hunting ‘Underground Troll Watcher’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monsters were strong enough to give any player who hunted them 60,000 gold, so as a well-trained party, the 25 players could hunt them without any difficulty.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, if the players were caught off guard, their shield wall could collapse in the blink of an eye, and the wizards and archers with weak defense could be slaughtered. Fortunately, no such accident had occurred yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whew! We have finished! The entrance to the second floor is over there! That’s the turnaround point.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everybody, good job. Looks like you guys finished much faster than before.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players were accumulating combat experience by attacking only the first basement level of the large-scale dungeon in the “Troll’s Crypt” in the nearby “West Lake Park.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a dungeon consisting of three floors, and the first floor was a relatively safe area, so there were no casualties yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, they have been attacking in the predetermined order for eleven hours now, so they were almost exhausted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I want to take a rest.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I feel like I want to vomit because I have not been able to rest for two hours while attacking the troll monsters.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since they attacked the monsters faster and faster, their break time was drastically reduced because they had to prepare for the next attack as soon as they were done.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It’s hell.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Too tough. I regret saying I would work hard.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Therefore, as time passed by, they were facing their limits of exhaustion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Some even had nosebleeds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Exhausted by the endless hard training, All of the players wanted to give up right away, but they refreshed their determination.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Well, I really can’t say I will give up.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After they cleared the trolls’ corpses and their equipment, they checked the Necromancer’s expression, who was standing behind them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After looking at the traces of their fighting, the Necromancer turned around without saying anything.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the skeletons waiting in the rear came running and carried the bodies of underground trolls, and started to get out of the dungeon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It meant the end of their offensive against the trolls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, the Necromancer’s action means we did a good job, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t you think we still have a long way to go?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, I have no idea…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players could hardly figure out the Necromancer’s reaction, but they could fight more actively because he was standing behind them. They knew he would come to their rescue in an emergency.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, they knew that hard training was the fastest and safest way for them to grow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, the next group was on standby at the entrance of the ‘Troll’s Crypt’ dungeon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were still exhausted because of a short break, but they had no choice but to get ready to attack the dungeon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hah, I’m so tired…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If I repeat this attack exercise two more times, I might die. I think I am fighting while dozing off. Hey guys, please come out a little later!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the entrance to the dungeon lit up against their wishes. It meant their previous group’s dungeon attack was finished, so the next group should be ready to go in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? Did they already finish and come out? They went in a short time ago, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, they are so fast!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Group 3, who entered the dungeon earlier, began to come out. All of the players were already exhausted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Group 3, you guys finished in 15 minutes and 34 seconds.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! We shortened our attack by four minutes, compared with our last attack. Awesome!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although Group 3 completed the attack when they were at the end of their tether, they were soon elated at the better results than expected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“15 minutes? Well, it seems that I’m fighting more confidently with more fighting experiences. Before I knew it, I used skills automatically.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Right. This time, it seems that none of my arrows or magic missed the target. Yeah, I think my fighting has improved through this hard training several times.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>All the players felt they were growing every moment. They even felt they were stronger than they were only two hours ago. So, it’s no wonder they felt a great sense of achievement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They extracted skin and blood from the bodies of the “underground trolls.” As a result, they were piling up a lot of materials for future wars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? They’re coming in again!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A huge shadow cast over the sky in the Suwon village. It was Sungwoo’s Bone Wyvern.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When a total of three Wyverns landed in the vacant lot, the players in the field of living and production started to get busy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? They came here so fast! We haven’t even processed all the materials we received last time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Aren’t the players attacking the dungeon more and more crazy? They are supposed to get more and more tired as time passes, but how can they speed up their attack?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players here specialized in their field through a division of labor, so they dismantled the materials and produced items in an organized way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They could just stack up the materials and produce them slowly, but it seemed like they were also training for a total war that might break out someday.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“All the boxes are full. Bring extra boxes!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There are already over 60 boxes of recovery potions.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crazy! It’s like we’re working in a drink company?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Troll’s Blood’ had excellent self-regeneration properties and was good material for recovery potions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even if the players take it raw, they could expect the healing of their wounds. So, they were reborn as a much more effective item through processing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn trolls! Their skin is too tough, my wrist hurts so much. I heard that Mr. Kim, the tanner, used to work at the Pyeonghwa market. He says it’s tougher to work here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, try to trim even more leather instead of chatting like that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The leather of the monster was perfect as an armor material. The tanners and blacksmiths joined hands to produce better than average defense items.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Also, those in a cooking position were cooking many foods that had a buff effect and distributing them to those in need.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It’s been 13 hours since they started attacking the dungeon when they had a brief break.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Kyongsu came and reported to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our players’ average level is over 11. More precisely, it’s 11.6, so rounding it up will be 12.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The average level of 226 players was a whopping 11.6. Excluding children who couldn’t fight yet and players in the field of living and production, their average level would be higher.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Moreover, even the elderly, who were often treated as a nuisance in most survivor groups, also played their role well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you sure your level is 13, sir? Oh my god! Weren’t you level 7 until recently?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahaha. I think I can fight well when I reminisce about my fighting days during the Vietnamese War.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Some seniors recovered their health when they leveled up, so they were now strong enough to fight with young players. </div><h2 id="chapter217">Chapter 217</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Kyongsu carefully checked the conditions of the village players and distributed the items to the right places.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He said, “We have supplied them with new equipment items. I’m sure they have become much stronger than before.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were leveling up in real-time, but the speed of their level-up was gradually slowing. It meant the time came for them to change the hunting ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, we are going to start attacking the second floor from now on. After each group makes a couple of rounds once more, all of our troops will go up to the boss room.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo said that, the players’ faces turned pale then hardened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s start over.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their hellish training continued.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that time, the “Taebaek Investigation Team” of the Wide Area Surveillance Team of the Liberation Guild was searching all over Mt. Taebaek, focusing their search around Mt. Seorak. As they promised the Necromancer, they were searching for the missing person named Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first, they planned to fly a magic drone to scan the mountains for her at a glance. No matter how big and wide the mountains were, they could check it out quickly by looking down from the sky,<br/><br/><br/><br/>But things didn’t work out as they wished.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Lower magic’ is blocked by an ‘unknown power’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They could not know the exact cause, but it was certain that something strange was happening in the deep mountains where humans had never trodden.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We can’t help it. We have to bring more guys to search for her deep into the mountains.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the end, they had no choice but to do some legwork.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the mountains were too wide and steep. Besides, there were dreadful monsters under the control of the “King of the Great Mountain” in the deep mountains.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh, shit…I now know why the Struggle Guild gave up and decided to join hands with other camps. Yeah, they were not crazy guys. They are very rational.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You’re right. All the monsters here are very weird. It looks like each of them is a boss monster.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Struggle Guild had been a powerful force, but they could not beat the King of the Great Mountain. In the end, they had to leave Mt. Taebek.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though the Wide Area Surveillance team’s intelligence agents, who specialized in concealment and stealth, focused only on the search for Jisu while avoiding the monsters, they still faced several dangerous moments. For example, all five members of the “2nd Search Team ” were annihilated during the operation, which showed how powerful the monsters were.<br/><br/><br/><br/>These monsters were fundamentally different from the monsters of before who tried to beat back their opponents by outnumbering them. Most of the monsters here had their skills, and some of them cast powerful magic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Also, they moved intelligently when they aimed for their prey, so once they started to chase, it was best to widen the distance between them and hide in a safe area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If that happened, it meant their search efforts failed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Surviving alone in a place like this? Is that possible? Don’t you think this is futile?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was natural they felt skeptical about their search efforts in such a situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haven’t you seen that woman fighting? She is not a human. Who knows? She might be already controlling this area.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But this place is too dangerous. It’s not a matter of a temporary win, but she has to stay and hold out here in this place teeming with the monsters. She is in a different situation where we only search during the day and escape into the safe zone.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, you’re right.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they thought as far as that, they began to feel anxious.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What would the Necromancer say if you found her body and give it to him?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s scary even to hear that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They searched for her for long hours, but they could not find any traces.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, the search team began to think about giving up the search effort and withdrawing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And when they made the last search effort, one of its members shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ve found evidence of her! It’s her footsteps!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisoo proved she survived on this hellish mountain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the search camp installed at the Osaek Bus Terminal in the valley of Mt. Taebek,<br/><br/><br/><br/>the leader of the 1st Search Team reported, “We found her traces at an elevation of 980 meters on the northwest ridge.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The head of the search team, who was only sighing while looking at the map all day long, opened his eyes wide and corrected his posture.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he nodded, the team leader continued, “We found a large number of monster corpses, but they seemed to have clashed with an extraordinarily strong man. I think it’s the woman we have been searching for. And we have a witness who can decisively testify about her whereabouts.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Witness?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The only thing they could get from the monsters’ corpses was sword wounds, but it was a different story if they found a witness. The witness might have had a conversation with Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The witnesses are an old man and his granddaughters living in the mountains. It looks like they were with the missing person briefly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That means they are not together now, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nope.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! So? Did he hear anything? Huh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the search leader demanded, the team leader nodded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“According to the old man, the woman must have received some kind of quest. And the quest seems to be related to the “King of the Great Mountain”, so I think she might have followed the path of the quest.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way! It’s hard to believe she was chasing the monster king…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wasn’t it the quest that even the Struggle Guild, composed of hundreds of men, gave up? No matter how skillful she was in wielding the sword, she couldn’t deal with the monster king.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, there is something I can’t understand.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“According to the old man’s granddaughter, the woman murmured something like, ‘The King of the Great Mountain had the last item of the King of Shadow’, but I don’t know what she was talking about.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The search leader frowned and said. “What the heck is the King of Shadow? Are there two kings here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I have no idea. There is no mention of that in our intelligence report. I’ve never heard it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The King of Shadow was new to them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If a woman is chasing the King of the Great Mountain, it is unreasonable for us to search for her further. We are not here for a suicide mission, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the search camp leader didn’t believe she went after the monster king alone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If so, where did she go?<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>It is very important to prepare for a war and there are many ways of preparing for it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Generally speaking, they can beef up power through training and stockpiling like the World Tree camp. On the other hand, they can inflict damage on the hostile forces through operation and intelligence. By damaging the opponent’s firepower, they can widen the power gap.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This method is quite difficult, but it is excellent in terms of cost-saving. That’s why this method requires those ‘agents’ who are thoroughly trained.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can I ask you for directions?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sangnok-gu in Ansan City was once a busy area, but after the world turned into a game, it was dreadful to meet somebody in this barren city, like this man in black who asked for directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seungtae, the man who was asked for directions, was embarrassed, but he did not let down his guard. Of course, he was not that nervous at the moment because he encountered only two people on the street.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey Seungtae, what’s going on?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seungtae looked back as if he was dumbfounded. There were three trucks pulled over on the street, and 26 were on the bus. They were staring at the two men sternly who blocked their way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since they fIew a magic drone just in preparation for an unknown ambush, they judged they could win easily if an armed conflict occurred.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I don’t know. They seem to be lost,” Seungtae said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Because we are busy, tell them to call 112. The police will show them the directions.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They burst into laughter at that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wait a minute.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Emboldened by his colleagues’ backing, Seungtae openly expressed displeasure.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Directions? Which direction are you talking about?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can I go to Suwon if I walk in this direction?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seungtae slowly lifted his finger and pointed to the green sign on the roadside.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The sign showed the distances to nearby metropolitan cities such as Seoul and Suwon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, the man didn’t have to ask Seungtae about the directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man’s eyes slowly followed Seungtae’s fingers, and soon stopped at the sign.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, there was no change in his facial expression. Even his pupils didn’t move as if he didn’t know how to read.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He opened his mouth again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, you mean Suwon is in this direction?” </div><h2 id="chapter218">Chapter 218</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>At last, Seungtae began to get annoyed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He snapped sharply, “Hey, don’t you see the road sign over there? I don’t think you don’t know how to read, but if you want to try to trick me, let me warn you…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, good. By the way…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man stopped talking, then approached Seungtae.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sensing some sort of threat, Seungtae took a step back and raised his right hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, be careful, man! Don’t approach me anymore.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If Seungtae put down this hand, his colleagues behind him would begin to charge at the two strange men and knock them down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, hey, calm down. What I’m looking for isn’t a road sign… And I’m not interested in those strange-looking characters, you idiot!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a moment of silence at his words.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck did you say? You are now…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How stupid, you Korean bastards! How come you can’t grasp a situation like this? You make me scoff at you, man,”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Seungtae scorned his opponent’s provocative remarks then turned to his colleagues.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Guys, what the heck did this bastard babble at me? Uh? Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Seungtae was immediately pushed down by the man, forcibly squatting over him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Clear.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seungtae doubted his eyes. The three trucks carrying his group were covered with blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The body parts whose limbs were cut off were strewn all over the place, and there was a pool of blood dripping under the truck. And those dressed in black were wiping blood from their swords.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No sound was heard, nor did anybody approach, fight, or even scream. What the hell is going on?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seungtae lay with his face down, trying to figure out the situation. His action was a survival instinct.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I’ll guide you, sir! Please save my life!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man squatted in front of Seungtae and replied, “In fact, it’s not the guide we need.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seungtae looked up at him and said, “Well, then…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Information! I want to keep getting information about someone from you, your cell phone, and the Korean server community.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, Korean bastard, I think you are really lucky. Our swordsmen from the 1st Team have drawn their swords, but you have been saved. This is unprecedented!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ikufumi, don’t talk bullshit like that! What if he gets scared and forgets the letters?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahaha!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After laughing heartily, that man looked at Seungtae again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, did you understand? You get the information from the community and report it to us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, sir! Sure!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only players belonging to the server could use the community on their mobile phones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That meant he could save his life as long as they needed him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So Seungtae got emboldened enough to ask, “Oh, I see. But if you don’t mind, can I ask who you are?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A guy who seemed to be the leader said, wearing a mask, “We’re the teachers who are here to get rid of your rotten heads. So, take us to your leader, the Necromancer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Twenty-three hours after the so-called hellish training began, players from the World Tree camp arrived on the third floor of the “Troll’s Crypt” dungeon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the boss room.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wuuuuuuuuhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The six-armed troll, the boss monster “King of the Underworld,” roared wildly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The125 players standing in line were now facing only one enemy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>This monster, a whopping 15 meters tall, was holding ugly weapons of different shapes in his six arms. If they approached him a bit, dozens of them would be swept away by the monster’s windmill-like attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Inflict damage on his unfrozen frozen leg!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since his left leg was cast in the freezing magic right now, his threatening posture was further subdued.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Team 4, load the arrows!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Team 2, fire the arrows!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Team 3, fire the arrows!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the freezing state did not last long. The monster crushed the ice with tremendous force and narrowed the distance between them little by little.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Team 2, the freezing magic is ready!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Right now! Cast it on his right leg!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Team 2’s second freezing magic hit the target, the monster’s movement slowed down significantly. Then, the archer unit fired arrows at his left leg intensively, which was just freed from freezing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of arrows poured over his massive legs, maiming his knees and thighs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woooooooohh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the monster moved forward without bothering the arrows, and the ice stuck to his right leg began to fall off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Team 3, the freezing magic is ready!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Team 4, Ready!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As soon as his right leg becomes wobbly, fire the arrows at his left leg immediately.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players’ freezing magic continued constantly. A total of 5 teams could overcome the limits of the ‘reuse waiting time’ by preparing the magic in turn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Team 1, prepare the freezing magic again!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their attack against the boss monster was very systematic. Rather than using their skills randomly, they calculated the exact time to attack, so they could carry out the optimal offensive strategy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the boss monster pulled something out of his waist with his third left arm. It was a huge slingshot. Soon, his second left arm pulled a rock out of the leather pocket.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t just a slingshot, but a super large slingshot that could do big damage like a catapult.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That monster is pulling the slingshot! Team 5, cast defense magic!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the commanders noticed the monster’s move. As soon as he shouted to his team members, a “large-scale shield,” which they had cast in advance, was formed and covered the players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the monster fired huge rocks, they couldn’t penetrate the hemispherical shield and bounced off in all directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This time, aim at his left arm! Tie it up to stop his ranged attacks!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fire!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the huge cave, the 125 players in five teams moved systematically, besieged, disturbed, avoided the monster, and minimized the damage while effectively inflicting damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, his arms began to fall off one by one. It was strong evidence that he was dying.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That monster has slowed down considerably!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay, keep pushing!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since there were no overwhelmingly powerful players, it took a lot of time for them to kill the monster, but they finally succeeded in getting him to kneel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrr…<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 115,000 gold by hunting the boss monster ‘King of the Underworld’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The 125 players shouted for joy at once at the message that appeared before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! We have won!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Finally, we beat the boss monster!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re leveling up again!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their cheers filled the cave and rang out. Even without the help of the Necromancer, none of them were killed by the boss monster, which was a huge success.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The total number of gold they earned from this single battle was 3,500,000 gold, and 34 people leveled up at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m already level 14. Can you believe I’ve increased two levels in one day?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m level 13, two up in one day.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the moment when the power of the World Tree camp players jumped in real-time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That wasn’t all they obtained. There was more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Look here! There is something on the wall!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Someone has found something special. It was the deepest part of the cave, the dead end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s not just a wall. I think there is space inside.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Upon closer examination, it was a kind of door, but it wasn’t big enough for humans to use.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was just the size that the boss monster, “King of the Underworld”, could enter and exit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it seemed inaccessible to them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The door is protected by powerful magic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Only ‘imprinted beings’ can access the door.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Level 3 or higher ‘Unseal’ charm is required.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You need the skill of ‘Unlocking’ with a craftsman level or higher.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The door has been blocked with magic,” Inho said, touching the wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ve seen something like this twice. There seems to be no hint in the dungeon, and it seems that it is a hidden reward that can only be opened with individual skills. None of us has such abilities,” Inho said, smacking his lips as if he was disappointed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo said with a nod, “The open condition written in the description is a skill I’ve never seen before. I think we need people with a high-ranking bandit profession.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, Sungwoo pulled something out of his pocket.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But I know something.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What he took out was a ‘Universal Key’ item that he picked up from a secret shop some time ago. Although he didn’t know when he would use it, he purchased it anyway because he knew he would need it someday.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo walked toward the door without saying anything.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-There is a door in a locked state. It can be opened through the ‘Universal Key’ item. Would you like to use it? (Y/N)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The door opens. (large vault of the Underworld King)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The whole wall began to shake with the message. Then, there was a gloomy light, and the huge stone wall vibrated as dust poured down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, what was inside the vault came into his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Opening a treasure chest is always a gamble because there is no guarantee that there is enough treasure to reward one’s effort to find the box.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Gosh, are trolls collecting this kind of stuff?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Just amazing….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His gamble this time was a success. </div><h2 id="chapter219">Chapter 219</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>“A troll with six arms…What a unique taste! How come this guy was hiding something like this in this closet?”<br/><br/>After Sungwoo’s troops killed the boss monster, he found a treasure trove in a hidden space.<br/><br/>It was the size of a general auditorium, and there were a lot of various items piled up.<br/><br/>The most striking thing of them was a large-sized wagon located in the middle of them.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Singijon (Fire Arrow Rocket)<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: Weapon<br/><br/>-Effect: When mana is injected, it fires 40 projectiles at the same time and causes an explosion at the striking point. (Fires once every 5 minutes)<br/><br/>* ‘Required mana’ varies depending on the user’s skill level.<br/><br/>“Singijon…”<br/><br/>Of course, it was not the replica of the old Korean-style fire arrow rocket. But it was made of a harder material than wood, and the design was somewhat more refined. And it contained magical power.<br/><br/>“I think we obtained something useful with the war around the corner.”<br/><br/>Currently, the flying weapons that the World Tree camp possessed were the two Iron Maces of Lightning they captured from the Evolution Society and the Ballista they manufactured.<br/><br/>They knew the strength of the flying weapons well because they had already used the weapons several times, but they were not easy to manufacture because of their huge size and weight.<br/><br/>“Wow! 40 shots at a time and explosions at that? Sungwoo, this is a jackpot!”<br/><br/>Now, they obtained a much more effective flying weapon. It seemed that they could use it on a large-scale battlefield.<br/><br/>“But, it’s quite heavy, so I think it’s difficult to carry this weapon.”<br/><br/>Inho slightly pushed it, then shook his head. Although it had wheels, it seemed that anybody using it would use all his might to push it uphill in a narrow crypt.<br/><br/>Moreover, it was a problem to move it to the village. It would be easiest to transport it by air using the Bone Wyvern, but fixing it tightly, so that it wouldn’t fall was a big concern.<br/><br/>Sungwoo came up with a different method.<br/><br/>“Well, I’ve got something useful for things like this.”<br/><br/>-‘World Tree camp’s Vault’ has been activated.<br/><br/>It was the “camp skill” he received after winning the battle in Taiwan.<br/><br/>[Subspace Vault (World Tree camp)]<br/><br/>* Registered users with permission to use: 4<br/><br/>-Gold consumption per one: 100,000 gold<br/><br/>-Items in storage: 0<br/><br/>To put it simply, it was an ‘inventory’. It was a system where all items could be stored and retrieved in a different space regardless of their size.<br/><br/>-Would you like to keep the ‘Singijon (Fire Arrow Rocket)’ item?<br/><br/>* Basic cost (100,000 gold) + additional cost for a large item(50,000 gold) = 150,000 gold is consumed.<br/><br/>“Keep it there.”<br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo said that, the huge object in front of them disappeared in an instant.<br/><br/>“Wow!”<br/><br/>“This is a jackpot! Come to think of it, I wish we could have one each.”<br/><br/>“Come on, let’s check other items as well.”<br/><br/>All sorts of items were piled up like a mountain inside the troll’s vault. It seemed that it would take a considerable time to check all the items.<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is this? Is it the staff used by the troll wizard?”<br/><br/>Hanho, who was wandering around, found an incredibly long wooden staff.<br/><br/>Inho, who was next to him, looked closely at it and opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“Isn’t it like a pole?”<br/><br/>“Pole? What is that?”<br/><br/>“You know that old Korean totem pole. They used to hang something like a bird at the top of the pole.”<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Lucky Pole<br/><br/>-Class: Hero<br/><br/>-Category: Totem<br/><br/>-Effect: All productivity and production technology in the nearby area (5km) where the pole has been installed increase (+10%) Also, all success chances increase. (+10%)<br/><br/>“Haha, our production players will be quite happy about this pole!”<br/><br/>Players in the living and production fields were growing fast every day, so the addition of this pole seemed to give them additional buffs.<br/><br/>After checking other items, Sungwoo and his party also found several ‘rare’ grade items, so they could further upgrade their equipment level.<br/><br/>Besides, they also found all kinds of material items and other items in large quantities, commonly referred to as ‘miscellaneous items.’<br/><br/>“I can’t check them one by one now, but if we examine them closely later, I think we can find lots of useful items.”<br/><br/>“Good. Let’s go back to our base first.”<br/><br/>Players from the World Tree camp returned to the village after collecting all the items in the dungeon.<br/><br/>Although it was a long hard and tough day, they significantly leveled up and obtained a huge amount of gold and a lot of other items.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The ‘Lucky Pole’ was installed at the entrance of the plaza where the world tree was standing. When it was installed upright on the ground, its effect was shown.<br/><br/>-The effect of the ‘Lucky Pole’ has been applied to the entire area.<br/><br/>* All productivity and production skills improve. (+10%)<br/><br/>* All chances of success increase. (+10%)<br/><br/>The buffs granted by the world tree were also being applied.<br/><br/>-‘Abundance of the Godly Tree’ has been granted to the whole area.<br/><br/>* Item production success rate increases. (+50%)<br/><br/>* Increases the probability of additional options when making items. (+10%)<br/><br/>* Item production cost decreases. (-10%)<br/><br/>As a result, those players in the fields of daily life and production felt a marked increase in work efficiency.<br/><br/>“Hey, I can peel off the leather easily when I just touch it with my hand! I feel like I’m opening a zipper.”<br/><br/>The tanners were now able to peel the leather so easily they could not complain about a pain in their wrists, and the blacksmiths’ hammering was much stronger than before.<br/><br/>“Man, even if I put in roughly anything and boil the water, I can get the buffs. Just amazing!”<br/><br/>Cooks could also give players the buff effect more easily and powerfully, apart from the taste of the food.<br/><br/>The buffs of the Lucky Pole affected not only the players but also the natural environment of the designated area.<br/><br/>“Since we installed the Lucky Pole, the amount of medicinal herbs in Mt. Paldal seems to have increased.”<br/><br/>“It looks like those players working in the potion room will be busier. There are not many players there.”<br/><br/>Herbs grown in Paldalsan were widely used in various fields such as potions and food.<br/><br/>And if they mixed the medicinal herbs with ‘Troll’s blood’, which was recently brought in large quantities, they could make high-grade health recovery potions.<br/><br/>On the other hand, they renovated a nearby shopping mall into something like a ‘hangar’.<br/><br/>They decided to store and manage large weapons such as the Ballista and Singijon.<br/><br/>Kyongsu even planned on where to place the Singijon and Ballista in the upcoming war.<br/><br/>“As I expect the number of flying weapons in the future, I’m thinking of growing archery forces specialized in managing and operating large equipment.”<br/><br/>Kyungsoo was in charge of managing the internal affairs of the village. Recently, three more players joined to help him with his administrative work.<br/><br/>They had a separate office and were working under the name of the “Ministry of General Affairs.” They were in charge of managing the gold deposited in the “Vault of Oath” and human resources.<br/><br/>“Good. Let’s rest for the next 12 hours then start the massive attack of the dungeon of the next difficulty level. Please provide good food for the players who trained hard,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Sure. During the break, let me have the ‘surveillance team’ in full operation because this is the time when our security is at a low point.”<br/><br/>Currently, the “surveillance team”, which was created temporarily, was closely monitoring the surroundings of the invisible barrier using Jeongho’s new skill “Eye of the Air”.<br/><br/>With his new skill, he could monitor the invisible barrier with the naked eye like CCTV. Including Jeongho, three others were scrutinizing different directions.<br/><br/>While the World Tree camp was operating fully like this, somebody was watching their every movement from a distance.<br/><br/>“Check the target!”<br/><br/>One guy, who very secretly followed and watched Sungwoo and the players of the World Tree camp going into the dungeon and taking out all the items, stopped walking outside the invisible barrier.<br/><br/>“I’m sure he is our target. I’ve noticed a huge tree of unknown identity, a tree exuding a powerful force somewhere.”<br/><br/>On a rooftop where they can see the world tree, a man wearing a black mask came out from the shadow.<br/><br/>“And now they seem to be taking a break.”<br/><br/>He jumped at once to the building on the other side, then naturally disappeared into another shadow.<br/><br/>In an empty space, only a very small voice mumbled like the sound of the wind.<br/><br/>“It seems we can kill the target at the right time when he comes out of the invisible barrier. Let me keep monitoring him until he comes out.” </div><h2 id="chapter220">Chapter 220</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>After they had 12 hours of break time, they resumed the tough training.<br/><br/>“This time the large-scale dungeon is on the ‘A University campus’. You will see fanatics appearing there. I think the boss monster is a kind of corrupt spirit.”<br/><br/>“I think we have to practice not only blocking their physical attacks but also their magic or curse attacks.”<br/><br/>“Then, let me dispatch an advance party there to check out the situation right away.”<br/><br/>The World Tree camp decided to dispatch an advance party before formally attacking the dungeon. The advance party consisted of Hanho, Inho, and 25 players from Group 2.<br/><br/>“Although the dungeon is located in a nearby place, it’s still outside the invisible barrier, so you should be very careful in carrying out your mission,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Yep! Don’t worry. I will pray for them right away if something happens.”<br/><br/>When Hanho said that proudly, Kyongsu made a puzzled expression.<br/><br/>“Prayer?”<br/><br/>“Hahaha, yeah I know something.”<br/><br/>“Okay, let’s go anyway.”<br/><br/>The advance team was supposed to start first, thoroughly check the area around the dungeon entrance, and set up a guard post.<br/><br/>If they were ambushed while attacking the dungeon, they would be defenseless without getting any support from outsiders, so they wanted to prepare for such a possibility in advance.<br/><br/>“I am going to load the material in a truck and move there. You have to finish setting up the guard post within 4 hours,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/>The advance party decided to move along the road that they had opened in advance. It would be more convenient to use a helicopter or Bone Wyvern, but they wanted to secure another route in advance because it’s dangerous to use only one road.<br/><br/>“Come on, let’s start again!”<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>“They are moving now. This time they are moving through the road. Given their movement, they are moving in the east. Unit 3, check the target!”<br/><br/>The masked men in black clothes were positioned everywhere around the invisible barrier of the World Tree camp. They were monitoring the movement of Sungwoo and his party as well as the village players because they were not sure when and where they went out of the invisible barrier.<br/><br/>Soon, Sungwoo’s party began to gather along the road their truck traveled. They spread widely in all directions, then began to merge into a single line.<br/><br/>These masked men waited like shadows, then moved like the wind. They crisscrossed the buildings to catch up with the truck running on the road in no time.<br/><br/>“Stop!”<br/><br/>When the truck slowed down, these guys stopped, too.<br/><br/>“Stand by!”<br/><br/>They lay in wait after moving to their assigned positions.<br/><br/>At that moment, one masked man in the rear looked back, startled.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>“What’s up?”<br/><br/>“Didn’t you notice somebody moving around us?”<br/><br/>“Somebody?”<br/><br/>When he said that, his colleague touched the “kunai sword” hidden under his wrist with his index finger. As a fellow ninja, he knew his intuition was trustworthy. But he didn’t find anything unusual.<br/><br/>“I don’t know. Are you sure? It could be a wild animal, not a human.”<br/><br/>“Oh, maybe. But it was certainly not a wild animal.”<br/><br/>This guy could tell the movement of a wild animal from that of a human.<br/><br/>With an anxious look, he looked around.<br/><br/>“Hey, don’t worry. Hayabusa is going to take care of it. He is protecting us at a certain distance.”<br/><br/>“I know.”<br/><br/>“If he doesn’t say anything to us, we are safe. Who can dare to shadow us?”<br/><br/>“Yeah, you’re right.”<br/><br/>They knew how to move like a professional assassin without leaving any traces of their footsteps or their movement.<br/><br/>They reveal themselves only when they cut the neck of their prey, and they are only reflected in the pupils of the dying prey.<br/><br/>‘Am I too nervous? There is no way anyone can follow us because we don’t leave behind any traces. And we’ve never been shadowed.’<br/><br/>However, he began to reveal his anxiety finally.<br/><br/>“Hey, have you contacted Hayabusa?”<br/><br/>The leader of the ninjas approached them and asked.<br/><br/>“Pardon? What do you mean?”<br/><br/>“There was no response from him a couple of minutes ago.”<br/><br/>“No way…”<br/><br/>Like his name, meaning ‘falcon’ suggested, Hayabusa was like a surveillance satellite for ninjas.<br/><br/>He was supposed to monitor and warn everyone, but they lost track of him at this important moment.<br/><br/>They didn’t panic because they knew there were always variables in the field, disrupting their plans anytime. Like a professional, they managed to switch to a different strategy calmly when that happened.<br/><br/>“Hey, you guys move to area F and check the location of Hayabusa. Even if something happened to him, you should not engage in fighting with the enemy.”<br/><br/>The two masked men nodded and disappeared into the building across the street.<br/><br/>“Then, are you going to carry out the operation?”<br/><br/>“Of course. We are going to kill the enemy advance party first, then cut the Necromancer’s neck in the ambush. We can kill him at one stroke no matter how strong he is.”<br/><br/>Their first target, the advance party of the World Tree camp, suddenly stopped near the campus of a university. Although they were on alert, monitoring their surroundings closely, they could not confirm the location of the ninja group.<br/><br/>“You’re right. We have never failed to kill anybody at a single stroke until now.”<br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/>-Category: job synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: 10 or more ninja jobs<br/><br/>-Effect: All defense and resistance become 0, but at the same time nullifies all the defense and resistance power of the target. Also, the damage of the ‘first attack’ is greatly increased. (+500%)<br/><br/>Ninja kills their opponents with one single stroke. That’s why they were training so hard to deal one fatal blow to their opponents.<br/><br/>There were many strong players in the Japanese server, especially in the Kyushu region.<br/><br/>At first, the “Yamato Guild” was a group that was not so strong.<br/><br/>However, they changed their images after their ninja group led by the swordmaster Okata Akira killed the strong players of other guilds overnight. They could establish themselves as the foremost guild by repeating tremendous growth without any hindrance.<br/><br/>“There can be no failure in this small land.”<br/><br/>And they are now expanding their power to the Korean server, the hottest issue in the world these days.<br/><br/>“Okay, our operation has begun!”<br/><br/>When the leader shouted, the ninjas laid their hands on the back of their swords and scattered in all directions.<br/><br/>There were a total of 27 ninjas. They already located their prey. According to their enemies’ movement, they kept changing their movement, too. They approached naturally and secretly.<br/><br/>As the distance between them narrowed to a minimum and their breathing and walking stopped, they put their right hands on the back of the swords like a butterfly. Then, like a falcon, they hid in the shadows of a mountain and spread their legs in the air while gliding down.<br/><br/>They expected they would finish killing their targets in just a few seconds.<br/><br/>Finally, they began to see blood gushing from somebody.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>Blood was gushing not from their prey. The upper body of the ninja at the forefront was cut in half and fell on the concrete floor. The other half, namely his lower body, was thrown off and hung on a branch in the distance.<br/><br/>‘What the heck is this?’<br/><br/>They never expected this kind of situation. The ninjas stopped for a moment.<br/><br/>But their leader thought, ‘We can’t retreat like this. Let’s break through!’<br/><br/>If they gave up because they were caught, they would not be able to take the next step.<br/><br/>The leader blew a whistle like the chirping of a bird. The eleven ninjas bent themselves sharply then jumped off the ground. Then, they drew the swords at the same time and charged at their opponents at a terrific speed. They were going to attack their target from the front.<br/><br/>“Uh? What is this?”<br/><br/>“We have been ambushed!”<br/><br/>Only then did the players of the World Tree camp notice the appearance of the assassins.<br/><br/>But it was already too late. It looked like they would be killed immediately by the ninjas.<br/><br/>After killing the players, they were determined to search for the unknown attacker hiding somewhere.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>At that moment, the ninja leader felt something creepy, but he instinctively threw himself, forgetting his target.<br/><br/>A roar of air exploding narrowly passed over his head.<br/><br/>“Khhhhk!”<br/><br/>He rolled over the concrete floor, then lowered his posture with a sword in his right hand and a dagger in his left hand. Cold sweat fell from his nose.<br/><br/>The bursts of sound came from the place where the roaring passed by. The exterior walls of the building cracked, the streetlights were torn and sparks splattered.<br/><br/>“Khhhhhhhhe!”<br/><br/>“Kuhhhhhhhhh…”<br/><br/>The three ninjas hiding in the building were crushed by the falling debris.<br/><br/>“Crazy!”<br/><br/>The remaining seven seemed to have instinctively fled, but the leader could no longer give any orders. His operation didn’t work out as planned.<br/><br/>He didn’t know what would happen next.<br/><br/>Tramp- Tramp-<br/><br/>Somebody was walking from the alley. He moved deliberately. He didn’t hide even though he could.<br/><br/>Finally, that ghostly swordsman appeared.<br/><br/>“As expected…”<br/><br/>The ninja leader had once seen her through the Korean server.<br/><br/>A long-haired woman wearing a red sweatsuit, and ‘Ghost Face Armor’ in the shape of a goblin’s teeth. Her expressionless eyes seemed arrogant rather than murderous.<br/><br/>She slowly walked out, drawing one of her two swords from her back, and stood in front of the ninjas. An unidentified blue flame was floating above her right shoulder, creating an unrealistic threat.<br/><br/>“Hey, Sis Jisu?”<br/><br/>Hanho among the advance party recognized her first. </div><h2 id="chapter221">Chapter 221</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Ninjas always move behind someone’s back, holding others’ lives at their mercy.<br/><br/>But this was their first time being stricken with fear that their lives were at the mercy of others.<br/><br/>‘Isn’t it true that both Hayabusa and his two minions were already killed? Given I don’t have their synergy effect anymore, it’s true.”<br/><br/>The ninja leader looked at the bodies of the three men lying on the ground. It meant six of his ninja group were killed before they saw their assassin. As a result, the synergy effect of “Operation Ninja”, which required ten ninjas, was over.<br/><br/>The female warrior in red scanned the ninja slowly with the players of the World Tree camp behind her. She seemed to have grasped all the ninja’s positions and movements.<br/><br/>The ninja leader went forward and stood before her.<br/><br/>He said, “I’ve heard that a great warrior is moving with the Necromancer, but I’ve never thought you were so strong. My name is Tomada Kato.”<br/><br/>He formally introduced himself to her, but the woman reacted coldly.<br/><br/>“So what?”<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>Toma was back on alert, stepping back.<br/><br/>“How rude you are! Don’t you have any honor as a swordsman like us?” he shouted.<br/><br/>“It looks like you guys are too immersed in the ninja game.”<br/><br/>“What the heck did you say?”<br/><br/>“Just disgusting.”<br/><br/>Kato’s anger soared at her snubbing even when she ambushed and inflicted great damage on his ninja group. He gnashed his teeth and lifted the blade of his sword against her.<br/><br/>“It is commendable that you shadowed and ambushed us, but do you think you are confident of defeating us right now? Okay, let me make you regret your decision.”<br/><br/>He rubbed his heel twice. It was an attack signal to his men standing behind him.<br/><br/>Shhh!<br/><br/>There was the sound of wind tearing behind his back. Their attack began. Kato threw the kunai dagger hidden in his left wrist at her and ran to her right.<br/><br/>‘If we attack her from all sides, she will clearly show her weakness!’<br/><br/>Siege of the enemy was a standard formula in any fight. Kato was now trying to seize her from all directions.<br/><br/>His subordinates also ran in different directions and corrected their position, aiming for the chance to stab her in the ribs.<br/><br/>Shhh! Shhh!<br/><br/>In the meantime, they kept throwing kunai daggers at her. Dozens of kunai daggers rained down on the woman.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the woman hit back all the kunai daggers flying at her by moving her wrist a few times lightly.<br/><br/>‘Good!’<br/><br/>However, while the woman was absorbed in blocking their kuna daggers, Kato’s subordinates already succeeded in seizing her from all directions.<br/><br/>“Kill her!”<br/><br/>“Let me you regret coming to us!”<br/><br/>They charged at her using their ninja skill ‘Momentary Hiding.’ No matter how fast she could respond, it seemed impossible for her to handle the ninja who took turns appearing and disappearing.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>To their surprise, the woman disappeared before their eyes.<br/><br/>“Kheeeeeh!”<br/><br/>She jumped out behind one of the ninjas who was trying to attack her from behind.<br/><br/>Embarrassed, the ninja swung his sword, but only after she cut his neck.<br/><br/>“That’s her ‘footprint tracking’ skill!”<br/><br/>The ninjas knew what her skill was.<br/><br/>“That’s one of the skills our swordmaster uses…”<br/><br/>Since it was one of the skills used by their boss, the swordmaster Okata Akira, they realized how high her level was.<br/><br/>In the blink of an eye, she cut the neck of another ninja.<br/><br/>Now, there were only seven ninjas left.<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>“Block her attack!”<br/><br/>The tide was turned instantly with the ninjas being on the defensive. They leaped back and widened their distance with the woman. Their escape was instinctive, not pre-planned.<br/><br/>However, the woman ran like a wild beast, biting the ninjas’ necks one after another.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>“Damn it! Go away!”<br/><br/>The moment they touched her and her sword, their bodies were cut here and there even before they confronted her.<br/><br/>There were now five of them left.<br/><br/>“Captain, what should I do now?” one of his subordinates asked. Kato was as frustrated as his men, not knowing what to do.<br/><br/>Shaking his head, Kato said, “Shit! We can’t block her with our level. It’s time our swordmaster confronted her directly.”<br/><br/>“Really? Is she so strong?”<br/><br/>“Well, maybe more than that…”<br/><br/>Kato also felt the woman’s skills so clearly, but he knew he could never catch up with her no matter how much he trained.<br/><br/>“So, what should we do from now on?”<br/><br/>“All we can do is…”<br/><br/>Kato thought of fleeing from the scene, but he could dare to say it.<br/><br/>Could he succeed in escaping? Was he already in her striking range?<br/><br/>As if she read his mind, she said slowly in a low voice, “Don’t think about running away.”<br/><br/>It was like the sentence of death to him<br/><br/>At that moment, the blue flame drifting over her shoulders seeped into the blade of her sword.<br/><br/>Something like a dark blue wave began to come out of the black blade.<br/><br/>When she swung the blade, dozens of blue sword energy balls rotated at high speed and scattered forward.<br/><br/>Kwaguguguguaa!<br/><br/>As if dozens of beasts rushed at their prey at once and crushed them with their claws, she cut them with the powerful sword attack and ripped them apart.<br/><br/>“Aaaaaaaaah!”<br/><br/>“Khuuuuuuuuul!”<br/><br/>With just one stroke, she wiped out everyone who had been hiding between the two buildings.<br/><br/>The ninjas tried to hide somewhere by all means, but wherever they went, the sword energies instantly swept over them, cutting their bodies.<br/><br/>It was like a storm, and their fight was finally over.<br/><br/>Only a whirlwind that arose amid their fierce fight blew into the alley.<br/><br/>“Sis Jisu? You must be Jisu, right?”<br/><br/>Hanho, who was watching the scene in shock, came to his senses and approached her.<br/><br/>She wiped the blood off the sword and put it back into the sheath behind her.<br/><br/>“Man, where have you been? We were so worried about you! And you came back at the perfect time like this…”<br/><br/>“I arrived here several hours ago.”<br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/>Jisu already arrived in Suwon a few hours ago. After she sensed some ominous movement of the enemies, she decided not to reveal herself immediately. She was chasing after the assassins, waiting for the right time to counterattack.<br/><br/>Her strategy was successful. Not only did she block the assassins trying to flee after they smelled a rat, but she killed them all.<br/><br/>“What about Sungwoo?”<br/><br/>“Oh, he will be here soon.”<br/><br/>About an hour later, Sungwoo joined them.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Jisu explained to Sungwoo what had happened to her until now.<br/><br/>After she fell in the middle of Mt. Taebaek because of the item ‘Real Landscape Painting of the Spirit’, she survived a bloody fight with monsters on the mountain.<br/><br/>The moment she defeated one of the strongest monsters, she was given a ‘Hidden Quest’.<br/><br/>[Hidden Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: Encounter the “King of the Great Mountain.”<br/><br/>-Type: Finding the target<br/><br/>-Goal: Reach the ‘King’s mountain cabin.’<br/><br/>-Reward: Qualified for ‘Extra Hidden Quest’.<br/><br/>*The “King of the Great Mountains” who rules Mt. Taebaek wants to face the strong man who defeated one of his “vassals”. He’s not a violent monster but a rational being. He wants to interact with qualified players.<br/><br/>When you face the King of the Great Mountain, you will get an ‘Unexpected Quest’, and that quest can make a big change in your destiny.<br/><br/>* If you cannot clear the quest within 48 hours, the ‘Hidden Quest’ will be canceled.<br/><br/>* The King of the Great Mountain is going to test you. As you get closer to the King’s mountain cabin, you will confront more fierce monsters.<br/><br/>Jisu continued, “After wandering the mountain for a long time, I was able to meet the boss monster called the King of the Great Mountain. Well, it looked like the monster serpent Imoogi…”<br/><br/>She said she could converse with the King, but what she said next was surprising.<br/><br/>“King of the Great Mountain, he gave me a quest.”<br/><br/>She not only conversed with him but also received a quest from him. This meant that he was not just a boss monster, but also he played the role of an NPC.<br/><br/>“Which quest was it?”<br/><br/>“He told me to find the item called ‘Ginseng of the Mountain Spirit’ that had been stolen by the Struggle Guild. As a reward, he offered the last item of Shadow King that you are trying to collect and my Awakening.”<br/><br/>‘Awakening’ was a privilege that was given to only those players with four-star jobs who cleared the ‘Exclusive Quest’. Unfortunately, she could not receive the exclusive quest in the past because she chose a three-star job, ‘Tiger Fighter.’<br/><br/>However, she could finally obtain the qualifications for the quest thanks to the Hidden Quest.<br/><br/>“And the legacy of the Shadow King…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t know the King would mention that name.<br/><br/>Jisu said, “Oh, the King of the Great Mountain asked me to choose an item for an additional reward, so I immediately took notice of that item because you needed it, Sungwoo.”<br/><br/>The last item Sungwoo had been looking for was on Mt. Taebaek.<br/><br/>Jisu noticed and selected it as a quest reward.<br/><br/>“But how did you get here? It must be quite a long distance between here and Mt. Taebaek.”<br/><br/>“Ah, I was helped by the King of the Great Mountain.”<br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain gave her an item with which she could open the portal to her desired destination.<br/><br/>Then, she predicted that Sungwoo, who had defeated the Struggle Guild, had the ‘Ginseng of the Mountain Spirit,’ so she opened the portal to Suwon.<br/><br/>“Given that the King has helped you so much like this, it seems he badly needs the ‘Ginseng of the Mountain Spirit.'”<br/><br/>“I think so. We don’t know why he needs it, but that’s what we need right now.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded and pulled out the ‘Ginseng of the Mountain Spirit’ from inside the pocket.<br/><br/>It was an item that he obtained from Bumyol after he was killed. </div><h2 id="chapter222">Chapter 222</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Ginseng of the Mountain Spirit<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: consumption<br/><br/>-Effect: By accepting the ‘Mountain Spirit’, you can get a tremendous increase in stats. Also, the ‘affinity and dominance’ for nature and spirits increases significantly, and you can sometimes get the’ power of the mountain god’ (deity status).<br/><br/>* Caution! To fully absorb it, you need a ‘stamina level’ of at least 80. (Recommended: 100)<br/><br/>* Caution! If you already have a different ‘deity’ status, they can clash against each other and have adverse effects.<br/><br/>-Description: This is the ‘spirit’ formed after an unqualified person forcibly took the ‘Ginseng of the Mountain Spirit’, so it has become much stronger because it was taken by an arrogant person.<br/><br/>Sungwoo said, “I think what I have is probably that item, the ‘Ginseng of Mountain Spirit.'”<br/><br/>It was an item with which Sungwoo could get deity status, but he could not use it, not to mention any colleague who could meet the requirement for its use.<br/><br/>So, he gave it to Jisu because he trusted her so much.<br/><br/>‘For me, the legacy of the Shadow King is far more valuable than this,’ he thought to himself.<br/><br/>If he could get the Shadow King’s legacy, the last item, he would be able to get stronger. No matter how much he would spend, he wanted to have this item by all means.<br/><br/>“Oh, I think you’re right. Thanks, I’ll bring you the Last Legacy of the Shadow King by all means.”<br/><br/>Jisu accepted the ‘Ginseng of the Mountain Spirit’ then took out a scroll, which seemed to be an item that could take her back to Mt. Taebaek.<br/><br/>“I think I have to go back now.”<br/><br/>He felt a bit uncomfortable about her going back to the deep mountains, but he had no choice but to trust her and wait<br/><br/>“Be careful. Don’t believe him unconditionally. Even if he is good to you, he’s nothing but a monster!”<br/><br/>“I’ll keep it in mind.”<br/><br/>Jisu soon opened the portal using the scroll. She walked into it. Shortly afterward, the portal was closed and she disappeared again.<br/><br/>“Uh? Where is Sis Jisu? She is not parting with us to be independent, right?”<br/><br/>“Just think she is on a business trip.”<br/><br/>“Are you sure? Let me ask you just in case. Please don’t send me on a business trip.”<br/><br/>Right after that, Sungwoo resurrected the bodies of the ninjas into skeletons.<br/><br/>-You can check the ‘memory fragments’ of the deceased.<br/><br/>“Sure, show me who sent them.”<br/><br/>Although Sungwoo was preparing for an attack from an overseas server, he never thought that an assassination team would be dispatched so quickly like this. Although he was very much embarrassed, he felt strongly inclined to fight and beat them.<br/><br/>‘Let me find out the guys who were responsible for sending the ninjas and get even with them so they can’t challenge us again’<br/><br/>Sungwoo was determined to make the instigators pay the painful price.<br/><br/>Soon, the scenes were shown through the fragments of the memory. They were the memories of the ninja. The place was the lobby of a shopping mall in Korea. Dozens of ninjas caught Sungwoo’s eyes. They numbered more than twice the ninjas Jisu killed.<br/><br/>‘It means there are more ninjas somewhere right now.’<br/><br/>The owner of the whole plan raised the map of the Korean Peninsula. His finger pointed to what seemed to be the location they were then Suwon.<br/><br/>“No. 1 unit keeps moving eastward to Suwon. No. 2 Unit, you guys follow this highway to Cheonan and complete your mission.”<br/><br/>It seemed that they were talking a few days before the attack.<br/><br/>“The “Hunter Company” building in Cheonan Station. You want us to destroy that building then join our forces in Suwon. Is that our Plan A?”<br/><br/>“Right. We have no specific goal. Just destroy it, so much so that they can not rebuild it. That’s our client’s request.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo smelled a rat at that point.<br/><br/>‘Client? Is the client aiming at me and the Hunter Company at the same time?’<br/><br/>He recalled only one name at that moment.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>On the rooftop of a hotel building at Cheonan Station, Ninjas dressed in black quickly landed there. They climbed up the outer wall of the building and penetrated the rooftop.<br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/>“Kheeeeeeek!”<br/><br/>They easily assassinated the guards on the rooftop and gathered at the entrance of the staircases leading to the building.<br/><br/>“We’ve removed them all.”<br/><br/>There was no fuss while they killed five security guards. Those in the building were unaware that somebody from outside had infiltrated the building.<br/><br/>“Good. According to the information I obtained from torturing a man captured on the ground, their leaders are now in a penthouse. If we storm there and kill them all, they will collapse quickly.”<br/><br/>After he was done briefing, the leader of the No. 2 Unit put on a mask. Then, he pointed his finger at the floor.<br/><br/>“Now, go through the ventilation and kill those in the upper corridor first. Go!”<br/><br/>The ninjas moved in unison and carried out the planned operation. The synergy of  added deadly power to their movements.<br/><br/>Like painless, deadly poison spreading through veins, the ninjas slowly began to occupy the building.<br/><br/>Then, shortly afterward, the door of the penthouse opened, and seven ninjas entered.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>“Who the hell are you?”<br/><br/>The president of Hunter Company and his executives who were meeting in the office of the penthouse opened their eyes wide.<br/><br/>“How are you?”<br/><br/>“Who the hell are you?”<br/><br/>The Hunter Company leaders were stunned by their unexpected visit and overwhelmed.<br/><br/>Wasn’t this a penthouse on the top floor of the hotel? In other words, there was watertight security around the penthouse with multiple layers of security guards guarding the place.<br/><br/>But the ninjas infiltrated without being caught, which meant they could not handle these infiltrators.<br/><br/>“Stop, everybody!”<br/><br/>The president stopped the executives from trying to take out their weapons and stood up.<br/><br/>He sighed, putting his hand in his pocket.<br/><br/>“Okay. You guys are the ninjas belonging to the Yamato Guild who had secret meetings with the Evolution Society, right?”<br/><br/>“Oh, you have been digging up the information about our client. It looks like you guys are not dumb,” one of the ninjas said.<br/><br/>The ninja then lowered his mask and sat down on the sofa. He seemed relaxed.<br/><br/>The president sitting on the opposite side faced the ninja, then said, “Of course. That client was once our client. They gathered information about you through us.”<br/><br/>“Really? But I don’t think you should act arrogantly like that. You dumb bastard, knowing nothing!”<br/><br/>At that moment, the ninjas moved and cut the necks of two of the four executives.<br/><br/>They put the blade against the president’s neck. He glared at them, swallowing nervously.<br/><br/>“Hey, don’t try to put on airs. We are not negotiators. We only move to kill people.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“The stupid Korean server, and the Necromancer, the symbol of your server, will soon die.”<br/><br/>At that point, the president of the Hunter Company smiled before he knew it.<br/><br/>“Hahaha!”<br/><br/>“Are you laughing now?”<br/><br/>“Did you say that you would kill the Necromancer? No way! I don’t think so.”<br/><br/>The president was in awe the moment the “World Quest” appeared because he believed he was the only one who would solve the fundamental problem of this game. Therefore, he had a vague belief that the Necromancer would never die.<br/><br/>The ninja smiled scornfully then responded.<br/><br/>“Did you say you didn’t believe what I said? That’s your problem!”<br/><br/>The ninja pushed his head down and tightened his hold on the handle of the sword. Blood was coming from the president’s neck.<br/><br/>The ninja continued, “From the very distant past, you’ve been swimming in a well, trying to keep your pride without knowing anything.”<br/><br/>He struck the table with his fist. The center of the wooden table was hollowed out as if it had been hit with a hammer.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“But in the end, the moment you’re placed in the wild like this, your bare face is revealed. You inferior people!”<br/><br/>The ninja stood up and started spinning the sword.<br/><br/>“So, now it’s time to kill …”<br/><br/>But at that moment, the ninja raised his head suddenly.<br/><br/>“Boss!”<br/><br/>“Somebody is coming to us!”<br/><br/>All the ninjas felt something strange, so they looked out of the window, stunned.<br/><br/>At that moment, something wriggling on the wall caught their eyes.<br/><br/>It looked like a ghost, but passed through the wall and disappeared.<br/><br/>Thud! Thud!<br/><br/>The next moment the sound of bursting rang from the hotel’s ceiling, along with tremendous vibrations. Soon, cracks like spider webs spread and stone dust poured out, causing the whole ceiling to be lifted.<br/><br/>“What the heck is going on?”<br/><br/>Wind blew in along with the debris from the ceiling. The ninjas frowned as the sunlight fell on them directly. The president of the Hunter Company found something between them.<br/><br/>“Oh, my God! No way…”<br/><br/>Dozens of Bone Wyverns were raising their wicked claws and scraping a pile of concrete like tofu.<br/><br/>“Necromancer?”<br/><br/>“No way, he can’t be here!”<br/><br/>When the ninja denied it in an embarrassed voice, the president scored at him.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, did you deny what I said?”<br/><br/>“You bastard, how dare you speak out against me?”<br/><br/>The ninja tried to swing his sword, but the Necromancer, a man wearing a dark green robe, landed on a wooden table in the middle of the penthouse.<br/><br/>Startled, the ninjas stepped back. They threatened to charge at him, but they didn’t dare to.<br/><br/>-Your body functions are weakened due to unknown energy.<br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-4)<br/><br/>When they encountered a message they couldn’t understand, they had no choice but to feel fear beyond embarrassment.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>“Why are our stats going down?”<br/><br/>“How could they break through the roof and come in?”<br/><br/>The Necromancer, standing in the middle of them, slowly looked around.<br/><br/>He soon fixed his eyes on the president of the Hunter Company.<br/><br/>“Are you taking care of my request well?”<br/><br/>“Well…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo continued, stroking the wounds on his neck with his hand.<br/><br/>“Let me ask you for some more.”<br/><br/>“You mean an additional quest?”<br/><br/>“Bring me the information about the Japanese server.”<br/><br/>“If you mean the Japanese server…”<br/><br/>The Necromancer looked at the face of the ninja leader and slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“I think the Japanese server is going to be my next hunting ground.” </div><h2 id="chapter223">Chapter 223</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>The ninjas, who were overwhelmed by the appearance of the Necromancer, could not move recklessly. Even while the Necromancer and the president of Hunter Company were talking, they shut their mouths as if they were the extras.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>If they charged at the Necromancer quickly and stabbed him, they could kill him right away, no matter how strong he was.<br/><br/>But strangely enough, they got cold feet. They felt weakened not only physically but also mentally.<br/><br/>‘I really can’t pluck up the courage to move. What’s wrong with me?’<br/><br/>They didn’t know it, but it was because of Sungwoo’s “deity status.” Repressed by his demigod status, they were terrified, and their muscles were stiffened. When the Necromancer in the shape of a black wolf glared at them with green eyes, they flinched before they knew it.<br/><br/>“Oh, information about the Japanese server? Sure, I’ll try to get it,” said the president.<br/><br/>When the Necromancer said that he chose the Japan server as his next hunting ground, he kept nodding. Even at the insulting moment, the ninjas could not do anything.<br/><br/>“By the way, let me open these guys’ heads first.”<br/><br/>“Their heads?”<br/><br/>The ninjas could not understand what the Necromancer was talking about, but they came to their senses at that terrible expression. They realized that even if they did nothing, they would be killed by him anyway.<br/><br/>“Damn it! Kill him!”<br/><br/>“Move!”<br/><br/>At their leader’s order, they reluctantly moved, but it was too late. Skeletons in a bizarre shape came out of the collapsed ceilings and exterior walls of the building.<br/><br/>They charged at the ninjas instantly, snatching them with their long arms, breaking their heads.<br/><br/>“What the heck are these monsters?”<br/><br/>They were none other than the Giant Jannabi skeletons. They fought very well in the forest, but here in the collapsed building, they were good fighters.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuuuhuh!”<br/><br/>Since the ninjas had their senses dulled by Sungwoo’s deity status, they were easily caught by the long, thick hands of the monster monkeys from all directions.<br/><br/>Their fight was quickly over.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo could not find any “memory fragments” from their heads.<br/><br/>It seemed that the ninjas here had no important information because they were lower in rank than the ones Sungwoo killed in Suwon.<br/><br/>There was only one other source of information. After eavesdropping using the ‘Specter,’ he realized that the Hunter Company had some intelligence contacts in Japan.<br/><br/>Sungwoo sat on the sofa in the middle of the penthouse where the ceiling was blown off.<br/><br/>The president and executives of the Hunter Company stared at him blankly.<br/><br/>“Okay, as I told you, can you take a look at my request and check your source in Japan?”<br/><br/>“Sure, of course.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo wasn’t joking when he said his next hunting ground would be the Japanese server. He just needed a guide.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The Hunter Company had been faithfully conducting a background investigation of the Evolutionary Society after its president and top executives were taken hostage and threatened by Sungwoo.<br/><br/>However, they didn’t collect any useful information since the core leaders of the Evolution Society were kept secret. To make matters worse, they were caught shadowing the Evolution Society, so one whole investigation team was annihilated.<br/><br/>After they lost favor with the Evolution Society, the ninjas of the Yamato Guild, another mercenary, stormed into their building to kill them.<br/><br/>“Although we couldn’t identify the core leaders of the Evolution Society, we were trying to find out what they were up to. I think our information will be of great help to you, Necromancer.”<br/><br/>Junho Paek, the president of the Hunter Company, checked Sungwoo’s expression while explaining his findings to him proudly.<br/><br/>Junho found himself admiring him at some point. When Junho was saved by the Necromancer, he almost became a fan of his lifesaver.<br/><br/>“We have maintained contacts on the Chinese and Japanese servers for a long time. Based on their information, we can collect information in real-time.”<br/><br/>He grew his company in a systematic and organized way, so he could collect information through official contacts in Japan and China. So, they could help Sungwoo to some extent.<br/><br/>“So, if you can ask me for any information, I will collect and tell you everything about it in as much detail as I can.”<br/><br/>“It seems like the Japanese server is devising a plan to attack me or our server?”<br/><br/>Junho immediately started briefing him.<br/><br/>“That’s right. Shortly after World Quest was issued, there was something unusual on the Japanese server.”<br/><br/>“What is that?”<br/><br/>“It is also known as Japan Bashing Korea.”<br/><br/>According to Junho, the so-called “Kyushu Unified Army”, with the Yamato Guild as the central forces, was preparing for an attack on the Korean peninsula with the motto of “Japan Bashing Korea.’<br/><br/>Although the groups in that plot were trying to block any intelligence leaking out, they could not stop the relevant rumors and gossip from circulating on the server community.<br/><br/>In other words, their plan to infiltrate the Korean server was not made official, but it was virtually a fait accompli.<br/><br/>“Do you have any details?”<br/><br/>“I’m not 100 percent sure because we collected the rumors and tips from some petty members of the Japanese server, but it seems their massive forces are preparing to land in Busan.”<br/><br/>Busan? It looked like they made a very detailed plan on landing in Busan, the biggest port city of Korea in the south.<br/><br/>“Large troops? How many?”<br/><br/>“Well, I think the Yamato Guild is the central force of the Kyushu United Army, so when they seized power, they mobilized many ninjas to assassinate the heads of the neighboring organizations. So, the organizations in Kyushu didn’t suffer any big damage.”<br/><br/>Junho scratched his head and continued.<br/><br/>“As for the size of their troops, I guess they can mobilize over 4000 as a combined army. Considering their reserve forces, I think they can mobilize up to 6,000.”<br/><br/>Considering that the population of the Kyushu region was much smaller than that of other Japanese islands, up to 6000 was huge. Certainly, the damage caused by the war seemed to be small in the Kyushu area.<br/><br/>“So, in my opinion, they don’t seem to have much experience combating their opponents. As you know, during the Japanese army’s massive invasion of Korea during the 17th century, their troops were very dreadful to Koreans because they had great combat experience from the civil war of their home country.”<br/><br/>Junho provided him with even the backgrounder about the Japanese forces.<br/><br/>‘In fact, 4,000 or even 6,000 troops are not that big.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo had already experienced fighting against thousands of players including the Chinese pirates and the Red Revolutionary forces.<br/><br/>‘What matters is the quality of the troops.’<br/><br/>It could be a fatal mistake to judge, as Junho reasoned, that the Japanese forces would not be strong simply because they had little combat experience.<br/><br/>‘Since this world has turned into a game, the number of troops is more important than skill in a large-scale battle, and what’s more important than the number is the level of the players, and what’s more important than the level are the items.’<br/><br/>There was a possibility that they already secured a higher level and better items by attacking a large dungeon rather than fighting against their opponents.<br/><br/>In the case of the Red Revolutionary Forces, they had some fighting experience while waging a campaign to occupy Taiwan, but they could not launch any massive attacks. As a result, they were low-level players who were wiped out by the undead helplessly.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the ‘Struggle Guild’ had little experience fighting against other opponents, but after they increased their levels gradually while fighting in Mt. Taebaek, they could confront Sungwoo with a much smaller number of troops than the Red Revolutionary Forces.<br/><br/>Of course, both troops were devastated by Sungwoo and his allies.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was still too early for Sungwoo to judge the level of Japanese servers.<br/><br/>He needed more information to make the correct judgment.<br/><br/>“Alright. Keep collecting information about them.”<br/><br/>“Sure.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo stood up to leave the place. Junho and his executives also stood up at the same time.<br/><br/>“Oh, I forgot to ask you one more thing,” Sungwoo said, raising his index finger.<br/><br/>“Please go ahead.”<br/><br/>“Think of the way to move to Busan as fast as possible.”<br/><br/>The Kyushu United Army chose Busan as the first stronghold to occupy the Korean server.<br/><br/>But even in this small land of Korea, Busan was far too far from the place where they were now.<br/><br/>“Busan?”<br/><br/>“Right. I should be ready to respond immediately when something happens.”<br/><br/>At that moment, Junho was at a loss how to respond because it was really hard to accept his request no matter how much he thought about it.<br/><br/>“I think my saving your life is enough to cover the expenses for my request, right?”<br/><br/>“Of course!” He could not reject Sungwoo’s request in that situation.<br/><br/>Having said that, the Necromancer disappeared, riding the Bone Wyvern.<br/><br/>Junho stared at him blankly.<br/><br/>“Well, he is cool…”<br/><br/>He was serious. </div><h2 id="chapter224">Chapter 224</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Shortly after Sungwoo arrived in the Suwon village, he agonized over how to inform the villagers about the Japanese server’s plan to invade Busan. He could not post a thread about it because it would leak the information to the enemy.<br/><br/>But Hanho solved his headache simply.<br/><br/>“Oh, that’s easy. Let me leave a secret comment on an old thread posted by the Hwarang Guild.”<br/><br/>If it was an old thread, nobody would confirm it anyway. So, if Hanho posted a secret comment and had the Hwarang Guild confirm it, he could relay a warning message to them.<br/><br/>“Oh, you are very smart in this field, Hanho.”<br/><br/>“Of course, this is basic.”<br/><br/>Hanho succeeded in delivering a message to the Hwarang Guild according to his idea.<br/><br/>─ The strongest one, Hanho Lee (secret): Hello! Do you know my ID? I’m Necromancer’s colleague. I’ve got some information that may be helpful to the Hwarang Guild, so I leave a secret comment to you…Recently, there is a suspicious movement on the Japanese server, so I think the Hwarang Guild needs to be careful.<br/><br/>After only a few minutes, the Hwarang guild confirmed and left a reply.<br/><br/>└ Hwarang Press Bureau (secret): Thank you for the warning. We also continue to monitor the movement of the Japanese server facing the Korean sea, and we also maintain several coastal batteries. We don’t think what you are worried about won’t happen. We Hwarang Guild members love peace and we are strong enough not to bow to any outside forces.<br/><br/>Confirming the message, Hanho said, “It looks like their response is rather cold. In particular, the last line of their message is especially meaningful. Of course, it’s stupid to figure out their intentions from their message…”<br/><br/>The Hwarang Guild said they would not be hostile to the World Tree camp but it was only their political stance. It was inevitable that they had bad feelings toward the Necromancer because they belonged to the Demon camp.<br/><br/>“Well, I did my best.”<br/><br/>Since they said they were doing their job well, Hanho had nothing to add to his comment.<br/><br/>“Whew! I hope the Hwarang Guild guys can come to their senses this time. Coastal batteries? They don’t know this is a game. So, they don’t know where the enemies will attack. Who knows if they will invade through the underground tunnel?”<br/><br/>As Hanho said, it would be naive if they thought that the Japanese players would invade through the land, the standard attack route.<br/><br/>In games there are always variables, so something unexpected always happens.<br/><br/>Didn’t the Red Revolutionary Forces capture the Taiwanese servers in an unexpected way using the “mini-game”?<br/><br/>“We don’t care about anything else. We just have to prepare ourselves for their attack.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his allies would have to fight a war someday, so other camps won’t be of any big help to them. So, they had to come up with their plan to win.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Where does the war begin?<br/><br/>At that time, dozens of super-sized kites flew from a barge on the Korean Strait between Busan and Daemado Island in the darkness.<br/><br/>“Group No. 3, start invading Busan. Good luck!”<br/><br/>It was an item called ‘Ride-on Kite’, a means of penetrating high altitudes for ninjas, which was an item that could fly them on a super-sized kite in the wind.<br/><br/>The Yamato Guild was carrying out the operation of invading the Korean server much more secretly and faster than expected.<br/><br/>Their bold action like that far exceeded Sungwoo’s expectation, not to mention the intelligence of the Hunter Company.<br/><br/>Whuuung-<br/><br/>The ninjas soared in the dark, seeing nothing ahead at all. With the night sky and sea being indistinguishable, there was only one person that they could rely on, namely the leading “guide” that could see through the darkness using a special item.<br/><br/>The rest of the ninjas followed the tail of the kite hanging on a faint light and crisscrossed into the darkness.<br/><br/>“I can finally see the coastline of Busan. They have dispatched a lot of batteries out there.”<br/><br/>They could hear each other’s voices from a distance through the skill called ‘spiritual unity,’ one of their exclusive skills.<br/><br/>“Well, it looks like they spent lots of gold constructing the batteries, Fortunately, it doesn’t seem they found us yet.”<br/><br/>The Hwarang Guild’s coastline batteries were a threat to them.<br/><br/>They installed surveillance posts at key points and numerous ‘mechanical fixed catapults’ along the coastlines of Busan.<br/><br/>If the Yamato Guild’s warship fleet had approached them nearby, they would have been sunk before even attempting to land on the coast with overwhelming power.<br/><br/>However, there was no way for the Hwarang Guild to detect their covert infiltration on a small scale.<br/><br/>“Good, good. We’ll pass by them and land on the northern hill. Lower the altitude from now on.”<br/><br/>The ninjas silently landed in the middle of Mt. Kugok in Busan in the darkness.<br/><br/>Then, they buried the “Ride-on Kit” items under the ground to hide the traces of their infiltration, and all of them finally gathered in one place after teleporting from their first landing place.<br/><br/>“Now, let’s install the ‘Hyper Gate’ item here. How long will it take?”<br/><br/>“It is difficult to infuse large amounts of mana immediately, so it takes at least 12 hours.”<br/><br/>It was a legendary item called ‘Hyper Gate’ that they selected as the first means of infiltration to conquer the Korean server.<br/><br/>It was an item that could open a two-way portal lasting for 10 minutes. Considering that two people can pass through it at the same time, a significant number of troops would be able to penetrate easily through the portal.<br/><br/>“Soon we’ll carry out the operation to support the Evolution Society of the Korean server. They will spray poison gas in Busan.”<br/><br/>He lifted his finger and pointed to the light of the Hwarang Guild camp at the foot of the mountain.<br/><br/>“We’ll trigger the Hyper Gate during the chaotic moment and carry out our operation successfully while watching out for the surroundings.”<br/><br/>“After 12 hours, our main unit will set foot on this land with the Korean server players kept in the dark about our ambush. This is going to be great fun!”<br/><br/>Although they didn’t know the whereabouts of Group No. 1 and Group No. 2 members who first infiltrated the Korean server because they lost contact with the two groups, they didn’t give up because they ended up carrying out their mission successfully despite making numerous sacrifices until now.<br/><br/>And at this moment, they were more confident than before.<br/><br/>“Yeah, we’re going to start from here and move up to Suwon to get rid of the World Tree camp.”<br/><br/>As always, a war begins earlier than expected.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>On the other hand, the World Tree camp was preparing for the upcoming war comprehensively because they got wind of it to some extent.<br/><br/>After learning about the Japanese server’s plan to invade Busan, they revised the defense-oriented strategy and started preparing for a long-distance expedition.<br/><br/>“Well, if we have to fight them in Busan, we should also consider how to move the flying weapons to Busan, which is very far from here. Even if we use the inventory, we can use only ten. But the problem is we’re going to have more and more flying weapons in the future.”<br/><br/>Kyongsu, who was planning the deployment of the flying weapons in consideration of the defense-oriented strategy, raised a question.<br/><br/>But the blacksmiths came up with an idea.<br/><br/>“We have the large undead as well as Bone Wyverns, right? We can have them carry Ballistas on their backs. It’s okay to install the fixed fire rocket arrows.’<br/><br/>The Bone Wyvern was large enough to carry the huge turret Ballista on him.<br/><br/>The blacksmith continued, “I watched the scenes of the Bone Wyverns wiping out the pirates in Taiwan, but it was a little disappointing that they had no choice but to engage in melee fighting despite their aerial advantage. How about us making flying weapons that can show arrows or fire a fatal shot at the enemy while hovering in the sky?”<br/><br/>The blacksmith was talking about something like an air turret.<br/><br/>“Oh, that would be very useful!”<br/><br/>“That’s a good idea.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo also agreed with his idea, and the blacksmiths started making such weapons right away.<br/><br/>First of all, they manufactured a structure that could securely fix the flying weapon to the Bone Wyvern’s backbone. They also made a cover just in case of the Bone Wyvern’s high-speed flight, which could minimize wind resistance.<br/><br/>Soon, they completed the prototype of the new flying weapon. The blacksmiths could produce such weapons so quickly thanks to their excellent skills as well as all kinds of buff effects.<br/><br/>But they needed to test the weapons for real deployment.<br/><br/>“Let’s start the test flight” </div><h2 id="chapter225">Chapter 225</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>While soaring in the sky aboard Bone Wyvern, Sungwoo had one Werewolf skeleton control the ‘fixed turret’. There was a target in one corner of Mt. Paldal. It was about 900m from the Werewolf who was, but as he was looking down from the sky, he had a wider view and more control. Compared to flying weapons on the ground, this kind of remote control had a huge advantage.<br/><br/>“Fire!”<br/><br/>The Werewolf, acting on Sungwoo’s order, pulled the lever of the turret.<br/><br/>Tuuung!<br/><br/>The thick iron bow moved wildly, shaking th0e turret once. Even though it fired an iron spear with an overwhelming force, the Bone Wyvern’s path remained steady despite the reaction force of the turret.<br/><br/>Shhhhhhhhhh!<br/><br/>The iron spear fired from the sky and landed on the target. The dirt around it soared as if it had been struck by a bomb. The iron spear, 180cm long, was stuck halfway into the ground.<br/><br/>“Jackpot!”<br/><br/>“We have succeeded in hitting the target on our first attempt!<br/><br/>Even if there had been a player or a large monster in place of the dummy target, the iron spear would have killed them on the spot.<br/><br/>“What a great success!”<br/><br/>When the Bone Wyvern landed, the blacksmith team leader approached him with pride.<br/><br/>“I’ll fix the minor problems soon. Besides, our team is working on ways to enhance the firepower of the large undead. If we come up with something good, I’ll let you know right away.”<br/><br/>“Good. Thanks for your hard work.”<br/><br/>As seen in their hard training, the World Tree camp was continuously growing in various fields, but they realized that they couldn’t afford to prepare slowly.<br/><br/>-“Korea Server” in an emergency!<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>“What happened?”<br/><br/>While they were kept in the dark about the invasion by the Japanese server players, the inevitable war between them and the Korean server was around the corner.<br/><br/>[Server Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: The 1st Korean-Japanese War<br/><br/>-Type: War<br/><br/>-Purpose: Victory<br/><br/>-Compensation: to be announced later<br/><br/>The Korean and Japanese servers have maintained a history of sharp conflict since the days of the “old world.” And, as expected, their mutual hatred is continuing in the new world. Can the players on both servers finally fight against each other for the final victory?<br/><br/>[Information on the 1st Korean-Japanese War]<br/><br/>Special rules will be given for their exciting war. Here are the details:<br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo saw the message, he looked at Hanho.<br/><br/>“Hanho, check the community right now.”<br/><br/>When Hanho checked the community, he saw a tremendous number of messages about the terrible news about the Japanese server’s attack in Busan.<br/><br/>“Uh, a few hours ago, somebody launched a terrorist attack against the Hwarang Guild camp. Terrorist attack!?”<br/><br/>“Terror?”<br/><br/>“It’s a similar situation to the terrorist attack against Yeongdeungpo Station in the past. Man, this was a large-scale attack! It’s the Japanese server who was responsible for the attack. Crazy! I knew the Hwarang Guild would be attacked!”<br/><br/>Earlier than expected, the ‘Evolution Society’ and the ‘Yamato Guild’ jointly launched the attack.<br/><br/>The Hwarang Guild members, who were not only hit but also ambushed by the Japanese server, abandoned their main base and retreated, resisting against them in the fortress in the rear.<br/><br/>They were even blocked from retreating by the Evolution Society, so they were appealing for support from allies through broadcasts and community posts.<br/><br/>“Man, this kind of Korea-Japan quest is so cruel! Honestly, this is bad.”<br/><br/>The system issued a quest using the two countries’ deep-rooted hatred toward each other. It was evident the Creator enjoyed this situation, urging them to wage a greater war.<br/><br/>What’s more, the system was going to broadcast their fight live to the world through the so-called “official channel”, which was very unfamiliar to everybody.<br/><br/>It seemed safe to say that this was related to the world quest issued some time ago. In other words, by exposing the current situation of the World Tree camp to the world, the system wanted to instigate more active challenges from the players around the world.<br/><br/>[Official channel: LIVE] ‘Worldwide’ live broadcast of the Korean server vs. the Japanese server.<br/><br/>(7,915,144 watching)<br/><br/>Naturally, not long after the official channel started broadcasting, a huge number of viewers flocked to the channel. It was a worldwide broadcast. In other words. every server in the world, every player, would flock to watch the Korean server that saw the birth of the kor-157 and the World Tree camp.<br/><br/>Hanho accessed the broadcast. Then, a message appeared on the TV screen.<br/><br/>-Please select the first ‘game item’!<br/><br/>*’Offensive side-Japanese server’ selects first.<br/><br/>It wasn’t just a simple battle. The victory of the game was decided under the rules given by the system.<br/><br/>-The Japanese server has selected No. 3 (Duel)’ event!<br/><br/>* The representatives of both sides must dispatch one ‘Great Warrior.’<br/><br/>* If you fail to respond, a ‘penalty’ will be given to the server.<br/><br/>* Upon victory, a ‘buff’ will be given to the winning server.<br/><br/>First of all, the Japanese side, who had the priority on the selection, chose confrontation, namely one-on-one duel. The Japanese ‘Great Warrior’ was selected first.<br/><br/>[Duel]<br/><br/>-Japanese server Great Warrior: Yamato’s Sword<br/><br/>-Korea Server Great Warrior: (Undecided)<br/><br/>The Japanese server ID “Yamato’s Sword” was Okata Akira, aka “Sword Saint”.<br/><br/>He appeared on the screen of the official channel that hundreds of thousands of people were watching now.<br/><br/>“I am Okata Akira, Honbucho of the Yamato Guild! Open your ears and listen to me, Korean server!”<br/><br/>In front of the main base of the Hwarang Guild, Akira, a tall man with four swords, shouted at the camera, staring into the camera.<br/><br/>“I’m not interested in small fries. I want to confront the leader of the World Tree camp! Come out here if you want to save the Korean server! Let me use my sword to prove how incompetent you are.”<br/><br/>With all the players from all over the world watching the live broadcast, he threw down the gauntlet to the Necromancer.<br/><br/>[Official Channel: LIVE] ‘Worldwide’ live broadcast of the Korean server vs. Japanese server (13,335,134 watching)<br/><br/>The war between Korea and Japan was taking place while the whole world was watching.<br/><br/>The ‘Hwarang Guild’ in Busan was devastated by the large-scale ambush by the Yamato Guild following the terrorist attacks of the Abyssal Breath.<br/><br/>As a result, the remaining players of the Hwarang Guild were in a very difficult situation, but they had to select one ‘Great Warrior’ to avoid the penalty.<br/><br/>-10 minutes left until the selection of the ‘Duel’ fighter.<br/><br/>* If you fail to respond, a ‘penalty’ will be given to the server.<br/><br/>And finally, someone’s name was on the list.<br/><br/>[Duel]<br/><br/>-Japanese server Great Warrior: Yamato’s Sword<br/><br/>-Korea server Great Warrior: Hyunmin Jang<br/><br/>* Both ‘Great Warriors’ must move to the designated place (BEXCO) in one hour.<br/><br/>* Once the duel begins, other battles are prohibited. (When you violate this rule, you will be declared ‘automatic death’.)<br/><br/>“What the heck? Sungwoo, isn’t he the leader of the Hwarang Guild?”<br/><br/>Like Hanho, who was watching the broadcast, Hyunmin, the leader of the Hwarang Guild, volunteered to confront his Japanese counterpart.<br/><br/>Currently, he was ranked 9th on the Korean server. He was ranked 5th in the ‘Raid Boss Monster Hunt Rankings’ and was responsible for raising the Hwarang Guild as the strongest force in the southern part of the Korean peninsula.<br/><br/>“It seems he wants to beat Akira and save his guild,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/>The Hwarang Guild was now driven into a dead end. With their retreat blocked, they could not hold out anymore if their buffs were taken away by their opponents.<br/><br/>So, it seemed that Hyunmin, the highest level holder of the Hwarang Guild, decided to throw down the gauntlet to Akira.<br/><br/>He must be stupid enough not to send one of his guild members to confront Akira.<br/><br/>An hour later, the two men faced each other in front of BEXCO, designated as a duel site.<br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/>Hyunmin was a “Paladin” armed with dark green plate armor. His bodyguards were also fully armed, showing that the Hwarang Guild was not a force they should make light of on the Korean server. </div><h2 id="chapter226">Chapter 226</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>The chat window of the official channel was getting hotter and hotter with the watchers reacting to the news that one of the “top ten strongmen” of the Korean server stepped forward.<br/><br/>“Um…’<br/><br/>However, even though Hyunmin approached, Akira, who already came to BEXCO Square in advance, looked sullen. He sat cross-legged on the bench, with his chin resting on his hand but didn’t even move.<br/><br/>Eventually, Hyunmin drew the big sword and opened his mouth first.<br/><br/>“I am Hyunmin Jang, the leader of the Hwarang Guild against which you mounted a terrorist attack.”<br/><br/>Hearing that, Akira yawned, totally ignoring him.<br/><br/>“Uh? Welcome, small fish of the Korean server!” Akira shouted.<br/><br/>“What the heck did you say?”<br/><br/>When Hyunmin reacted with a stiffened expression, Akira scorned him as if it was fun.<br/><br/>“Well, since you have decided to confront me to save your dying organization, let me commend you for that, so let me kill you without pain.”<br/><br/>Having said that, Akira stretched then picked up one of the four swords leaning against the bench.<br/><br/>“Oh, I forgot to tell you this, but I can’t guarantee I’ll kill you without any pain because I like to cut from the outside.”<br/><br/>Akira stretched again and stood up.<br/><br/>-The duel begins! (10 seconds to go)<br/><br/>The first one-on-one confrontation between the two began with the whole world watching them.<br/><br/>Hyunmin used enhancement skills unique to the Paladin. All kinds of magic circles were laid under his feet, causing multiple effects.<br/><br/>“Are you done?” Akira scorned him again, but he became calmer.<br/><br/>“No, I’m not done yet. My attack only ends when I kill you.”<br/><br/>“Hey, I’m sick and tired of such a cliche.”<br/><br/>The four-star Paladin occupation possessed solid defense and attack power, so anybody with that job had more advantages than his opponent in a one-on-one confrontation.<br/><br/>Because of that, Hyunmin never thought he would lose to him in this situation.<br/><br/>“You die!”<br/><br/>The two began to collide violently.<br/><br/>Clang! Thud!<br/><br/>But the roaring sound didn’t last long.<br/><br/>Hyunmin, ranked 8th in the Korean server, lost his left hand when Akira swung his sword for the fifth time. Without screaming at all, Hyunwmin quickly lunged at him with his sword, but Akira got around him and cut his ribs and knees successively by pointing at the small gap between his armor. The cut was very deep. However, he didn’t collapse because of Paladin’s defense power and spirit. He thought he could kill Akira with one stroke, no matter how he was attacked. Puck!<br/><br/>At that moment, his right ankle as well as its armor covering it was severed entirely.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>Did Akira possess skills that nullified Hyunmin’s defense power? Hyunmin, the paladin’s body, decorated with all kinds of magic, was cut by Akira’s sword.<br/><br/>Hyunmin couldn’t stand on the ground any longer. He lost his balance suddenly. Even before he collapsed, however, Akira lifted his sword and cut his neck right away.<br/><br/>All this happened so quickly that nobody watching this one-on-on match could figure out what happened.<br/><br/>Hyunmin’s fall also meant the impending fall of the Hwarang Guild.<br/><br/>“Uh? Is it true that he was already beheaded? I thought he was still fighting…”<br/><br/>Even though Akira won, Akira’s face was full of irritation.<br/><br/>-Japanese server “Yamato’s Sword” wins!<br/><br/>-The ‘victory buff’ is given to the Japanese server!<br/><br/>* Increase attack power for 2 hours (+30%)<br/><br/>The players on the other servers cheered for the strength of the Japanese samurai, but the Korean server was thrown into chaos as well as shock. It was even more shocking to them because the 8th strongest man on the Korean server lost to his Japanese counterpart.<br/><br/>Akira put the sword on his shoulder while looking at the drone camera, the official channel’s camera, capturing all these scenes from the sky.<br/><br/>“Hey, kor-157, if you are watching this fight, listen to me carefully. I will be waiting for you while cutting open your colleague’s stomach.”<br/><br/>-From now on, ‘Free Battle’ begins for 2 hours.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this? Sungwoo, I can’t believe this. What happened a moment ago is real, right?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Even the players of the World Tree camp could not believe their eyes. They could feel keenly that the Japanese master samurai, Akira, perfected his sword skills in action.<br/><br/>Shortly after the shocking showdown was over, Sungwoo received two messages. The first came from Junghoon. Junghoon said he also took this Korea-Japan event seriously, so he would prepare for the contingency situation after the Japanese server occupied Busan. He seemed to want Sungwoo to join his operation.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, how should I reply to him?”<br/><br/>“I’m sorry, but please tell him that we’re going to go to Busan soon. If he wants to join us, ask him to let us know.”<br/><br/>The other message came from the Hunter Company’s President Baek. He even came directly to the Suwon village.<br/><br/>“Whew! Necromancer, I have successfully carried out the mission you gave me.”<br/><br/>Finally, Sungwoo headed out to Bush to confront the Japanese server.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The quest of the Korean-Japan war drove the entire Korean server, not to mention the Hwarang Guild and the World Tree camp, into an emergency because they would never know how far the repercussions would reach if they lost to the Japanese server.<br/><br/>However, as the history of the countries’ fights shows, the Japanese server wouldn’t be able to predict an easy victory.<br/><br/>Therefore, Jungwoo thought that he was not going to ignore what was happening in Busan. He summoned the ranking officers of his allied forces and ordered a total mobilization.<br/><br/>“We must be wary of foreign servers influencing us within our servers. Call your troops right away and mobilize all the allied forces to prepare for the Japanese server’s attack.”<br/><br/>“Okay!”<br/><br/>“We must be ready to go to Busan in an emergency. If the Hwarang Guild holds out longer than we think, we may have to build a line of defense with them.”<br/><br/>At this point, some ranking members questioned Junghoon’s direction. Among them was Kangyun Lee, the leader of the Daehakro group.<br/><br/>“Uh? Are you now saying that we should join hands with the Hwarang Guild? As you know, they belong to the Demon camp. Of course, the situation is so urgent, so…”<br/><br/>As Kangyun said, the Hwarang Guild in Busan was a member of the Demon camp, so they were the hostile forces in the eyes of Junghoon’s forces who belonged to the Angel camp.<br/><br/>In some respects, even if Kangyun thought their defeat would not be a loss to the Angel camp, nobody could blame him for his selfish thinking.<br/><br/>Junghoon shook his head firmly.<br/><br/>“This is not a matter of simply joining hands with them. Don’t you think the system is driving the whole Korean server into destruction?”<br/><br/>“Ah…”<br/><br/>After the World Quest was issued, the system seemed to force other servers to take hostile action against the Korean server.<br/><br/>“As you know, we need to save the Korean server for us to win and survive.”<br/><br/>“To save the Korean server? Oh, I understand.”<br/><br/>Junghoon turned his head to his deputy commander Minhum, “Minhum, tell the players of the demon camp in Uijeongbu who surrendered a while ago that if they participate in this battle, we will waive their detention period and pay the legitimate compensation for their efforts.”<br/><br/>“Sure!”<br/><br/>To save the Korean server, Junghoon intended to mobilize as many players as possible within the Korean server because even if he didn’t need them right now, he would need contingency troops if he confronted the worst situation someday.<br/><br/>After Junghoon wrapped up the meeting, he still couldn’t stop thinking about one thing.<br/><br/>‘Why is the system trying to make the Korean server the prey of foreign players around the world? Just because of the emergence of the Third camp?”<br/><br/>He could not know the reason, but in his mind, he thought there might come a situation where the Angel, Demon, and the World Tree camp would have to join forces to confront the foreign intruders.<br/><br/>‘If that happens, we three camps have to be united, which is not impossible.”<br/><br/>Their combination could produce a positive influence, which was also Junghoon’s goal from the beginning.<br/><br/>His goal was not to pit each camp against another but to integrate them as a strong joint force to confront this mysterious phenomenon.<br/><br/>‘But even in a moment like this, the real problem is…’<br/><br/>The biggest problem was the Angel statue. </div><h2 id="chapter227">Chapter 227</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>-A camp quest (special) has been issued.<br/><br/>[Camp Quest (Special)]<br/><br/>-Title: Take Glory in the Chaos<br/><br/>-Type: Assassination<br/><br/>-Goal: Assassinate kor-157<br/><br/>-Reward: Rank score<br/><br/>*After the war between the Korean-Japanese servers broke out, the Korean server fell into great chaos. Chaos provides an opportunity for you to boldly cut out the rotten parts. Take order and draw your sword.<br/><br/>* In case of non-compliance, your ‘rank score’ will be reduced. (If your non-compliance is repeated, you may be excluded from various camp benefits.)<br/><br/>“Damn it…”<br/><br/>Frowning at the message, Junghoon stared at the Angel statue hidden in the deepest part of Yeongdeungpo Station.<br/><br/>The Angel statue with four wings was one cut above other Angel statues. Therefore, Junghoon expected to receive a higher level quest than this, but the quest didn’t take its eyes off kor-157, namely Sungwoo.<br/><br/>This quest wasn’t helpful to Junghoon’s purpose at all.<br/><br/>“Maybe what Sungwoo said back then was…”<br/><br/>He recalled what Sungwoo had told him on the day he destroyed the first Angel statue, expressing what he felt frankly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon began to feel at some point that the names of the Absolute Races were a shackle.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The last bastion of the Hwarang Guild was inside a university campus in downtown Busan.<br/><br/>Of course, unlike the general campus, it was filled with iron gates made of magic metal and barbed wires. The Hwarang Guild built it as a temporary shelter in case of an emergency.<br/><br/>That’s why they could hold out there until now.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>An ear-splitting roar was ringing across the campus. It was the noise of invaders tearing through the front door that served as a protective shield, made of magic metal.<br/><br/>“We can’t hold out here anymore. They’re closing in on us from all directions.”<br/><br/>Somebody brought tragic news to the commanding post set up at the university headquarters.<br/><br/>Since they already suffered so much damage, they could no longer resist the enemy’s attack. Almost half of the guild members could not play their role properly after taking in the ‘Breath of Abyss.’<br/><br/>“If our leader Hyunmin had not collapsed helplessly, we could have broken through the enemy line…’<br/><br/>Their leader Hyunmin Jang was killed by the Japanese sword master Akira in the one-on-one fight, so their morale was completely broken after that duel.<br/><br/>They couldn’t open their mouths, their expressions were somber for a while. There was no hero nor hope for those who were left behind.<br/><br/>One of the ranking members of the Hwarang Guild came up with an idea.<br/><br/>“If we can hold out a little longer, we will have the chance to choose the ‘next option.’ It’s our turn to choose it, so let’s try to flee during the breathing time right after choosing the type of fight.”<br/><br/>What he suggested was to seek the chance to retreat by making use of the loophole in the rules of the Korean-Japanese war, for another fight was prohibited while the ‘duel’ was going on.<br/><br/>“Can we escape during that time? Isn’t it too short…”<br/><br/>“Well, don’t you think that’s the only way for now?”<br/><br/>They eventually devised an escape plan which was close to suicide.<br/><br/>Somebody came in with an urgent message.<br/><br/>“Man, we’re in big trouble!”<br/><br/>“What happened this time?”<br/><br/>To try that plan, they had to hold out until they would choose the next option, but it seemed almost impossible to carry out such a plan.<br/><br/>“They already tore down the front door shield!”<br/><br/>Massive pieces of metal debris fell over the campus, breaking down the walls before being dumped in a parking lot.<br/><br/>“They are now intruding onto the campus!”<br/><br/>They could not stop the enemies. When hundreds of heavily armed assault troops stormed like a herd of water buffalo, the security guards at the front door were destroyed in an instant.<br/><br/>“We’re going to be killed!”<br/><br/>“Yeah, you’re right… We have done our best.”<br/><br/>The remaining Hwarang Guild members had no choice but to give up, staring blankly at the hundreds of intruders outside the window.<br/><br/>“Damn it. I feel so ashamed to be killed like this…” One of them muttered.<br/><br/>However, his lament did not fit the situation. How could he say he felt ashamed, not scared, in this precarious moment?<br/><br/>“What do you mean?”<br/><br/>The man responded, his face filled with anger, “What I mean is the whole world must have watched the Japs destroying us when we could not counter-attack them. That makes me ashamed.”<br/><br/>“I agree.”<br/><br/>“Besides, our leader was killed. Maybe foreign players were thrilled to see this. God damn ninjas and samurai!”<br/><br/>He was very unhappy the Hwarang Guild lost to Japan in the Korean-Japanese server wars. As he said, the official channel, which was currently being watched by 10 million people, was overflowing with comments posted by those deeply immersed in ‘Japanese fantasy’ figures such as ninjas and samurai.<br/><br/>He could not do anything other than lament about the miserable situation the Hwarang Guild was in.<br/><br/>“What’s the point of complaining about our weakness?”<br/><br/>That was the right answer to their current problem.<br/><br/>“Damned bastards! My grandfather also died under Japanese colonial rule, but I have never thought I would also be killed by Japs. I wish lightning would fall over their heads.”<br/><br/>At that moment, a stroke of lightning fell.<br/><br/>Kwagwagwagwagwa-<br/><br/>Dozens of arrows rained down on the hundreds of Japanese intruders walking up to them through the road leading to the main gate they broke through. They were not ordinary arrows. Instead, they were like iron thunderbolts, full of magical power.<br/><br/>“Damn it! What the heck is all this?”<br/><br/>The Japanese troops were embarrassed by the unexpected arrow attacks, but they suffered little damage thanks to their heavy armor. However, they had to stop and tightened their security.<br/><br/>“Is this a trap?”<br/><br/>“Lift your shield! It’s just an arrow!”<br/><br/>In the next moment, there was a spate of arrows flying at them again.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>Dozens of arrows exploded like dynamite and swept over them. This time the arrows caused much more damage to them because they were stuck in their shields and armor. Some of them exploded under their feet.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>“Help! Ahhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>The Japanese troops, who had entered the gate triumphantly, stopped.<br/><br/>“What happened?”<br/><br/>“What’s up? It’s not our attack, right?”<br/><br/>It was somebody’s counterattack that even the Hwarang guild did not know about because they had already given up fighting.<br/><br/>The Hwarang Guild members turned their heads and started looking for the place the arrows came from. Soon, they discovered something was moving on the rooftop of a university building.<br/><br/>“That’s…”<br/><br/>It was the fire rocket arrow.<br/><br/>A pair of giant wings spread across the sky, with a bone-made monster raising its long neck. A monster arose on the battlefield. Black smoke rose from its back, and soon, dozens of Bone Wyverns poured out and scattered in a fan shape toward the sky. The sun disappeared in seconds.<br/><br/>It was natural the eyes of the players around the world became fixated on the scene.<br/><br/>At the same time, there was a moment of silence.<br/><br/>“Wow, he’s here!”<br/><br/>“That man has come to save us!”<br/><br/>What’s more, there were some other powerful weapons such as two Iron Maces of Lightning and five Ballistas.<br/><br/>The Bone Wyverns darkened the ground with their wings, while the fixed turrets were pulled tightly behind their backs.<br/><br/>“Everybody, get ready to shoot!”<br/><br/>Suddenly, dozens of players, who appeared from all over the rooftops, began to aim repeating crossbows toward the incoming Japanese intruders.<br/><br/>-Your body functions are weakened due to unknown energy.<br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-3)<br/><br/>With every turret being pulled tight, someone raised himself above the head of the massive monster, Bone Wyvern Alpha Male, that blocked the sunlight from reaching the ground.<br/><br/>He was wearing a dark green robe, holding a giant scythe, and looked like a black wolf.<br/><br/>His figure was familiar to the Korean server players, but it was unknown and bizarre to the world.<br/><br/>The next moment, Korean players who had been quiet for a while on the official channel’s chat window began to get thrilled and upload posts one after the other.<br/><br/>They said that the main unit of the Korean server finally arrived in Busan and the Japanese intruders were finished. </div><h2 id="chapter228">Chapter 228</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>[Official Channel: LIVE] ‘Worldwide’ live broadcast of the war between the Korean server and the Japanese server (14,115,135 watching)<br/><br/>Over 14 million players were watching the fighting scenes around the world.<br/><br/>Since they watched it on the third-party server, the war between the Korean and Japanese servers, which took place all of a sudden, was nothing but one of the few interesting sources of entertainment in this boring and painful world.<br/><br/>They randomly posted joking chats even when a terrible war game was going on in real-time, and bet on which side would win.<br/><br/>Was the system conscious of such a reaction? The system opened up a mini-game to the viewers.<br/><br/>[Victory Prediction]<br/><br/>It wasn’t a bet. The system announced it would give a special prize by drawing to those players who answered the correct answer, the result of this game was too obvious.<br/><br/>[Victory Prediction]<br/><br/>Naturally, the Japan server won overwhelming votes. Japan has always appeared strong in the minds of people around the world. Compared to the Korean server, it was natural they thought that the Japanese server had a great chance of winning.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the influence of the Japanese subculture was enormous beyond imagination.<br/><br/>Elements of traditional Japanese culture such as ninjas, samurai, and shoguns were promoted through Japanese animation and fixated as something like a fantasy in the minds of Westerners.<br/><br/>However, since such creatures were fighting in the real world, the so-called Japanese addicts could not help but have a crush on them.<br/><br/>In particular, they got carried away with Akira, Yamato’s Sword’s brilliant activities in the one-on-one duel, as he showed samurai in the best light like a being from fantasy.<br/><br/>[Real time chat]<br/><br/>─ J.J.P (USA-1): Oh God! Can anyone explain what I have seen now? I can’t believe I have seen a samurai in action! Thanks, JPN players!<br/><br/>─ 7ate9 (USA-2): Yeah, chop them all! I know that’s your race’s national specialty, isn’t it?<br/><br/>─ amigo41 (BRA): The country of martial arts is different. One day we will confront you guys, but I can’t guarantee who’s going to win. You guys are great.<br/><br/>─ Te creo (CUB): Awesome. That’s all I can say.<br/><br/>─ きんほし(JPN): WWWW It’s beyond my expectations.<br/><br/>─ DaveHHH (NZL): I support you. Keep going!<br/><br/>In other words, the chat window was overflowing with comments extolling the performance of the Japanese server, while the players of the Korean server kept silent until the Necromancer and his allies appeared.<br/><br/>The moment when the Japanese troops who broke through the main gate were destroyed by dozens of explosive arrows, the huge wings of the Bone Wyvern Alpha Male spread over the building, and the person in question, called kor-157, appeared, the world’s perception of the Korean server began to change.<br/><br/>Since the Japanese server players intruded, determined to wage a war with the Korean server, they were thoroughly prepared.<br/><br/>‘We should not make light of them. Although they didn’t go through a major war, they kept hunting monsters,’ Sungwoo thought.<br/><br/>They were armed with excellent items. They also learned how to receive effective synergy through appropriate party combinations. In other words, they were not weak.<br/><br/>‘It seems they have done some background investigation about me because their main target is me.’<br/><br/>They targeted the Korean server to fight kor-157, the Necromancer. Therefore, they investigated the tactics used by the Necromancer and prepared for them accordingly.<br/><br/>– Caution! A ‘poisonous cloud’ is formed in the affected area.<br/><br/>For example, when the “poisonous cloud” that crippled many Chinese troops during the battle in Taiwan appeared in the sky, forward soldiers on the tall buildings began to shout.<br/><br/>“Rain warning!”<br/><br/>“Rain warning!”<br/><br/>“Everyone put on a raincoat right now! The dark clouds formed over his head can sprinkle poisonous rain over us!”<br/><br/>Warning voices echoed from all sides. Then, all Japanese players started putting on thick vinyl hoods. Although they were not a perfect shield, they were the maximum defense available for now.<br/><br/>“If you notice a body, clear it right away! Otherwise, it will explode!”<br/><br/>They were also conscious of the corpse explosion, so whenever they found corpses, they picked the corpses right away and threw them far away.<br/><br/>“Watch out for the sky!”<br/><br/>“Air response!”<br/><br/>They also prepared a response system to cope with the Necromancer’s main attack, ‘Aerial Dominance’, and practiced it.<br/><br/>“As soon as the Bone Wyvern comes down, spread the protective shield right away and focus the freezing magic on both wings of the Bone Wyvern!”<br/><br/>By simply blocking the movement of the wings, they could minimize the threat of the Bone Wyvern because if the monster could not control his direction and balance, he could not mount a proper attack.<br/><br/>Their systematic training in preparation for the Necromancer’s attack was obvious to everybody.<br/><br/>“Gather together! We are going to move as a group systematically!”<br/><br/>It was a tactic that belied common sense that they decided to move along the uphill slope of the two-lane road as a single group.<br/><br/>“If there is a big impact, never scatter!”<br/><br/>Given all the players who were destroyed by the Necromancers so far, lots of them were killed because they gathered in one place.<br/><br/>However, these Japanese players made even larger formations. Standing shoulder-to-shoulder, they were blocking AOE attacks with their shields and magic.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was not agitated by them at all.<br/><br/>‘I think they have been preparing a lot, but all they can do is delay my attack for a few more minutes.’<br/><br/>No matter how well prepared they were, the Necromancer could freely attack them for one hour while his Lich and Anubis status were activated.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>If the huge skeletons kept resurrecting despite their killings, it would be impossible for even the toughest tankers to stop them forever.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>The troll skeletons swung blunt weapons made of bones. Those who received their attack could not keep their balances.<br/><br/>“You can’t stop me anymore.”<br/><br/>Eventually, the Japanese players would show their weakness because they could not be resurrected like the trolls.<br/><br/>“Clear the bodies quickly! Hurry up!”<br/><br/>The gap in their strength was widening as time went on.<br/><br/>“Fill the gap!”<br/><br/>They had only one hour. During this one hour of fighting, the Japanese players had no choice but to suffer unilateral damage, which was a tough choice for them.<br/><br/>So, they chose the next best option: assassinating the Necromancer.<br/><br/>Until now, no one has succeeded in assassinating him, but they wanted to avoid the hellish fighting with him for a full hour.<br/><br/>“Be careful on your side!”<br/><br/>Moreover, the Necromancer didn’t attack only from the sky and front.<br/><br/>“Something is climbing the wall!”<br/><br/>“What are those terrible things?”<br/><br/>At that moment, hundreds of Japanese players were climbing a two-lane uphill road with buildings on both sides. This was the best fighting stage for the undead, which were optimized for the three-dimensional movement, such as ‘ghouls’ and ‘giant Jannabi skeletons.’<br/><br/>“Drop them!”<br/><br/>“Be careful, you might be dragged… Ahhh!”<br/><br/>That was just the beginning of the attack of the undead.<br/><br/>Goo-gung! Goo Goo Goo!<br/><br/>The noise of something scratching the ground began to get closer and closer to the Japanese players like an earthquake. It was heard from over the building on the right.<br/><br/>“No way!”<br/><br/>“This is that monster! Giant snake Imoogi!”<br/><br/>Since they shared the relevant information early on, the Japanese players instantly realized what they would encounter from the strong vibration.<br/><br/>“But that Imoogi can hardly move around here because of all the buildings here.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, that Imoogi made a mistake!”<br/><br/>It was impossible for Bone Imoogi, a super-large monster dozens of meters long, to move around downtown, but the monster snake appeared at last.<br/><br/>Gugugugugugu!<br/><br/>“The snake came out!”<br/><br/>“Avoid the snake!”<br/><br/>Its giant head popped out of the alley on the right, cut off the middle of the Japanese players’ formation; then, he put his head back into the alley across the street.<br/><br/>The giant snake moved with tremendous speed and weight, like a subway running out of one tunnel and entering another.<br/><br/>“Just stay still until the giant snake passes by! He can’t even turn his body!”<br/><br/>Bone Imoogi was powerful enough to push a forest away by swinging his long body, but it was a different matter if the giant snake could destroy a concrete building six stories tall.<br/><br/>“If the snake attacks us from the front, we can use the massive freezing magic at the same time.”<br/><br/>In other words, they already set up a plan to counterattack the giant snake, but what happened was not what they expected at all.<br/><br/>Bone Imoogi didn’t keep passing. He blocked the middle of the Japanese players’ formation as they labored up the hill and stopped before them.<br/><br/>“He stopped!”<br/><br/>“What the heck? Is he dead?”<br/><br/>Of course, Bone Imoogi wasn’t because Sungwoo was controlling all his subordinate spirits including the giant snake.<br/><br/>‘Now is the golden time to attack them!’ </div><h2 id="chapter229">Chapter 229</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>“Now is the time!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo sent Bone Imoogi to disrupt the formation of the Japanese troops and break them into two groups. As he intended, the Japanese troops were split into two groups, with the Bone Imoogi straddling them in the middle.<br/><br/>However, the Japanese troops had no time to notice such an attack and prepare for it because there was a huge shadow cast over them.<br/><br/>“Watch your head above!”<br/><br/>“Aerial alert!”<br/><br/>Bone Wyverns flew in at once and began to throw huge rocks toward the Japanese soldiers who were on the upper side of the Bone Imoogi.<br/><br/>“Shield!”<br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>The flying rocks were threatening, but they blocked it by spreading a large-scale shield. That was not Sungwoo’s intention.<br/><br/>‘Manufacture golem!’<br/><br/>The rocks thrown by Bone Wyverns crushed the asphalt roads, causing the soil hidden underneath it to come out.<br/><br/>Sungwoo used the skill of Golem Manufacture (Skilled).<br/><br/>-You have summoned a golem (Mud).<br/><br/>-You have summoned a golem (Mud).<br/><br/>Two squishy mud creatures rose among the Japanese soldiers. They were massive monsters, as high as ten meters and weighing several tons.<br/><br/>“Golem!”<br/><br/>Golems weren’t easy to deal with. Swords or spears could not damage their sticky mud body and their composition canceled 80% of magic damage.<br/><br/>As a result, they could inflict huge damages on the Japanese soldiers.<br/><br/>“What the heck are they doing now?”<br/><br/>But the golems didn’t seem to be interested in them. They just went downhill and got stuck on the Bone Imoogi that broke the formation of the Japanese soldiers.<br/><br/>They just squashed their arms, legs, and body between the bones of the giant snake then stayed still.<br/><br/>“Shit, what the hell these monsters are doing…?”<br/><br/>The Japanese soldiers didn’t know anything about this kind of strange action by the Necromancer’s undead, but they felt an ominous feeling.<br/><br/>In the meantime, it continued to rain. As time passed, more and more rain poured out from the purple dark clouds in the sky.<br/><br/>“Uh!”<br/><br/>Only then did they begin to notice the poison water flowing was rising around their feet.<br/><br/>“Rainwater is collecting!”<br/><br/>“Toxic rainwater is rising on the ground. Watch your feet!”<br/><br/>When they lowered their heads, they found the poison water was flowing like a stream.<br/><br/>Ramps in Busan were notorious for being steep. The pouring rainwater was supposed to flow along the asphalt into the lowlands.<br/><br/>But now, the middle of the ramps was blocked by the Bone Imoogi and mud golems like an embankment. To make matters worse, the unmaintained sewerage system had long lost its function, so the rainwater on the roads didn’t drain quickly.<br/><br/>Eventually, the rainwater began to rise slowly under the Japanese soldiers’ feet.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh! My feet hurt!”<br/><br/>“Poison is seeping into my feet! Give me an antidote….”<br/><br/>Poisoned by the rising water, Japanese soldiers screamed in pain. They were wearing heavy and thick plastic raincoats to avoid the poison, but they could not do anything about the poison coming up from below.<br/><br/>“Our advance party has been isolated! We have to break through. Everyone, prepare explosion magic!”<br/><br/>“Oh no! Watch out the wall!<br/><br/>Those in the rear tried to break through the bodies of the Bone Imoogi and mud golems, but they were stopped from doing anything by the ghouls and giant Jannabi skeletons hanging on the walls.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was now ready to deal a fatal blow.<br/><br/>“Now is the right time. Block the alley!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo gave the direction to someone through the radio item. Then, some of the Bone Wyverns in the rear began to move. There were six wizard players behind them.<br/><br/>“Freeze them!”<br/><br/>“Ice Wall!”<br/><br/>They were freeze series wizards. The moment Bone Wyverns flew low, they used magic to freeze the edges of the two-lane road and the entrance to the alley.<br/><br/>In other words, they completely sealed off the gap through which the rainwater could drain.<br/><br/>Have you ever seen how fast water rises in a steep valley? Rising water always sweeps, swallows, and collapses everything beyond people’s imagination.<br/><br/>Kwaguaguagua!<br/><br/>While the rainwater filled with strong poison streamed down the hill, it began to rise at a tremendous rate. When the poisoned rainwater rose above their ankles, all the Japanese troops isolated in front were poisoned.<br/><br/>“Oh, my God… I can’t move…”<br/><br/>Exposed to the poison like that, they could hardly fight, and their strategy of being united to cope with the monsters also collapsed.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Death Response’ begins in that area.<br/><br/>Wuuuuuuuuuuh!<br/><br/>To make matters worse, a horde of zombies popped out among them.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>“What? What? Damn it!”<br/><br/>Twenty-five zombies jumped out of the water, grabbed the legs and arms of the Japanese soldiers like water ghosts, and dragged them into the water.<br/><br/>They fought against each other in the rising poisonous water, but a large number of Japanese soldiers drank the poison through their noses.<br/><br/>“Kuheeeeeeeee!”<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>On the rooftop where flying weapons were installed, the players of the World Tree camp were watching the scene closely, waiting for Sungwoo’s order.<br/><br/>“Yes, it’s good that these Japs, intruders of Korea dating back to ancient times, get to taste the water here.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo ordered, “Now is the time! Fire!”<br/><br/>“Understood! Break down the embankment with the Iron Maces of Lightning!”<br/><br/>The Iron Maces of Lightning, fully loaded, aiming at the Japanese soldiers, emitted a blue flash.<br/><br/>The huge magic bullet hit the dam and the Imoogi’s waist and the mud golems, which had been blocking the rainwater coming down to the downhill, were blown away, opening the waterway for the raging current.<br/><br/>Kwaguaguagua!<br/><br/>A tremendous roar began to sweep downhill with the water.<br/><br/>Many Japanese troops, who had already noticed the operation, were hiding in the alley, but those isolated at the forefront were dragged down the waterway and met their last moments.<br/><br/>“Wow, look at the strong current of the water!”<br/><br/>But unfortunately, their fighting was over at that point.<br/><br/>-Stop Free Battle!<br/><br/>The two-hour free battle’ has ended, and the time for event selection has finally come.<br/><br/>-Select the second ‘battle event’!<br/><br/>* ‘Defender-It’s the Korea server’s turn to select.<br/><br/>* Time remaining until selection (00:04:59)<br/><br/>Now, it was time for the Korean server to select.<br/><br/>-The ‘captain’ of the defender (Korean server) has been changed.<br/><br/>* New captain: kor-157<br/><br/>The Hwarang Guild, whose leader was the captain of the first event, handed over their authority to Sungwoo. Since they could not continue to fight any longer, it was natural they let Sungwoo take over the leadership.<br/><br/>The Japanese server’s swordmaster, Akira, appeared again.<br/><br/>“Hey! Necromancer!”<br/><br/>The drone of the official channel began to move at his thunderous shouting that resonated across the battlefield. The drone lit his face because his provocation would certainly draw the interest of the viewers as much as it could.<br/><br/>“I believe you have come out at my request, so let me…”<br/><br/>Akira drew a sword and shouted, “Let’s have a duel! So, choose Duel!”<br/><br/>He urged the Necromancer to have a duel with him by choosing the event option Duel.<br/><br/>“Prove your abilities and your identity to the world!”<br/><br/>As soon as he finished talking, a shadow was cast over his head. Bone Wyvern Alpha Male approached him. Looking down on him, Sungwoo scorned him.<br/><br/>“Duel?”<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo stretched out his index finger and chose one item.<br/><br/>-The Korean server has selected ‘No. 1 event, All-out War!<br/><br/>* The battle zone is limited after one minute!<br/><br/>* Every 10 minutes, the battle zone will be reduced!<br/><br/>* The all-out war ends in 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t accept Akira’s request.<br/><br/>Akira’s face looked gloomy at that message.<br/><br/>“What the heck! Damn it! Necromancer! Come down right away and fight me! Are you scared of me?”<br/><br/>No matter how desperately Akira shouted at him, Sungwoo raised one of his fingers with a relaxed expression.<br/><br/>“There is only one thing I can prove.”<br/><br/>The black scythe he was holding had a black wave at that moment. It was the Evil Spirit Bombing.<br/><br/>“My point is if you enter this land recklessly, you can’t survive.”<br/><br/>Having said that, Sungwoo swung the Grim Reaper towards Akira’s head. Black souls shot out in a straight line, covering his body.<br/><br/>Gu-gu-gu-gu-gung-<br/><br/>The soul swelled, spreading its black wave then crushed everything around him.<br/><br/>Akira disappeared from the screen of the official channel, with only Sungwoo left behind.<br/><br/>“Now, let’s continue with what I have just started.”<br/><br/>-The battle zone has been set. (Total of 3,000m²)<br/><br/>Soon, a red dome was placed over the heads of the two camps.<br/><br/>A stadium where they could not escape was prepared.<br/><br/>-The battle zone will be reduced in 10 minutes. (-500m²)<br/><br/>The battle was destined to be a little stickier. </div><h2 id="chapter230">Chapter 230</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Players around the world watching the scene through the official channel witnessed something like a “war movie” changing to a “slasher movie,” which featured the battle zone shrinking gradually, monsters that never died, and demonic beings with no mercy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Help me!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the victims screaming in pain, the fight between them was so terrible and bizarre.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Japanese soldiers had nothing like a fighting strategy. With everything collapsing, all they could do was struggle desperately to survive until the all-out war was over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The battle zone will be reduced in 60 seconds. (-500m²)<br/><br/><br/><br/>What was left behind was the sound of bone bumping inside the shrinking dome, and the invaders dying with regret while retreating.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It didn’t take too long for Sungwoo to get rid of the Japanese remnants. The fight was over before Sungwoo summoned the ‘Grim Reaper’ and ‘The Power of Anubis’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have chased and killed them. They are running to the north.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have also killed them all in the west.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The whole world could not help but be astonished because the advance party of about 2,000 Japanese troops who set foot on the Korean soil was annihilated. They were killed by one Korean player in less than 40 minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the only one, the commander of the Japanese army, swordmaster Akira Okata was different from others.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Yeah, he is a monster. I have no choice but to admit it.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He survived the Necromancer’s ‘Evil Spirit Bombing’. His survival was abnormal, but after surviving the bomb, he was holding out for the remaining time while blocking the undead’s endless attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only a little while ago, he struck back dozens of arrows, stepping on the thighs of the troll skeleton, and grabbed his ribs. Then, he bounced up and cut the cervical vertebrae of the troll skeleton at once<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he cut the heads of two ghouls charging down from the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>All this happened in just a few seconds, but this was repeated for dozens of minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grim Reaper remaining time (00:14:29)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Anubis remaining time (00:14:30)<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I am afraid I can’t finish this fight so quickly.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t step forward recklessly. He dispatched a lot of undead to kill Akira, but the latter broke through the siege and escaped by widening the distance with them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even if Sungwoo stepped forward now, he would not defeat Akira. Sungwoo would have to be ready to have his head cut by such a strong swordsman like Akira.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could know it while watching the highly skillful Jisu using her sword. Those using the sword freely knew how to deal a fatal blow to their opponents.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘As expected, this guy is dangerous.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo canceled Anubis to save the remaining time of Awakening and his deity status and withdrew the undead, and as a result, the tedious confrontation between them continued for a while.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo? Is it okay to leave him alone like that? He seems a little tired, so why don’t you kill him right away?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Just leave him alone because we have won.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Japanese soldiers were annihilated except for Akira.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Korean server virtually won the fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Korean server wins the all-out war with the Japanese server!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Victory buff’ is given to the Korean server!<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Increase defense power for one hour (+30%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, the all-out war was over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-From now on, ‘Free Battle’ begins for 1 hour.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s all over because our enemies were wiped out, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Probably. Phew…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The survivors of the Hwarang Guild on the Korean server side were relieved. When they gave up everything, they were saved by the unexpected reinforcement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, we have won because the Japanese soldiers were killed except for that one crazy swordsman…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What a relief! I never expected that the Necromancer would come here so soon!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bet! Come to think of it, he is a good man. Don’t you think we have to switch to the World Tree camp?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But contrary to their expectations, the war was not over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Not yet! Watch the broadcast!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The official channel’s broadcasting drone was still flying over Busan. That meant the war was not over yet.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And now the screen of the broadcast showed the coast of Busan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>More precisely, the drone was showing dozens of ships off the coast of Busan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How many warships are there?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are they all Japanese warships?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Japanese reinforcement troops arrived via sea. Since the coastline batteries had been disabled, there was no way to prevent them from landing on Korean soil.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everyone’s eyes turned to Sungwoo. Everything depended on him, but even Sungwoo was in agony at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I’ve got only 14 minutes to use the Anubis status. It’s not reasonable to fight them now.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Until now, he always destroyed his enemies within an hour. However, if the Japanese troops attacked massively back to back, he could not handle them alone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If I can’t function properly, we are overwhelmingly inferior.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The number of World Tree camp players that Sungwoo took with him were only 30. Even if he combined the Hwarang Guild members, they were numerically inferior to the Japanese fighters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In this situation, Sungwoo and his party would not be able to escape after his Awakening and deity status ended in14 minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Does it mean we have to give up Busan?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could not think straight at the moment. What he got was one hour of free battle. After that, the Japanese server would try to fight again by selecting the ‘fighting mode,’ regardless of whether it is a one-on-one duel or other forms of fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Necromancer?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the executive members of the Hwarang Guild came to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Currently, the representative of the Korean server side is you, Necromancer. We will follow your order.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Give us an order, please!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were full of determination, but what Sungwoo said to them was quite surprising.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think I have to abandon Busan. Prepare to retreat north, so guide us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo came to such a conclusion after a long thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? Retreat?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes. Hurry up, please.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were more than 1,000 survivors of the Hwarang Guild, but most of them inhaled the Abyss of Breath, so they could not fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Moreover, more than 2,000 Japanese troops were annihilated by Sungwoo. This meant the Japanese reinforcement troops would be several times as many as them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I need a reinforcement force.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, this was not Sungwoo’s area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I have to widen the distance with them by all means, so we can fight them again after 24 hours.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players of the World Tree hurried to prepare for a retreat. They collected the flying weapons and stored them in the inventory. They monitored the surroundings carefully while preparing to retreat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even after the great victory, there was nervousness and anxiety in Sungwoo and his allies on the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hurry up! They have already landed!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There are so many injured people here. I don’t know how to take them…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, somebody shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Necromancer! Something is flying from the southern sky!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked to the south. There was a bunch of something hanging in the orange sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hundreds of large kites were flying, riding in the sea breeze carrying ninjas.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Airstrike!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Even the human beast monsters are moving in the north!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The troops of the “Evolution Society”, who Sungwoo forgot for a long time, began to move again. They were only a few people, but they could spray “Breath of Abyss” to block the streets.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What should we do, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m afraid we can’t retreat in this situation.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I guess so.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wasn’t there any way to fight them at all? Sungwoo realized that he was in big trouble.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Can I open the Demon’s Door?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>If he approached the main unit of the enemies and opened the Demon’s Door, they would be busy fighting the Demon’s Door without paying attention to Sungwoo and his allies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But that option was Sungwoo’s final card. At the same time, it was something like a mutual destruction card.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and players of the World Tree camp may somehow survive, but the survivors of the Hwarang Guild, where there were many wounded, would be annihilated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Prepare for battle once more!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ready for battle!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo decided he would have to resist by all means. </div><h2 id="chapter231">Chapter 231</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Arrows and magic were shot one after another from the roof of a university building. In the dark sky, fireworks and colorful magic exploded, immersing the whole campus in a dark color.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pop! Pop! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Japanese ninja units landed near the campus and were approaching across the ground. They were shooting arrows with explosives and flying pigeons with bombs to create an opportunity to approach the allies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Five ninjas are coming from the right!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Five ninjas attacked after climbing over the railing. They were strong enough to easily wipe out shooters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way, no way!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Minsok, the skeleton knight with green eyes, was protecting the shooters of the World Tree camp behind them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You guys can’t climb over it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He jumped off the floor so violently there was a dent in the urethane floor of the roof and blocked the ninja at the forefront with a shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how competent the ninja was, he could not avoid Minsok’s adroit attack. As if the ninja was run over by a truck, he bounced off the railing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, Minsok swung his big sword and cut the second ninja’s chest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ninjas who followed dispersed in all directions, trying to pass by Minsok, but Minsok’s black chains stretched out like tentacles and entangled their limbs. When they could not get out of his chains, they were killed miserably like crucian carp caught on a fishing line.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You guys can never climb over this wall!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Before becoming the Death Knight, he always led a passive life, protecting somebody behind his back, but he was different now. He never allowed anybody to escape by getting past him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“More ninjas are charging at us from the right!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hearing that, he dropped the black chain. Then, he turned his head and called someone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, little boy!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Orun appeared out of nowhere. Minsok wrapped Orun’s body with a chain, then threw him to the right as forcefully as possible like a top tied to a string.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bung-boo-woong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Three ninjas were cut in half on the spot. It all happened in an instant. The moment Orun stopped rotating, he threw the dagger at the ninja who was aiming at another player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuhhhhhhhhhuk!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Orun was also holding a hand cannon. He landed on the floor then aimed at the two ninjas soaring in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kwa-ang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two ninjas fell helplessly as Orun fired shots at them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good job, little boy!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When not only Minsok and Orun but also Hanho threw six daggers at a time and made a combined attack, the ninjas collapsed without attacking properly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the players from the World Tree camp were fighting back well, other players were not in a good situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our defense team in the brown building at one o’clock position seems to have been annihilated. Ninjas are coming from that building!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It looks like our team on the first floor of this building has been defeated!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was saving ‘Awakening’ and ‘deity status’ in preparation for the worst situation, he could not afford to defend the Hwarang Guild.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The situation is not good. If this kind of situation continues, they won’t be able to hold out for long.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, Sungwoo and his allies had yet to confront the main forces of the Japanese troops. That’s why he was saving his skills for the upcoming fight, but he could not guarantee.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Their main unit has appeared!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They must be crazy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, Sungwoo saw a large number of Japanese troops gathering on the road not far from him. They were huge, compared with their advance party Sungwoo had annihilated. They also had several flying weapons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching them approach, the defense team of the Hwarang Guild suddenly became dejected, overwhelmed by their troops and weapons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! We killed lots of them, but they are still coming like this…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn bastards!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When their main unit arrived finally, the ninjas’ offensive began to intensify.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are coming in droves!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“More Japs are coming! Fire!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Japanese troops were laying the groundwork for the final offensive.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pop! Pop! Pop!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Several small iron barrels fell on the rooftop, rolled, and emitted white smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pushee―<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that? Is it a smoke bomb?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>” Be careful! It’s only a smokescreen!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And dozens of black shadows arose in the white smoke. After they blocked Minsok and his allies’ vision with the smoke bomb, they began to attack all at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, damn it…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With Minsok groaning in an embarrassed voice, the Japanese troops charged at them in all directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Various screams came out in the smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the end, Minsok failed to protect the shooters and wizards. And it meant his allies had been annihilated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Come on! Don’t attack them. Just come and fight me!” Hanho shouted in anger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With his six arms outstretching, he aimed everywhere in the fog. But he didn’t see anything.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Where are you! Come out!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even right now they could come out and cut him, but at that moment something fell under his feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a severed arm. The black camouflage and the dagger on his index finger showed the victim was not from Sungwoo’s allies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In no time another thing fell behind his feet. As expected, it was also a body in a black outfit. Somehow, the ninjas’ severed bodies began to pile up one by one around them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who the hell…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, a powerful gust of blue flames blew in. A powerful blow swept over the rooftop, making the smell of blood in the air stronger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho lowered his posture, protecting his head with his four arms.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the gust pushed the smokescreen away, the cruel reality of the rooftop was revealed at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my God! Jisu?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You must be Jisu, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu was standing on the railing. The bodies of ninjas were scattered everywhere on the railings and edges of the rooftop around her. That wasn’t all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crusader Team! Get ready for the battle!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the campus playground, there were about 80 knights armed with full plate armor. They were the Crusader Team led by Junghoon and his deputy Minhum.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho and his allies didn’t hear them flying in with a helicopter, but they appeared so quickly without letting anybody know.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Protect our land!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Defend it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as Junghoon shouted, he fixed a golden flag down on the floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A golden wave spread, covering the Crusaders with shields.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘The Sacred War’ is declared in the affected area. (Lasts 2 hours)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All allies gain an auto-healing effect. (2% per second)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All stats of the ‘Crusaders’ increase. (+7)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Attack!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wipe them out!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusaders rushed fiercely and pushed out the ninjas that had occupied the ground. The ninjas launched all kinds of attacks, but they couldn’t break through the Crusaders’ thick golden shields.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, what happened?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She replied, “I have cleared the hidden quest. And I learned that you participated in the Battle of Busan. This time again, I asked the King of the Great Mountain and obtained a space movement stone.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The space movement stone was an item that enabled its holder to teleport to a distant place instantly. Sungwoo and the players from the World Tree camp arrived in Busan by using the “space movement stone” that the Hunter Company obtained for him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, did you bring the Crusaders team here, Jisu?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, because you needed a reinforcement force. They are the strongest among those who can help us, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded. Ironically, he badly needed their help at this moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Free Battle’ is over!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the arrival of the reinforcement unit led by Junghoon, the free battle ended.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Please select the third ‘battle event’!<br/><br/><br/><br/>* ‘Attacker-Japanese server’ selects this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) All-out war<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Occupation war<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) Duel<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Time remaining until selection (00:04:59)<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the war in a stalemate, it was now the Japanese server’s turn again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s going to be noisy again.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The official channel’s drone camera again turned to Akira. Since he went through a hellish war for almost an hour because Sungwoo selected an all-out war, he distorted his expressions immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was so clear that he was not as complacent as before. Instead, he was full of anger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He stared at his camera and shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You can’t escape this time! Let me smash you to pieces. So, come out, Necromancer!” </div><h2 id="chapter232">Chapter 232</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>-The Japanese server has selected the 3rd option (Duel)!<br/><br/>* Both sides should select their own ‘Great Fighter’ for this duel.<br/><br/>* Failure to respond will result in a penalty for the server involved.<br/><br/>* Victory will give the server involved a buff.<br/><br/>As soon as he chose the duel option, Akira put down his name as the ‘Great Fighter.’<br/><br/>[Duel]<br/><br/>-Japanese server’s Great Fighter: Yamato’s Sword<br/><br/>-Korean server’s Great Fighter: (Undecided)<br/><br/>“Oh, this is the game in which this Japanese fighter killed the Hwarang Guild leader, right?”Jisu asked.<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>“Can I have a duel with him?”<br/><br/>She willingly volunteered to fight the Japanese master swordsman Akira. This was more suitable for Jisu than Sungwoo. In some respects, this was the perfect stage for her.<br/><br/>“Are you sure you can fight him?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo wasn’t comfortable because he already witnessed Akira’s fantastic swordsmanship. Of course, he trusted her, but at the same time, he was not sure she could win.<br/><br/>While chatting with him like that, she handed something to him. It was a necklace with black jewels. And the moment Sungwoo accepted it, two lines of messages appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/>-Shadow King’s Heir: Collect Relics (4/4)<br/><br/>-You have cleared the hidden quest of collecting the relic, ‘Successor of the Shadow King’&gt;.<br/><br/>* You are given a reward (Crown of the Shadow King)<br/><br/>Finally, Sungwoo obtained all four relics.<br/><br/>“I think this item suits you better than anybody else.”<br/><br/>“This is a really big gift for me. Thank you.”<br/><br/>She nodded and put on the Ghost Face Mask and pulled down her sword from behind her back.<br/><br/>“Now, please put my name down as the Korean server’s Great Fighter.”<br/><br/>-Remaining time until the selection of Great Fighter (00:02:58)<br/><br/>Sungwoo had no time to check for new items and the quest message.<br/><br/>He just chose her as the Great Fighter of the Korean server.<br/><br/>[Duel]<br/><br/>-Japanese server’s Great Fighter: Yamato’s Sword<br/><br/>-Korea server’s Great Fighter: kor-339<br/><br/>* Both sides’ Great Fighters should move to the ‘designated place (marked on the map)’ in10 minutes.<br/><br/>* Once a duel begins, other battles are prohibited. (In case of violation, you will be judged ‘automatic death.’)<br/><br/>Since the distance between the two warriors was not far, they were given only 10 minutes of preparation.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>With a large army lined up in the middle of a four-lane road in downtown Busan, the Japanese server’s Great Fighter and swords master Akira Okata was standing arrogantly.<br/><br/>“…Who the hell are you?” Akira shouted.<br/><br/>A woman in a red sweatshirt appeared in front of him. With a bizarre-shaped mask on her face, she was holding a sword in her right hand.<br/><br/>“You guys are driving me nuts. Let me repeat. I want to fight the Necromancer rather than a small fry like you. Isn’t he confident enough to confront me? So has he sent you a woman like you who could die instead of himself?”<br/><br/>At that moment the Korean server’s Great Fighter Jisu pulled out her sword and threw the sheath to the side. Then, she strode toward him without any hesitation.<br/><br/>She said, “No, I don’t think he has to come out to confront you. I think I can beat you at my level.”<br/><br/>“What the hell did you say?”<br/><br/>He looked at her as if she was ridiculous.<br/><br/>But she approached him and said, “You still can’t see how strong I am?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>When the distance between the two narrowed less than ten steps, there was no more ridicule on his expression. His left eyebrow wriggled.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>When she got even closer to him, he held his breath. He was now getting prepared to attack her at the decisive moment while holding his breath.<br/><br/>“I see what level you are,” she said, narrowing the distance so he was only two steps away.<br/><br/>“You still can’t size me up?”<br/><br/>When she finally stood before him, one step away from him, he stepped back, pulling his left leg first. He was now ready to draw his sword at any time.<br/><br/>Hiding her mouth, she made a cynical smile right under his chin.<br/><br/>“Don’t be scared. Let me finish it very quickly.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>-The showdown begins! (10 seconds ago)<br/><br/>Two swordsmen stood facing each other.<br/><br/>Deep tranquility spread over the perished city. There were many watching them here and there among the ruins, but none opened their mouths.<br/><br/>The official channel’s drone camera captured the stopped screen, and even the noisy chatters on the chat window became silent.<br/><br/>That meant that all the watchers were already overwhelmed by the gravitas of the two famous swordsmen from the Korean and Japanese servers.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Jisu lifted her sword first. Of course, she didn’t do it to attack him. Some unknown energy began to emanate from her body.<br/><br/>-You have activated ‘Hunting Instinct’.<br/><br/>* When the battle lasts for 120 seconds,’Hunting Start’ opens.<br/><br/>She used the ‘Hunting Instinct’, which was the ‘awakening skill’ she obtained after clearing the ‘hidden quest’ in Mt. Taebaek.<br/><br/>At that moment, her eyes were torn vertically, changing her like a wild beast with draconian teeth, a beast’s eyes, and murderous intentions.<br/><br/>-You have chosen a ‘hunting prey.’<br/><br/>She looked at her opponent, Akira. Then a certain message appeared before his eyes, too.<br/><br/>– Caution! You have fallen into ‘the prey’s blackout.’<br/><br/>* All your senses have dulled (-50%)<br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>Was it called the ultra-low frequency of the beast? Akira felt like his whole body was tingling and stiffening just like a deer facing a tiger.<br/><br/>And for a swordsman like Akira, his body’s sense was important like the instinct of a flying bird that could read which way the wind was blowing. The bird would be swept by the wind if it lost that instinct.<br/><br/>‘She is dangerous.’<br/><br/>He was alert. And that alone could help him resist such a skill attack.<br/><br/>-Your cool mental power has revived some senses.<br/><br/>* Recover all senses (+30%)<br/><br/>Then, at the moment he put forward his right foot, Akira found his opponent already standing right before his eyes.<br/><br/>He hurriedly twisted his body and instinctively swung his sword to protect his neck.<br/><br/>Clang! Clang!<br/><br/>Two sparks flew up in an instant. He quickly stepped back and lifted his sword.<br/><br/>“Footprint tracing? Hahaha!”<br/><br/>Akira also had the ‘footprint tracing’ skill, which enabled its holder to read the opponent’s movement in advance and appear on his or her expected path. And it was also a skill that he saved for the decisive moment.<br/><br/>But since his opponent already showed it, he had no reason to save it anymore.<br/><br/>“Okay, let’s have a good fight then!”<br/><br/>Akira rushed at her. He jumped off the ground and thrust his sword.<br/><br/>But she stepped back right away, hit back his sword. Then she made a big leap backward and swung her sword through the air.<br/><br/>The energy of her sword rained down over his head. He quickly bowed his head, but some of his hair was cut. He quickly got close to her, but the next moment both of them disappeared at the same time. Then, the spot where they were trying to land appeared reversely.<br/><br/>Now both were only two steps away from each other.<br/><br/>Akira hurriedly turned and swung his sword.<br/><br/>Clang! Clang! Clang!<br/><br/>In an instant, they clashed swords four times in a fierce atmosphere, but it was Akira who was more nervous now.<br/><br/>As she already showed during her fighting Huei of the Chinese server, Jisu had a very good ‘muscle strength’ for a general swordsman. At that moment, a smile was in her eyes.<br/><br/>It was a low kick. Jisu, who felt she wasn’t outpowered by him, lifted her hind leg and kicked him.<br/><br/>Akira staggered at that moment. At that moment, she cut his thigh.<br/><br/>“Well, Akira is staggering!”<br/><br/>His thigh was bleeding. And some little cheers erupted from the Korean server.<br/><br/>However, Akira was still calm. He caught his breath and quickly charged at her.<br/><br/>She lowered her posture, ready to counterattack. He swung his sword, but she responded by striking it back.<br/><br/>Hung!<br/><br/>Akira’s sword was wriggling through the blade of her sword like a phantom and penetrating her.<br/><br/>Right after that, the real blade of his sword broke through the phantom and stabbed toward her neck.<br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/>The blade of his sword was stuck in her left shoulder. The cut wasn’t deep because she twisted her body in an instant, but she was bleeding, too.<br/><br/>“Alright. How about my attack? Was it good enough?” he scornfully shouted. </div><h2 id="chapter233">Chapter 233</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>When Akira finally succeeded in cutting her shoulder, the Japanese troops shouted for joy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Responding to their thunderous cheering, he lifted his hand with a swagger. He even turned to the camera, showing his broad smile as if he seized the chance to beat her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, it’s your turn. Show me anything if you can,” he shouted at her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, you will die if I show you my next move.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He burst into a hearty laugh at her bluffing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahahaha!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He laughed loudly, then grabbed his sword again. Then, he moved his head from left to right, making a provocative move at her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come on, you Korean guys are full of bluffing! I have sized you up already. That’s how far you can show me! I can kill you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a one-line message appeared before her eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Hunting Start’ has opened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was the message she confirmed earlier, which would enable her to use the additional skill ‘Hunting Start’ when she continued to fight for 120 seconds after using ‘Hunting Instinct’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Start!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as she said that, a blue flame floating behind her back seeped into her body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, her eyes began to glow blue and blue breath soared from the gap in her mask.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Start Hunt’ has been activated for 1 minute.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All your stats have been greatly increased. (+20)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Attack power against ‘the hunting prey’ has been greatly increased. (+50%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>This skill gave her the best stats to slaughter her chosen prey, but she had to kill the prey within a minute.<br/><br/><br/><br/>’59, 58, 57…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just like a beast that concentrated on killing its prey, Jisu rushed at Akira fiercely who she decided to kill by all means.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, make my day!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, she began to wield her sword at him violently, who she was determined to kill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang! Clang! Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>She seemed to have swung the sword more violently than before, but her swinging was dominated by her instincts based on her overwhelming senses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>’52, 51….’<br/><br/><br/><br/>After clashing with her three times, he had to see his arm pushed back. Startled, he tightened his body. Only then did he realize there was some change in the way she wielded the sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang! Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuuuk! Khhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey! Big!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hit by her attacks marked by accurate timing, and power, Akira tried to find the chance to strike back, but he could not even think of it<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God… Who the hell are you? This doesn’t make any sense!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He now realized he could not hold out for long. When she kept attacking him from all directions, he began to feel a sharp pain in his joints.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And every time he felt the shock of her attack, he began to lower his knees, elbows, and waist little by little.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, Akira lost his balance, and finally, his knees bent in a humiliating blow to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Amid her endless attack, he barely managed to defend himself somehow, but he couldn’t defend properly because he kneeled. He could not grab the sword tightly, and the hilt rattled in his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the end, he let go of the hilt helplessly. His sword soared into the air and stuck in the middle of a streetlight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He knelt empty-handed, lowered his trembling hands, and slowly raised his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, how can this happen to me? I can’t believe this!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I told you already!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A beastly woman with blue eyes was looking down at him. Every time she opened her mouth, something blue came out of her mouth. The black blade of the sword in her right hand was lifted upright.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I told you if you saw my next move, you would die.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then she swiped her sword through his neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Akira’s head was cut off before soaring into the air, and his body fell to the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The city was still quiet. The main unit of the Japanese army, who was watching their fight, had no choice but to remain silent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even the players of the Korean server forgot to cheer for joy, overwhelmed by Jisu’s incredible fighting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Korean server ‘kor-339’ has won!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Victory buff’ is given to the Korean server!<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Attack power Increases for 2 hours (+30%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! We have won!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s awesome! Jackpot!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only after a message about their victory popped up before their eyes did the Korean server shout for joy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the majority of the troops were left behind on campus, there were only 30 who came here, but their shouting was louder than before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Jisu didn’t yet let her guard down, grabbing the sword tightly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She glared at Akira’s body, feeling some ominous energy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘No, it’s not over yet.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Her hunch was right. Some unexpected weird phenomena began to take place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Akira’s head, which was cut off, began to move alone and floated in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What came next was disgusting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tsutsutsutsu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blood veins protruded in bundles at the cut section of his neck. They clumped into one place and began to shape a huge body, like clay.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In no time a body in the shape of a big giant was completed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It had a red body about 4 meters long, black wings protruding from the back, looking like a goblin called a “tengu” in Japanese mythology.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You have made me turn to the last resort…I won’t forgive you,” said the eerie being in a clumsy voice. It seemed like a mutation caused by some item. Did he become a monster instead of prolonging his life?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is it a human being?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While the Korean server was whispering in shock, Sungwoo, who had been watching the whole thing, stepped forward.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, let me take care of him from now on. As you know, it’s my specialty to kill a big guy like him.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was not a one-to-one confrontation. Sungwoo thought of using the undead to get rid of him. He felt they could do it for the remaining 14 minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Japanese troops were in chaos, at a loss about what to do because their leader was killed to their astonishment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Electric current was flowing from his hands. It seemed that this monster would not simply launch only physical attacks. So Sungwoo summoned Bone Drake and Ogre Skeleton behind him right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come on! Let me tear them off!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Jisu shouted, “Sungwoo, watch out for that in the air!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu was feeling some other danger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo trusted her warning and made Bone Drake protect their heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Peeeeeeee!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo raised his head, he saw an object that appeared to be a bomb flying toward him while making a whistling noise. It wasn’t one or two. Dozens of them were falling all over downtown Busan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ooops! They are flying toward us, too!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The target of that unknown object was specific.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Regardless of the Korean server or the Japanese server, all of them were in the striking range of the unknown object. It was an indiscriminate bombing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shells exploded everywhere before they could escape, and at that point, black smoke began to spread all over the city along the alleys.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The black smoke swallowed up everything. Painful screams began to come everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In particular, the main unit of the Japanese army was hit by a huge number of shells.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, those Japanese players who breathed in the black smoke began to fall helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This is the Breath of Abyss.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo found out the identity of the shells at once and naturally guessed who masterminded this surprise attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The Evolution Society. Why the heck did they join hands with the Japanese server?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Mana has been greatly increased by ‘Abyss of al Breath’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Abyss of Breath’ is accumulating in the body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Breath of Abyss brought a tremendous buff to the Necromancer. The Evolution Society would probably know this. Then, why did they launch an attack with this Breath of Abyss?<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Grim Reaper’ retention time has been increased.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Anubis’ retention time has been increased.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Alright, let me get rid of you guys, no matter what!’ </div><h2 id="chapter234">Chapter 234</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>When the black smoke that filled downtown Busan, the Breath of Abyss, approached Sungwoo, he could feel how strong it was. Its powerful vitality dominated his body, making the cooldown of all his skills back to the default.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It’s so strong and so different from in the past.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that the Evolution Society developed a much more toxic Breath of Abyss through continuous research.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head and looked at Jisu. Her item, ‘Ghost Facial Mask’, seemed to have some anti-toxic gas function, but its effects were limited. Other players were exposed to the gas without any preparation for such an attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, take people and get out of this place right now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How about you, Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m fine, so I’ll catch up with you after checking out the surroundings!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Human monsters wearing gas masks began to appear from all sides.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With gas cylinders on their back, they sprayed the Breath of Abyss through some sort of pipes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not content with using the shells, they were turning the entire area dark by spraying toxic gas.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Are they trying to fill the whole city with the Breath of Abyss? Why? Ain’t I their target?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘Breath of Abyss’ is accumulating in your body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The cooldown of ‘all skills’ has been reduced.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But they didn’t know the Breath of Abyss gave the Necromancer a huge buff.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuuuuh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Help me!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If the Evolution Society kept up with the gas attack like this, it would most likely annihilate even the Japanese troops they joined hands with. They numbered 5000. Such a large force, who had not suffered any damages until now, was dying rapidly, fully exposed to the Breath of Abyss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Then, the Evolution Society even planned this?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo started to have reasonable doubts about what those crazy guys of the Evolution Society had been doing. Did they bring in the Japanese troops because they needed such a huge number for “test targets”?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Kugugugugugu!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A roar broke out above their heads. Shortly afterward, a transport plane appeared in the dark sky. The transport plane was crashing toward downtown Busan with smoke on its tail wings. In no time, it fell between the two buildings and crashed ruthlessly on the road where Japanese troops were crowded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kwaguaguaguagua!<br/><br/><br/><br/>That big chunk of metal crushed the Japanese soldiers like a tsunami made of steel. Then, pushing the asphalt road like dough, it slid towards the place where Tengu, the reincarnation of the killed Akira, and Sungwoo were standing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Khhhhhhhh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tengu, who was struggling in pain while breathing in the Breath of Abyss, turned after finding the transport plane falling toward him. He stretched out both hands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thick black wings spread, sputtering sparks all over his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, like the item called “Blessing of Thunder God,” used by Ogre Skeleton, tremendous electric shocks erupted from both hands and began to block the transport aircraft running toward him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheeejik- Cheeejik-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The transport plane began to slow down at the electric shock, and soon stopped half-buried in an asphalt road.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chijik! Cheeeejik!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Electricity could be seen flowing over the surface of the scrap metal. Melted gray paint spilled onto the road and sparks splattered from the control board in the cockpit. The two pilots were already dead, turning into charcoal in fireballs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>But there was still something inside the plane.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was trying to get out of the wreckage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, something came out after opening the “lamp door,” which was tattered on impact.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gu- Gu-<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a monster with an unclear shape. As smooth as a lugworm, it had a sticky body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When it spotted Tengu nearby, it lifted its huge body into the air then revealed hundreds of teeth hidden in its body while opening its four-part head. The inside of its hollow throat looked like a deep sewer pipe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking at that monster, Tengu raised his fist as if he was annoyed. Something unrealistic took place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The head of the lugworm charged at him like a bullet and swallowed his head at once. Tengu couldn’t react because it happened in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh! Ahhhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tengu desperately struggled with all his might. He tried to push it away by all means, but he was gradually being sucked into its mouth. Its hundreds of teeth moved gradually and began to crush Tengu’s head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wooduk! Wooduk! Wuuuuuuuuuu!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tengu could resist only briefly. The lugworm quickly swallowed his neck, chest, and stomach then his whole body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His body disappeared into the monster’s mouth, and his arms and legs were still left. Then, the moment Tengu’s soles disappeared, only black feathers were fluttering on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While watching that terrific scene, Sungwoo unwittingly stepped back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That monster showed something grotesque that could be found in a powerful monster, but something that only humans could feel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What the hell is that?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t figure out what that monster was.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kouuu- Kouuu-<br/><br/><br/><br/>After eating Tengu, the monster made a short cry as if it was in a good mood. Then, it opened its four-pronged mouth towards the sky. It seemed as if it was trying to make photosynthesis.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whoo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Breath of Abyss in the air began to suck into his body, but it wasn’t just the Breath of Abyss being sucked into it. The Breath of Abyss got mixed with the souls that came out of the bodies of the Japanese soldiers on the road that the transport plane traversed then got sucked into the body of the monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Swallowing their souls?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo noticed he and the monster had some similarities. For example, the monster gained strength from the Breath of Abyss, and when Sungwoo turned into the condition of ‘Anubis,’ Sungwoo could make use of the souls of the dead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, something popped through the skin on its back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was black wings, which were similar to the black-feathered wings of Tengu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It can absorb the power of its prey.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, someone walked out to the monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Long time, no see!” he said to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was a man in a black suit, wearing a full-face gas mask. His face glimmered inside the translucent reinforced plastic armor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, of course, you must have met another me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo said, “You must be the leader of the Evolution Society.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo once had met him. He was the head of the Evolution Society, “DOCTOR,” who he encountered in the underground facility of Beomgye Station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, what number are you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This guy could create clones, and such clones were also listed in the Korean server rankings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At one time, five clones, each with a different number, were all ranked within the top 20 of the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“My number doesn’t matter,” he said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly, the Breath of the Abyss downtown faded away and sunlight came back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the guy’s gas mask reflected light, Sungwoo could not see his expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The masked man said, “After all, it’s all one. Both you and the bodies scattered here must be one. It should be like that in the future. That’s the ending of this game.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The drone of the official channel was still operating in the sky. The players all over the world were witnessing all the strange phenomena happening on the Korean server at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They couldn’t understand what was going on now. They were curious about what the Korean server was doing, and why this kind of thing happened one after another.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was originally a war between the Korean server and the Japanese server, but at some point, two Korean players stood facing each other.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, you guys brought in the Japanese server for this purpose from the beginning,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He nodded at that and replied, “You are sharp-minded. I think you remember another me telling you that I was working on death, so I needed a war to secure the material of a large number of deaths. I needed an object that could rather easily die.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>DOCTOR reached out and pointed at the monster behind his back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, this is the result.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monster was evolving rapidly as if he met some “conditions” after breathing in the Breath of Abyss and souls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly, ugly forelimbs protruded out of its body, which looked like giant hooks. Moreover, the tail became the form of a mace, protruding from the end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I would like to introduce myself to you formally. My name is Chimera.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chimera, a monster from Greek mythology, was known as a mixture of all kinds of beasts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The unidentified monster created by the Evolution Society was also a random mix of parts that would not fit at all when put together. Each of those parts looked like a deadly weapon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It is the ultimate creature we have created by studying death.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a message rang.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Exclusive Quest]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Title: Existence of Wrong Death<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Type: Hunt<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Goal: Eliminate the player-manufactured creature ‘Chimera’<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Reward: Exclusive skill<br/><br/><br/><br/>*Those who deceive death are performing strange rituals with wrong beliefs, which produced a result. If you don’t get rid of him quickly, he will not only deceive death, but also make it meaningless, and that means that there are no more beings left in this world who can face death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* If the target is left neglected for a long time, he will turn into a being that you will never be able to confront.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Your choice affects your ‘destiny’. </div><h2 id="chapter235">Chapter 235</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>An ‘exclusive quest’ was issued. After checking the message, Sungwoo raised his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Death is not something you can control by studying it,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>DOCTOR smiled bloody and stepped aside.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chimera, a giant monster that had already been transformed, came one step forward.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Its size had already grown to about 30m. As the quest message said, it seemed that Chimera was getting stronger and stronger after each kill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is this what you mean by being one body? All humans are being eaten by that monster?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What a fantastic future! Yes, we’re all heading towards the ultimate one.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>DOCTOR’s voice was very polite.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He continued, “I’m sorry for coming late, but can I take the climax?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taking the climax?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having heard that, Sungwoo alternately looked at “DOCTOR” and Chimera<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he giggled at them. He pulled an object from his pocket.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching him, DOCTOR scorned him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is that? Is it something valuable that you can take out to confront Chimera?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a nondescript black crown with no ornaments.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t be mistaken.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Shadow King’s Crown<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Class: Myth-Classification: Hat<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Private (Qualification required)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: You can use ‘Shadow King’s Power’ only when you collect all the Shadow King’s relics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Holds Shadow King’s Relics (4/4)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You haven’t seen the climax yet,” said Sungwoo, then he slowly put on the crown.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your qualifications have been verified.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Shadow King’s Power’ has been granted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ooooooooooh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s shadow began to expand to an enormous size.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even without the influence of light, it grew endlessly, ignoring all the natural laws. And it soon reached the building behind him. As if it was blocking the light of a projector, the shape of a giant filled one side of the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo did not move. The shadow moved alone. It spread and raised both hands slowly and widely as if it were a benevolent king, looking down on everything and controlling everything.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in the affected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Death Response’ begins in the affected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Black smoke soared around Sungwoo. Among that came out dozens of undead. Then, a black swamp unfolded, where a horde of zombies crawled out. After that, corpses on the battlefield were entangled, before two “Flesh Golems” raised themselves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>All of them stood tall around Sungwoo. They were the total force that Sungwoo could summon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haven’t I seen all of them in the past?” said DOCTOR in a relaxed voice. He thought they could not beat Chimera, but this time something new to DOCTOR unfolded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Shadow Corps’ will rise in that area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The shadows of the undead troops began to wriggle. They were moving even when the owner of the shadow didn’t move at all. And their hands, which were two-dimensional planes, popped out into the air from the bottom.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tsutsutsutsu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>The shadows began to climb into the real world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tsutsutsutsutsu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>Other shadows climbed up from the ground and stood among the undead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the shadow slowly turned its black face and looked at DOCTOR and Chimera.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the moment when the Necromancer’s forces doubled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is the climax!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As always, the climax happened when he wanted it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo received a black necklace from Jisu a little while ago.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Shadow King’s Necklace<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Necklace<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Increases stamina (+6). You can obtain ‘visual information’ and ‘auditory information’ by controlling one shadow in your view (Cooldown: 5 minutes)<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was the Shadow King’s last legacy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ve got all of them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>By collecting all four relics, Sungwoo completed the hidden quest titled “Heir to the Shadow King”. And finally, he took possession of the “Crown of the Shadow King.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have acquired a new skill as the ‘Heir to the Shadow King’. (Power of the Shadow King)<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Shadow King’s Power<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: Shadow King’s Heir + Shadow King’s Crown<br/><br/><br/><br/>The cooldown of all skills related to ‘Shadow King’s Relics’ has been drastically reduced. (-50%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>+ Shadow King’s Army: You can realize all the shadows under your control as ‘shadow soldiers’ for one hour.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shadow soldiers have 50% attack power and 150% defense power, but they do not disappear until their original owner dies. (Cooldown: 12 hours)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is a jackpot!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, Sungwoo had completed a set item that could create optimal synergy with the existence of the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the very next moment, the subject of his experiment appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was none other than the Evolution Society, a cockroach-like and deep-rooted arch-enemy of Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But right now, DOCTOR, who witnessed the Shadow Corps, couldn’t hide his anxiety even though he was wearing a gas mask.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo shouted, “You don’t think only you have been developing something new, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chimera was a powerful creature. So much so that it ate Tengu who had enough power to stop a huge transport plane. With such terrific power, DOCTOR might have thought Chimera could get rid of the Necromancer who defeated them every time, but who could have expected that the Necromancer also became stronger, and doubly at that in an instant?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s amazing to see you whenever I see you,” DOCTOR honestly expressed his feelings, but he didn’t give up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>DOCTOR trusted the creature he made. Wasn’t it the fruit of the long and hard efforts of the Evolutionary Society?<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a vicious monster that would never bow down even when it faced the incredibly strong Necromancer. Chimera was certainly such a creature.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I admit this is your climax.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You are trying to distract me with words.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo did not want to continue to converse with him. Even while he was talking bullshit, his time to maintain the Shadow Corps was decreasing. For now, Sungwoo’s only enemy was time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know how long you spent making that shit, but I can smash it in an instant,” Sungwoo quipped.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo then lifted the black sickle. At the same time, a huge shadow cast on the building reached out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alright. You just keep sitting there and counting the numbers.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was Sungwoo’s attack signal. The death corps was ordered to charge at DOCTOR and his forces.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Goo Goo Goo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, a tremendous vibration rang out in downtown Busan. A group of undead and shadow soldiers filling the four-lane roads began to move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they began to move, tangled with each other, they seemed to be moving as if they were a huge group. As such, they were charging at their target in an organized manner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You guys are so impatient!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>DOCTOR fled, whistling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then Chimera, who had been stopped, reacted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Without hesitation, Chimera began to stamp his feet. The moment they collided, Chimera violently swung his front legs that looked like hooks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kwaguaguaguagua!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those at the forefront of Sungwoo’s forces were caught in the hooks. They had tremendous destructive power, enough to smash a large skeleton to pieces, but that was all. Chimera’s hooks smashed only some of the hundreds of processions, but an unstoppable storm swallowed Chimera.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Corps of Death charged at Chimera like raging waves. Like a huge ship being swept away by waves, his huge body skidded on the road helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The mixed forces of skeletons, zombies, ghouls, shadow soldiers, and all kinds of undead jumped at Chimera like crazy dogs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Some of them penetrated through his feet. Some climbed over his head. And others turned around and hung on his side and back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They punched, struck, and kicked their target with all their might. Although their attacks were not powerful, they continued to inflict damage on Chimera.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Despite their intensive attack, Chimera tried moving desperately. He began to shake off those stuck on his body with the tremendous elasticity peculiar to the annular animal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He then rotated his long body and swung his tail like a mace, which struck down dozens of undead, but the undead had no intention of retreating. They resurrected and went straight back to the battlefield. They looked like a herd of pit bulls charging at their target. They were tenacious and persistent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They never died. They didn’t stop because they didn’t die. Chimera couldn’t stop them because they didn’t stop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, Chimera found himself being pushed out until he bumped into an eight-story building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although he suffered such an intensive attack, driven into the dead end, it was the building that began to collapse first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since hundreds of monsters kept attacking him as one unit, there was no way for Chimera to stick it out to the end. </div><h2 id="chapter236">Chapter 236</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>As the collapsing outer walls and concrete lumps poured down like rain, the drone of the official channel that had been filming all these scenes avoided the debris and raised its altitude.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wooooooong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>All these fierce fighting scenes were being captured by the camera, and the whole world was witnessing the Necromancer’s incredible performance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This must be crazy!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this neighborhood? So scary…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The surviving soldiers of the Japanese server were stunned to watch the dreadful scenes from a distance. They set foot on a foreign land under the name of the “main force,” but they found themselves messed up even without fighting the Necromancer and his allies. Fortunately, they could save their lives because they brought some emergency gas masks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh! They are charging at us!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Run away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, they were in a precarious situation just like a lamp before the wind. Chimera and the Necromancer’s army popped out through the building into the alley where the Japanese remnants were hiding at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was a situation where, as the saying goes, an innocent bystander often gets beaten up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Japanese soldiers were smashed after they were embroiled in the fierce fight between the two sides. Their final moments were so tragic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chimera and the undead army didn’t care about them. They broke through a few more buildings before coming out to the broad street. Their bloody fighting continued there. It was like hundreds of hounds biting one brown bear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The vehicles left neglected on the road were pushed back and forth as if they were swept away by a flood. The asphalt roads were broken down like dirt playgrounds, and the street trees were bent like reeds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chimera’s body was already tattered by now. In particular, its black wings that grew after it ate Tengu were completely crushed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Well, it’s time I wrapped up this fight.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt the time finally came for him to kill Chimera and sent a hand signal behind his back. Then, a huge object began to move on the roof of a building. A long muzzle turned its direction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, two blue flashes flew in and hit the camera hard with Sungwoo’s subordinate spirits. It was the Iron Mace of Lighting. Those soldiers covering Chimera were smashed in an instant, and Chimera’s left hook was cut off by the iron mace’s terrible power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuheeeeeeh! Kuheeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Evil Spirit Bomb’ has been embedded in your weapon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t the end. Sungwoo fired the 20 ‘Evil Spirit Bombs’ that he had loaded in advance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gu-gu-gu-gu-gung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A black marble exploded above Chimera’s head. Its impact was so powerful that the asphalt floor he was stepping on gave way suddenly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Chimera was different from the monsters Sungwoo had dealt with.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeh! Kueeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>How could that monster scream like that even when he was attacked so brutally?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Did it mean that Chimera could still strike back?<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I need a more powerful attack.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo used up all the remaining souls to fight it out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘Twilight Raid’ has begun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time he turned to the Twilight Raid. Sungwoo’s body mingled with the evil spirits, then charged at Chimera.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Goooo!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Chimera became groggy with repeated shocks from the attack, Sungwoo bound its body with the ‘Ghost’s Hand.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Now is the time!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly afterward, the sky was covered with black shadows. It was the shadow of the “Bone Wyvern Alpha Male.” He grabbed Chimera’s body and suddenly started soaring into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alright. Let me test how hard you are.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Falling from the sky. That was Sungwoo’s last strategy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bone Wyvern Alpha Male flapped its huge wings and soared hundreds of meters in the air at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, when the retention time of the Ghost’s Hand expired, Chimera began to move again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It struggled in the claws of Bone Wyvern Alpha Male, then attempted to escape by extreme means.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chimera swung its right hook and tore apart the wings of Bone Wyvern Alpha Male at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now freed from Bone Wyvern Alpha Male, it began free fall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Not done yet!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>In preparation for this kind of situation, Sungwoo dispatched another Bone Wyvern in advance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another Bone Wyvern flying nearby immediately rushed, grabbed Chimera’s head in the middle, then began to soar in the air vertically.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time again the Bone Wyvern was crushed by Chimera while soaring, but another Wyvern snatched Chimera again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When a series of Bone Wyverns took turns raising their altitude with Chimera in their claws, they succeeded in flying up thousands of meters in the air. Chimera looked like a tiny dot in Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was high enough in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Drop it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bone Wyvern let go of Chimera by loosening its claws. Chimera’s body began to fall helplessly, spinning round and round.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chimera spread its black wings to keep its balance desperately, but it couldn’t because his body was cut during the melee.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kieeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Free-falling from the sky had a much stronger impact than expected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment an aircraft or spacecraft made of the best alloys hit the ground, it shattered to pieces in an instant. It’s not because it is less sturdy but because the impact of the free fall is much more destructive than expected. The same goes for well-made biological weapons. Chimera’s body fell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud-<br/><br/><br/><br/>A slight vibration from its impact spread over the roads in the city. Its body was shattered to pieces, so much so that its shape could not be recognized.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 1,000,000 gold by hunting ‘Experiment No.-455’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have acquired the title of ‘Experiment Disposal Manager’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All stats increase (+1)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though Sungwoo killed the worst monster of all time, he got only a million gold as a reward. Aside from its pettiness, this game was not worth a candle for Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nonetheless, he earned one title, but it was not satisfactory because it was not a monster made by the system.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But there was one important thing left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have successfully cleared the exclusive quest ‘The Wrong Death’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*You are given a reward. (Exclusive skill)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo confirmed the newly acquired skill after successfully clearing the exclusive quest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Appointed Death Wizard<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Basic<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Consumption: 50 Mana<br/><br/><br/><br/>*When you resurrect a skeleton, you can give it ‘magical talent’ to make it a ‘skeleton mage’. (Maximum 5). Skeleton Mage can use attack magic and curse-type magic, and it will use more powerful magic when the skill grade improves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Skeleton Mage can become a ‘Death Priest’ if it meets ‘specific conditions’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Skeleton Mage can become ‘Lich’ if it satisfies ‘specific conditions’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, I have obtained the right reward finally,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The enemy’s challenge also left behind several gifts this time, too.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the other hand, DOCTOR realized that he couldn’t win even with Chimera, so he chose to run away early on. But he didn’t run away that far because Jisu, who had evacuated other players, sensed his movement and started tracking him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A little later, DOCTOR was dragged back in a miserable condition before Sungwoo with his limbs cut off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He had a helicopter waiting nearby to run away just in case. I caught him just before its takeoff.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>DOCTOR looked up at Sungwoo, with his face covered with blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s useless if you kill me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What he meant was that since he was only one of the clones, the Evolution Society would continue to survive even if Sungwoo killed him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But it doesn’t make any sense for me not to kill you, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo knew it was just pointless to talk with him anymore, so he killed that guy without any hesitation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the nickname “DOCTOR-001” disappeared from the player rankings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Except for the core creature, ranked 7th in the Korean server rankings, he was listed as the highest rank.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo felt somewhat uneasy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This fight will never end here.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>As long as the core creature that generated the clone “DOCTOR-000” survived, the Evolution Society would attack Sungwoo again by using another grotesque means.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, there may still be some human monsters made by the Evolution Society around here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I have to catch them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah. We need some clue to pursue them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo still did not know where the Evolution Society was located. Unless he rooted them out completely, this kind of annoying thing would keep happening.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘By the way, the Korean-Japanese servers’ war has not yet finished…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had some other work to finish before chasing the remnants of the Evolution Society. The whole world was watching the fierce fight between the Korean and Japanese servers, but it was clear that the victory of the Korean server was around the corner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Alright. Let me finish this war first.’ </div><h2 id="chapter237">Chapter 237</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sungwoo led the undead army to Busan Port. The Japanese troops left behind at the port were preparing to retreat, but more than half of the battleships were already sailing offshore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can’t just let you guys leave like that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately dispatched a group of Bone Wyverns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since fixed turrets were installed on the back of Bone Wyverns, they launched indiscriminate air bombardment at their battleships.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eventually, Sungwoo succeeded in wiping out all the remnants of the Japanese server’s invading forces.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their battleships were sunk deep in the sea, and that was the end of the Korean and Japanese war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The Korean server has won the final victory in the ‘1st Korean-Japanese War!<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Reward is given in proportion to the contribution of the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Rewards for the 1st Korean-Japanese war are given.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Contribution: 1st place<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Reward: 30,000,000 gold<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Additional reward: ‘War Hero’ title.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have acquired the title of ‘War Hero’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All stats increase (+2)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, Necromancer? Is our fight over now?” asked the new leader of the Hwarang Guild. Sungwoo shook his head and said, “I don’t know what else they did somewhere on this land. Mobilize your troops to search for suspicious stuff, especially look for the traces of the Evolution Society.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could not let the Evolution Society guys escape this time. So, he asked not only the Hwarang Guild but also the Hunter Company and the “Wide Area Surveillance Team” of the Liberation Guild to chase those affiliated with the Evolutionary Society. Junghoon also accepted Sungwoo’s request.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They will go into hiding for some time. So, we have to track them down when they have revealed themselves next.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Liberation Guild knew very well that neglecting them was like raising terrorists.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are our public enemy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, Sungwoo’s allies began the largest search operation of all time. They originally intended to find the hidden main stronghold of the Evolution Society by tracking the movement path of the Evolutionary Society everywhere, starting in Busan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But strangely enough, their traces were found in a place that they had never expected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was none other than the 2nd Korean-Japanese War quest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Server Quest]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Title: The 2nd Korean-Japanese War: Bloody Return Match<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Type: War<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Purpose: Winning the war<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Compensation: to be announced later<br/><br/><br/><br/>The first Korean-Japanese War broke out due to the Japanese server’s attack. And it was the Korean server, the defender, that raised the flag of victory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And this time the Korean server is given a chance to counterattack. It is up to the Korean server whether to resolve the deep-rooted animosity between the two servers through a bloody war or forget it calmly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* If the leader of the Korean server (kor-157) chooses to give up the counterattack, the quest will end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Information on the 1st Korean-Japanese War]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Special rules will be given for their exciting fight. Here are the details:<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) The counter attacker (Korean server) is given a ‘big counterattack bonus’. The leader of the counterattack side can use the ‘location check’ of the hostile forces and the ‘quick move’ to their location.<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Depending on each individual’s will, they can support the opposite server and they are allowed to transfer to the opposite server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>3) All the processes of the quest will be broadcast live through the official channel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The system didn’t ask the Korean server for a vague counterattack. Instead, the system gave them a lot of merits to urge them to take revenge against the Japanese server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Location check?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>So-called “location check” and “quick movement” were special benefits intended for a surprise attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The location of the ‘hostile forces’ is displayed on the map.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You can open ‘Hyper Gate (fast movement)’ by selecting one of the marked locations. (Remaining number of times: 1)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, a map appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes. It was a map of the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago. On the map, only two spots were marked with red dots. The first one was Japan’s “Tsushima” island.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If it were Tsushima island, it would be the place where the Japanese army is located. But didn’t they say Kyushu was their main base?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t know their specific situation, but it seemed clear that the outpost of the “Kyushu Unified Army” that attacked the Korean server was based in Tsushima.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘So, I can move there, according to the reward?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t a bad idea for Sungwoo to raid it right now and wipe it out. Since their main unit was destroyed by the Korean server, they were probably defenseless. So, this was the perfect time to mount a large-scale counterattack against them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the problem was the second red dot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Daejeon?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The red dot was stamped on the Korean peninsula at Daejeon. At first, Sungwoo could not understand why the “hostile forces” of the Korean server were in Daejeon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, he soon came to know the reason when he thought about who could be the hostile players of the Korean server inside Korea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They must be the Evolution Society.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were ruled as “hostile forces” by the system and marked on the map. Daejon was their main base. After all, they left a trace they could never hide after making such bold terrorist attacks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, what should we do now? Should we invade Japan like when we attacked Taiwan?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo shook his head. He felt he could get rid of the Japanese server at any time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, if he could not smash the Evolution Society this time, he would never know where these cockroach-like guys would lay eggs, grow, and crawl out. So, he needed to track them down by all means.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me crack down on these bastards in Daejon first.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, it was time for him to annihilate these wicked players once and for all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The main base of the Evolution Society has been kept under wraps until now. Even though Sungwoo and the “Wide Area Surveillance Team” of the Liberation Guild searched for them everywhere, they could not gather any information.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But, for some reason, the system put red dots on the map, so their location was revealed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The important thing is that the Evolution Society guys don’t know I know their location..’<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, Sungwoo could mount a perfect surprise attack. However, he needed to be very careful because they had very good intelligence. If they noticed something strange, there was a strong possibility that it would quickly escape like a loach.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Sungwoo mobilized all his forces to pretend they were searching for the Evolution Society.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a deception tactic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If I want to launch a surprise attack, I can use the “quick movement” bonus, but I have to save it just in case in the future.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was supposed to attack Tsushima Island for the 2nd Korean-Japanese War right after getting rid of the Evolution Society guys, so he decided to save the one-time-only ‘quick movement’ for that purpose because there was no good way for him to cross the sea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, Daejeon was located close enough to Suwon, so he could attack it anytime he wanted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, let’s all go home, everybody. We need to figure out how many are here, so, get aboard the helicopter!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I want to tell them how well we fought here. I can’t wait!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players of the World Tree camp were preparing to return to their main base in Suwon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they came to Busan, they used an item called “Space Movement Stone”, but unfortunately, there were none left. So, they borrowed four helicopters from the Hwarang Guild.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players of the World Tree camp were eagerly preparing to return home in excitement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo called her secretly. She knew why he called her, so she followed him cautiously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘There may be somebody keeping an eye on us.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The enemies could collect information with a skill specialized in espionage instead of simply monitoring them. Therefore, the two conversed secretly behind the helicopters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We will sneak into the main base of the Evolution Society after moving along the road leading to Suwon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though he didn’t explain much, she nodded as if she knew what he was talking about.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, it reminds me of Bumgye Station where I fought them. I hope I won’t see them again.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, that’s why we have to get rid of them tonight.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had no detailed operational plan. He just thought he and Jisu could move down to Daejon to get rid of them. That was enough.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the afternoon when darkness began to fall, Sungwoo began returning to Suwon with the players of the World Tree camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With Bone Wyvern escorting them, four helicopters took off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, when they were moving from Boeun-gun area to Cheongju area, Sungwoo and Jisu slipped away from them using Zombie Birds and turned to Daejeon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their secret operation to infiltrate into the Evolutionary Society began. </div><h2 id="chapter238">Chapter 238</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The day was breaking. The red dot on the map, namely the headquarters of the Evolution Society, was pointing to a mountain in Daejeon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu were making their way through the woods. Since it was impossible for them to walk into the main gate, they had no choice but to pass through the woods.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This way, Sungwoo.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even if they had a map, it would be very difficult for them to get the right directions in the mountain without any equipment, but Jisu, who spent a few days in Mt. Taebaek, was very helpful to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I think even an existing trail might have been blocked in this deep mountain because it had never been maintained at all,” she said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I see why they concealed their main base here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were already approaching the red dot marked on the map, so the two moved a little more secretly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But when they arrived at the expected point, Sungwoo felt something was wrong.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was nothing there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“···”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was just an endless forest. Sungwoo once again checked the map, but this place was right. “This the place…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Be quiet! Get down!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Jisu pulled him into the bush.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Her eyes were rolling fast. However, Sungwoo saw nothing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you see anything?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, I can’t see it either. But I can feel something…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She did not see it with her eyes but with a different sense. She began to move forward carefully, and Sungwoo followed her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have entered the ‘curtain of virtual image’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* A substance that was not visible from the outside has been revealed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment they took a step, what they saw changed in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is …”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The dense trees disappeared, and a building and iron fence appeared in its place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu opened her mouth, looking back and front.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There was something like a cover-up device here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Using a certain item, somebody was hiding the entire huge facility from outsiders’ view.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Without a map, no one would ever think of going into this remote mountain, so it was safe to say they were not caught coming here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s huge…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think a military base used to be here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The headquarters of the Evolution Society was a facility built by remodeling a military base. Accordingly, it was a fairly large area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Given that a large number of trucks were moving inside the barbed wires, it seemed that there were many soldiers based here. There was very tight security, with watchtowers installed all over the place, and their security guards were a mix of human monsters and players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s check out a little more by walking along the fence.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was not hasty. He needed to check out their power as much as possible for a fatal attack. Then, they discovered some human monsters were wearing metal collars on their necks while working inside the iron fence. Other human monsters were monitoring them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Was there an internal struggle?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first glance, Sungwoo could realize that not all human monsters here were of the same rank. It meant that there were rulers and ruled among them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A cruel research facility peculiar to the Evolution Society appeared far inside the fence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s what we saw last time in Pyeongtaek.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were a lot of familiar research subjects piled up at the place she pointed. They were combat weapons with human heads, bodies made of cloth, and animal limbs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first glance, they numbered several hundred. It wasn’t clear whether they were functioning or being scrapped, but their experiments required a huge number of sacrifices.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘There are so many parts and human bodies piled up there…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu said, raising her finger, “Look at that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>All kinds of bodies were piled up in one pit. It was the source of the bad smell that had been filling the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Water tanks that had been disposed of were strewn everywhere. Inside them were floating the heads of humans and human monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are crazy…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although this was a tough world where one’s life was regarded as valuable, Sungwoo felt he had to stop their experiments. If they were left neglected, they would try to experiment with the entire Korean peninsula.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s get started.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now was the time for Sungwoo to root out the Evolution Society.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think it would be better to detonate bombs inside than to hit them from the outside. What do you think, Jisu?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s firepower was overwhelming, but it had the fatal weakness of only one hour of retention. If he began to attack from the outside to get into their core facility, they were more likely to hold out inside the facility. In that case, they would try to counterattack after holding out for an hour behind the solid walls while blocking the undead army.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘That’s why I can kill these guys more certainly when I attack them from the deepest part of their facility.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu also agreed with him, and they soon found a place that seemed to be a key facility.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, that’s their core facility.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a cylindrical building with no windows, but it looked like a nuclear reactor containment building from a distance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How can we get in there?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As she said, it didn’t seem easy to get inside the building. Except for the vents, there were no holes for them to squeeze in, and there were a large number of security guards around it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Moreover, several snipers were dispatched on the rooftop, on the lookout for the surrounding areas.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, if Sungwoo and Jisu approached it carelessly, they would give the security guards enough time to respond, which would mean they would have to fight their way into the building with difficulty.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ve got an idea,” Sungwoo said. “Only I can use it, so let me get in first and make an opening.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately started the operation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have summoned ‘Specter’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two ghosts appeared behind Sungwoo. They passed freely through obstacles and slowly approached the core facility. They were able to hide in objects such as trees and rocks, so they avoided the eyes of the security guards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it, why do I suddenly have caught a chill.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Me, too…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If Sungwoo summoned Specters, his target fell to the curse of ‘fear’ and ‘movement speed reduction.’ Even though they didn’t see the Specters yet, they had goosebumps just by being around Specters. It was a typical phenomenon they experienced when they got a cold and creepy feeling with the ghosts around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Go into the building.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two Specters succeeded in accessing the core facility, then squeezed themselves into the solid concrete exterior walls. It was a completely enclosed building without a single window, but Specters were ghosts. So, they overcame such physical limits and succeeded in infiltrating into the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo shared the Specters’ senses, so he could overhear those inside the core facility talking with each other.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I heard ‘No. 1’ failed again this time?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, did you trigger the highest alert? But if that guy was No. 1, he must have taken Chimera with him, right? But that monster was killed? Are you sure?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While he was overhearing their conversation like that, a pretty neat facility came into his eyes. Soon, the owners of the voices came back through the hallway. They were players in white gowns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I’m not sure, but that’s what I heard. None of the commandos No. 1 took with him this time came out alive.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crazy, who the hell is this Necromancer? As you know, we ground so many human monsters to make Chimera. Yeah, that’s why the heads of human monsters are hostile to us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, that white rider, Werewolf, was put into jail for opposing Dr. Yu. It looks like Dr. Yu is trying to get rid of the beasts.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I like that. I was sick and tired of mingling with the smelly things.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo searched inside the facility to find a shadowy place, but it was so bright and well-organized inside it was not easy for him to find it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After passing through several walls, the Specters arrived in a room full of corpses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What the heck is this again?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed to be a kind of warehouse where their research materials were stored, but like a butcher shop, the bodies of orcs and ogres were hanging from the ceiling. Their drooping bodies formed shadows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I’ve found them.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stopped sharing the Specters’ vision and looked at Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think I can do it. Just wait a bit.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo once again shared the Specters’ vision then teleported to the shadow inside the building using the function of the ‘Shadow King’s Bracelet’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, his body arose in the shadows. It was a facility boasting of the highest security, but Sungwoo could easily infiltrate using the ‘Specters’ and ‘shadow movement’ skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘These guys are using these bodies to extract the Breath of Abyss. Man, what a huge amount!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was stunned to find the numerous corpses piled up in the vast warehouse.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What he saw at first glance seemed at least 300.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the door of the warehouse was opened. Sungwoo naturally stepped into the shadow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A man in a sanitary suit came in with a handcart and started hauling a goblin corpse into the cart. The next moment, a hand protruding from the shadow grabbed his neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kheeeee!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shut up. Just answer my questions.” </div><h2 id="chapter239">Chapter 239</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>The man nodded silently. Feeling the tremendous grip on his neck, the man could not dare to resist.<br/><br/>“Is this the core research facility of the Evolution Society?”<br/><br/>The man nodded again without any hesitation. He wanted to live.<br/><br/>“Is Dr. Yu, the head of the Evolution Society, staying in this facility?”<br/><br/>He hesitated for a moment but soon nodded.<br/><br/>“Good, I think I’ve come to the right place. Is he in the basement?”<br/><br/>He nodded for the last time. Sungwoo quickly broke the man’s neck, and he immediately summoned five troll skeletons.<br/><br/>“Pile up the corpses near the wall.”<br/><br/>The troll skeletons moved in unison, moving the corpses of the monsters piled up in the warehouse.<br/><br/>“Now let them know that I am here!”<br/><br/>This place, the corpse warehouse, was like an ammunition warehouse for him. Looking at the wall with about 20 corpses piled up, Sungwoo shouted ‘Explode!’.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>One side of the wall was blown away with a thundering noise, vibration, and heat. Sunlight poured in as the black smoke went out of the wall.<br/><br/>At that moment, the red headlights turned on and the siren rang. People yelling at each other were heard outside the building. The security guards began to react quickly.<br/><br/>“It’s an explosion! Check out what’s going on!”<br/><br/>“This is Tower A! Tower A! Support us!”<br/><br/>It didn’t take long for their voices to turn into screams.<br/><br/>“They are intruders!”<br/><br/>“Shoot! Shoot them! …Argh!”<br/><br/>The security guards near the collapsed wall began to be attacked by something.<br/><br/>“Damn it! They’re so fast!”<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>Short screams continued then their voices faded out one by one, followed by a long silence.<br/><br/>They were annihilated.<br/><br/>“I’m here!” A little later, Jisu walked through the collapsed wall.<br/><br/>“Let’s go down.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was already done piling up the corpses on the floor. He didn’t want to use the elevators or stairs. He planned to use a faster and more efficient method.<br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/>As the corpses turned into flames, the whole floor sank. When concrete bounced and pipes buckled, there opened a passage down to the next floor.<br/><br/>It was a very easy intrusion method no one could block.<br/><br/>“Cough! Cough! What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>“The ceiling has collapsed!”<br/><br/>Somebody was talking under the floor. Players wearing white gowns appeared as if they were in the labs.<br/><br/>“What is going on upstairs? Are there any survivors?”<br/><br/>Instead of answering, Sungwoo sent down ghouls.<br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeh! Kueeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/>“Shit, what the heck is this?”<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhhh! Help me!”<br/><br/>Shortly afterward, the troll skeletons threw a bunch of corpses down the pit.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was thinking of keeping going down if he could penetrate like this.<br/><br/>Since this research facility was large, it was more likely that they hid important stuff on the lower floors of the facility.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there was lots of noise outside the building.<br/><br/>“Encircle the holes in the wall!”<br/><br/>“Riot team on standby!”<br/><br/>A large number of reinforcements arrived at the facility to help the remaining Evolution Society members and surrounded it, but Sungwoo beckoned one of the troll skeletons.<br/><br/>“Give them some gifts, so they won’t feel bored while waiting.”<br/><br/>Then, the troll skeleton moved and threw a few orc corpses out of the holes.<br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/>At the same time, the corpse explosion occurred, the riot team approaching the wall was smashed on the spot.<br/><br/>“Argh! It’s the Breath of Abyss!”<br/><br/>“Gas! Gas! Put on the masks, everyone!”<br/><br/>When the corpses exploded, a faint amount of Breath of Abyss was released, but the Evolution Society dealt with such things, so they had some protective measures at hand.<br/><br/>“Let’s go down. We don’t have to care about them.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu stood in front of a pit going underground.<br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/>The floor began to collapse as an explosion occurred downstairs. At the same time, Sungwoo and Jisu leaped down, so they passed through two holes at once, broke through two floors, and landed on the second basement level.<br/><br/>Unlike the lab on the upper floor, it was a very dark space.<br/><br/>“This place is…”<br/><br/>One line message appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/>-Field Boss Monster ‘Durahan’ has appeared.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>“Boss monster?”<br/><br/>They looked around at the unexpected message. They didn’t expect this kind of situation at all.<br/><br/>A dungeon couldn’t be in a place like this. How could a Field Boss Monster be inside a building?<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, look over there!”<br/><br/>Jisu noticed something. In the middle of the huge room, three water tanks were glowing with purple light.<br/><br/>The first tank contained a body with a severed head. It was a huge figure in iron armor.<br/><br/>The second tank contained the severed head. A faint glow spread from the eyes of the iron helmet. It seemed to be the owner of the body in the first tank.<br/><br/>The third tank contained a black horse. At first glance, it wasn’t ordinary. It was twice as big as a typical horse, and a purple flame was rising from its hooves.<br/><br/>Also known as Dullahan, he was commonly known as a headless knight riding a ghost horse.<br/><br/>“I think he is in custody.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, you’re right.”<br/><br/>White chains were wrapped around the surface of the tank. It seemed to be sacred magic that could restrict traits of the undead.<br/><br/>As a group studying death, they hunted and studied the monsters related to the undead. Previously, they did the same thing when they caught the raid boss monster, Ghoul King, in the secret facility in Beomgye Station and used him as research material.<br/><br/>At that moment, Durahan stretched out his left hand and touched the tank’s glass.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>The white chain reacted, and Durahan’s body stiffened as if he were electrically shocked. Then, he was pushed to the center of the tank.<br/><br/>‘It seemed like he asked me for something just a moment ago.’<br/><br/>Although it was very brief, Sungwoo felt that way.<br/><br/>[Exclusive Quest]<br/><br/>-Title: Chivalry of the Dead<br/><br/>-Type: Rescue<br/><br/>-Goal: Remove the seal of ‘Durahan’<br/><br/>-Reward: ‘Durahan’ loyalty<br/><br/>*Detained in a remote place, the field boss monster ‘Durahan’ has sensed your immense death power, and he is asking for your help. If you save Durahan, he will voluntarily be your subordinate spirit and pledge eternal allegiance.<br/><br/>*’Durahan’ will not follow you unless you release his seal.<br/><br/>“Great. Good decision!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo felt once again the Evolution Society was the richest source of nutrients for the Necromancer.<br/><br/>The three huge tanks containing Durahan, and the white chains surrounding the tanks were devices made of divine magic.<br/><br/>-Divine power denies you access.<br/><br/>*Damage is inflicted by direct contact with the object.<br/><br/>The Necromancer couldn’t break it because it was not made to contain the undead.<br/><br/>“No, I can’t cut it off.”<br/><br/>Just in case, Jisu tried breaking it, but in vain. She couldn’t.<br/><br/>According to the quest, Sungwoo had to break the seal himself in order to gain Durahan’s loyalty, so he needed another way to break it.<br/><br/>“This chain leads to the other room.”<br/><br/>Finally, he found the clue. The white chains surrounding the tanks were running out of the door along the wall.<br/><br/>“I think there is something out there.”<br/><br/>“Let’s go.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu opened the door casually for the first time after entering this building.<br/><br/>Clink―<br/><br/>“They came out!”<br/><br/>“Fire!”<br/><br/>Pick! Pick! Pick!<br/><br/>As soon as the two opened the door, a barrage of arrows with light were fired at them.<br/><br/>It seemed that the arrows contained lethal, sacred power.<br/><br/>However, as long as she was there, there was no way they could inflict any damage.<br/><br/>When she stepped forward and drew her sword, all the arrows flying at her bounced away. She could block them easily now.<br/><br/>“This is nonsense!”<br/><br/>While they were stunned, they put up their shields, a total of ten. All of them were protected by divine power.<br/><br/>Since this was the room where they detained Durahan, it seemed that most of the people involved in this facility had jobs using divine power, such as paladin and priest, and they numbered a whopping 32.<br/><br/>“The intruder is the Necromancer, as expected. Prepare the cleansing spell!”<br/><br/>“Spread Shield of Life!”<br/><br/>“Light Arrows: fully loaded!”<br/><br/>They began to prepare all sorts of divine magic to confront the Necromancer. As he was of the same kind as Durahan, they seemed to believe that their operation would work.<br/><br/>But they seemed to have overlooked Jisu standing next to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Tramp– Tramp–<br/><br/>Jisu pulled out her sword and walked forward. At that moment, the blue flame on her shoulder was absorbed by the blade.<br/><br/>Hwaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/>With the blade dyed with the blue light, a powerful wave began to spread.<br/><br/>Shortly afterward, as she wielded her sword, dozens of blue sword energy attacks spewed out.<br/><br/>They had no choice but to look blankly at the intense energy from her sword.<br/><br/>Kwagagagaga! </div><h2 id="chapter240">Chapter 240</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>When she swung her sword only once, the entire room was crushed. The sharp and quick sword energy attacks ripped through the ceiling, floor, and wall, leaving behind cracks and dents everywhere.<br/><br/>In particular, those who were hit directly by the sword energy suffered terrible damage.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! My arms!”<br/><br/>“Help me!”<br/><br/>“Damn it! Keep the ranks!”<br/><br/>About a third of them were killed on the spot. It was as if the space itself was slaughtered.<br/><br/>This was a skill called ‘blade storm’, in which powerful energy got immersed in a knife before being scattered. So, the more it was used in a narrow space, the more its destructive power would be doubled like a shotgun.<br/><br/>“She’s coming! Stop her!”<br/><br/>“Hey, keep the ranks! Organize the ranks!”<br/><br/>Jisu jumped through their broken shields.<br/><br/>Whenever she swung the sword, their shields were crushed and their metal armor was cut like a tofu.<br/><br/>Sungwoo lifted the repeating crossbow while she threw herself into the middle of the enemy camp and broke their formation. Since they were distracted by her in front, they could not defend Sungwoo’s attack on their left and right.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>Sungwoo fired the arrows at their sides endlessly. When Jisu was helped by these strong reinforcements, they could no longer withstand their combined attack.<br/><br/>After all, the 32 special forces formed to defeat the field boss monster ‘Durahan’ were wiped out in just a few minutes.<br/><br/>“Whew! let’s go again.”<br/><br/>After getting rid of the obstructors, Sunwoo and Jisu moved along the white chains that emanated from the tank.<br/><br/>“That’s it.”<br/><br/>As expected, a white chain was connected to a device at the end.<br/><br/>It was a rectangular electronic device. There were three chains plugged in like outlets.<br/><br/>And a white crystal was spinning in the small groove of the electronic device.<br/><br/>When Sungwoo approached the device, a message about it appeared.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Holy Power Unit (H2)<br/><br/>-Class: Unknown<br/><br/>-Category: Player manufacturing<br/><br/>-Effect: Those in the clergy profession can charge it by injecting mana. ( Wizard-type can’t) When fully charged, it generates ‘Purification Energy’ for 90 minutes.<br/><br/>-Description: Needs to be fully charged every 1 hour. Please manage it 24 hours well because of the shift work. You should never get distracted! Never! Never! (Manufacturer’s skill)<br/><br/>Jisu said, “If I break this, I think we can unseal the tank.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded, and lifted the Grim Reaper. Then he struck down the tank with it.<br/><br/>Cling!<br/><br/>The crystal was shattered to pieces at once.<br/><br/>Then, as if the electric current was cut off, the white light flowing in along the chain began to fade. The supply of “purification energy” mentioned in the item description was cut off.<br/><br/>“Let’s go again.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu returned to the room where Durahan was.<br/><br/>“The chain has gotten loose.”<br/><br/>Like she said, the white chain wrapped around the tank let down loosely.<br/><br/>Sungwoo boldly approached the water tank. Even though he got closer than before, there was no warning message stating that “the divine power is denying your access”.<br/><br/>‘Good.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo lifted the Grim Reaper. Then he forcefully struck down the tank containing the body of Durahan. A hole was made in the tank, and an opaque liquid began to flow out.<br/><br/>Soon the crack spread out to the front, then the tank was broken as if exploded.<br/><br/>At the same time, the giant knight who was immersed in the liquid moved slowly.<br/><br/>Rattle―<br/><br/>As he took his first step out of the tank, the liquid that accumulated in the armor flowed down.<br/><br/>The knight turned to Sungwoo. Even without a head, he was a giant much taller than Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/>Since he wore a gray armor covering his entire body, he looked much heavier.<br/><br/>Even though he stood still, a purple smoke rose above his shoulders, suggesting that he had an extraordinary power.<br/><br/>He now stood tall before Sungwoo. Since he didn’t have a head, it was not clear whether he was looking at Sungwoo now.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo?”<br/><br/>At that moment Jisu placed her hand on the hilt while staying on alert against Durahan.<br/><br/>Her sharp senses told her that this neckless knight had something like murderous intentions.<br/><br/>It was an ominous omen that she felt when her opponent was about to attack.<br/><br/>Actually he was raising her right hand and pulling down the bayonet he was holding around.<br/><br/>He dragged a huge steel bayonet on the marble floor, making a sharp friction.<br/><br/>The next moment, he lifted up the heavy bayonet, and grabbed it with both hands and struck him.<br/><br/>The second and third tanks collapsed one after another.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>A head and a black horse bounced out of the tanks. Durahan picked up his head, which dropped to the floor, with his left hand, and then stuck the bayonet in his right hand to the floor.<br/><br/>Then he knelt in front of Sungwoo.<br/><br/>-Field boss monster ‘Durahan’ pledges loyalty to you.<br/><br/>* This monster has become your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/>-You have successfully attacked the exclusive quest ‘Chival of the Dead’.<br/><br/>* Rewards are given. (Special subordinate spirit)<br/><br/>What Jiu felt from Durahan was his attack instinct. But his target was not Sungwoo.<br/><br/>At that moment somebody made some noise from the hold of the ceiling through which Sungwoo and Jisu came down.<br/><br/>“I think it’s down there!”<br/><br/>Several flashlight lights flashed out of the hole and shook back and forth. However, because the room was so spacious, it seemed that they didn’t yet find Sungwoo and Jisu.<br/><br/>“There are no holes on the second basement floor!”<br/><br/>“Okay, it seems they are on the second basement level. Striker Team, get ready to attack them! Go down and chase the intruders.”<br/><br/>It seemed that the security forces of the Evolution Society were chasing Sungwoo and Jisu. Soon, those guards with crossbows jumped down to the second basement floor.<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at Durahan and said, “Now, show me your loyalty.”<br/><br/>Durahan raised his huge body. Holding his head in his left hand, he rode a huge black horse. Then he pulled up the bayonet stuck on the floor.<br/><br/>When this big giant climbed on the monster black horse twice as large as a normal horse, he was literally overwhelming.<br/><br/>-‘Synergy effect’ is given by team play.<br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/>-Category: Personal synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: A moving creature without a head<br/><br/>-Effect: Increases the probability of critical strike avoidance (+100%), complete immunity to instant death, increase immunity to shock (+50%), complete immunity to faint, complete immunity to mental-type curses<br/><br/>The synergy content was so extreme that Sungwoo recalled a one-armed warrior. Could he freely move even in all kinds of critical conditions because he had no head?<br/><br/>The next moment the monster horse kicked off the ground. The giant knight bounced into the darkness. It was such a fierce charge that could be described as lightning speed.<br/><br/>Whenever the black monster hit the ground, purple flames erupted from its hooves. That light reached the enemy in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>“Something is coming toward us!”<br/><br/>The guards who came down from the hole noticed that something was approaching them, and very fast at that. They bent down and lit lanterns at the purple flames.<br/><br/>“What the heck! That is …”<br/><br/>“Dura…”<br/><br/>But it’s too late. Durahan passed by them, leaving behind a destructive and cruel scene as if a huge truck swept through the sidewalk.<br/><br/>Six guards were struck by the horse and crushed in its hoofs. Four were beheaded by Durahan. With a single stroke Duran killed half of the security guards.<br/><br/>“Damn it! What the hell…”<br/><br/>“Durahan has been freed! He’s coming back! Get prepared!”<br/><br/>The death rider Durahan who briefly disappeared into the darkness turned the reins toward them. Purple flames circling in the dark began to sweep over the guards.<br/><br/>Although they were hit by Durahan, they had no time to prepare for his second attack because he was too fast.<br/><br/>Besides, his attack was different this time.<br/><br/>-Durahan uses his exclusive skill ‘Death Run’.<br/><br/>A purple horse-drawn knight squad appeared on his sides. It was a total of eight ghost knights in translucent form.<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck?”<br/><br/>“Everybody, avoid them!”<br/><br/>The ghost knight squad maintained their ranks with Durahan as the center, and lowered the Lance. The entire building of the Evolution Society shook heavily as if a tram pushed in.<br/><br/>What came next was what was expected. All the security guards were smashed by the squad without any exception. They were shredded, bounced off, and trampled. It was literally annihilation.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Durahan slowly slowed down, leaving behind the enemies’ bodies. Suddenly, his ghost knight squad on both sides disappeared. And there wasn’t even a scream left on the road he passed by<br/><br/>Purrrrrrrrrrrr―<br/><br/>The monster horse was still blowing out a thick breeze.<br/><br/>“Great…” Sungwoo muttered in satisfaction.<br/><br/>He was even thrilled with expectation that he might find some kind of gift waiting for him if he went down deeper. </div><h2 id="chapter241">Chapter 241</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            It wasn’t easy to recognize the shape of the trampled corpses strewn here and there because they were run over by the mounted ghost knights.<br/><br/>Purrrrrrr―<br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded, watching the tragic massacre that took place in just a few seconds.<br/><br/>He was confident that Durahan would be an important force in the future.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was satisfied with his performance. So, Sungwoo put him in the “Void Haven.”<br/><br/>“Now, let’s stop going down further. Let’s go inside instead.”<br/><br/>Since he found out that the security guards were chasing them, he needed to change the route of their movement. Even if Sungwoo and Jisu were not discovered by the chasing guards, any further delay would give DOCTOR more time to prepare a counter attack.<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu came out through the corridor on the second basement floor.<br/><br/>After destroying all CCTVs around them, they checked the “facility map” attached to the wall.<br/><br/>After examining it, Sungwoo realized they were in the ‘Abyss Research Sample Center’.<br/><br/>“Abyss Research Sample? Does it mean the undead?” Jisu asked.<br/><br/>“I think so.”<br/><br/>As Jisu guessed, there were a series of containment facilities installed along the corridor, containing undead monsters such as zombies, ghouls, and skeletons.<br/><br/>The room where Durahan was located was the most secure facility at the end of the corridor.<br/><br/>‘If I had been caught, I would have been contained in a room next to Durahan’s.’<br/><br/>These guys would clearly have considered Sungwoo as the most important specimen.<br/><br/>He felt terrible when he thought about it.<br/><br/>“Well, looking at the map, the 5th basement floor is the lowest. Do you think he is there?” she asked, pointing at the very end of the facility map.<br/><br/>“I think so.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu moved along the corridor. On both sides of the corridor, all kinds of undead were trapped in iron bars where the “purification energy” flowed.<br/><br/>However, perhaps because they felt the power of death possessed by Sungwoo, the undead stepped back whenever Sungwoo passed by as if they were paying homage to him.<br/><br/>Sungwoo found a familiar face inside the iron bars at the end. It wasn’t undead.<br/><br/>“Necromancer.”<br/><br/>It was none other than the white Werewolf with the capabilities of psychometry.<br/><br/>“It’s already our third meeting,” the Werewolf said casually, leaning against the wall.<br/><br/>“I know you’re not supposed to be trapped in a place like this. Aren’t you, Great Wizard of the Four Human Beasts?”<br/><br/>He was the “the Bearer of White” among the four human beasts leading the human beasts of the Korean servers, but he was so miserable and shabby now. Trapped inside the iron bars, he was wearing a thick chain around his neck: a prisoner.<br/><br/>“Well, I had no other choice but to collapse when I became weak. I was nothing but a hound, after all.”<br/><br/>He laughed bitterly.<br/><br/>“Was there a power struggle here?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/>Sungwoo remembered the enslaved human beasts when he infiltrated into this building. So, he judged there was a power struggle within the Evolutionary Society. The white wolf’s camp was defeated, given his current situation.<br/><br/>“Power struggle? From the beginning, everything was a race for survival. We fell prey to their game because we didn’t choose the cards.”<br/><br/>There was resentment in his voice.<br/><br/>Sungwoo asked cynically, “Is terrorism part of the race for survival?”<br/><br/>The terror of the Breath of Abyss they committed at Yeongdeungpo Station was unforgivable. The white wolf hung his head and slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“If all of those were quests issued by the system, could you believe it? What if the system forced us to attack you?”<br/><br/>The first quest given to the human beasts was to eat ten players. As a reward, the system restored their reason. Based on that, the system wasn’t hoping for harmony between the players and the human beasts.<br/><br/>The white wolf continued.<br/><br/>“So, the system punished us for not choosing cards by forcing us to become beasts. Then, the system used us for its extreme purposes, namely as hostile forces against you guys, the main players of the game.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t know that was the main purpose of the system’s creation of human beasts.<br/><br/>“But it was up to you to proceed with the quest, right?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/>“That’s right. We chose to do it so easily because we just wanted to survive even if we became beasts. We knew it was bad, but we decided to adapt to the system. We’re not asking for your forgiveness. We’re villains without any excuses and nothing can change that.”<br/><br/>As he said, no matter what the circumstances involving the human beasts, nothing changed. They are Sungwoo’s enemies. So, Sungwoo intended to kill all of them.<br/><br/>But if the human beasts had not conformed to the system, would Sungwoo have made a different choice? Sungwoo did not think about it longer.<br/><br/>‘No, they must have conformed to the system and attacked the players.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo also acted freely to survive. After all, the greatest evil was the ‘system.’<br/><br/>“Necromancer, I don’t want you to understand us. However, I will help you to get rid of the leader of the Evolution Society…”<br/><br/>“Dr. Yu?”<br/><br/>The white wolf nodded and said, “It’s embarrassing, but we were used by him from the beginning. He pretended to help us after we were turned into human beasts, but he used us as his slaves and materials for experiments. In the end, we couldn’t stand it and rebelled but ended up being slaves like this.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo once again wondered if he could believe what the white wolf just said. However, it was clear that this could not be Dr. Yu’s trap.<br/><br/>It meant that at least he could get useful information from the white wolf.<br/><br/>“Where is this bastard, Dr. Yu?”<br/><br/>The white wolf stood up from its seat and pointed to the floor.<br/><br/>“He is probably in a hidden room on the eighth basement level of this building. Maybe Dr. Yu is also ready to meet you.”<br/><br/>“Ready?”<br/><br/>“Yes, he is serving another race, not the Absolute Race. Probably, he is trying to use the power of that weird halo. I recommend you go down there quickly before he does it. The 6th to 8th basement floors are restricted areas, so it will be very difficult for you to penetrate them.”<br/><br/>As expected, the 5th basement floor marked on the map was not the final floor. There was a larger facility beneath it.<br/><br/>‘As expected, he seems to be preparing something just in case I came to this place. I don’t know what will happen if I give this guy more time.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked into the white wolf’s eyes and said, “I think you know there is a way for me to go down there easily.”<br/><br/>Since the white wolf was once an executive of the Evolution Society, he probably had more detailed information. Sungwoo needed it.<br/><br/>The white wolf smiled for the first time, then said, “If you promise not to kill our human beasts living as slaves after killing Dr. Yu, I’ll tell you. They were skeptical about killing players in the first place.”<br/><br/>The white wolf offered the human beasts’ lives and freedom as the condition.<br/><br/>“Then, let me also tell you my premise. Regardless of the system, promise that you guys will live quietly in a remote place when you are saved.”<br/><br/>“Sure, I promise. I know we will be killed by you if I break that promise.”<br/><br/>“Then, tell me how to get to Dr. Yu, quickly.”<br/><br/>“This facility is circular. If you break through the wall over there in the 12 o’clock direction, you’ll see a secret elevator. It’s the only direct passage down to the 8th basement level.”<br/><br/>“Is it safe?”<br/><br/>“I do not know. I don’t know what he might have done there, but there is no other passage that will take you there as fast as it does. Otherwise, you’ll have to break through some tough security guards.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo turned right away. He could not afford to stay there any longer.<br/><br/>“Hey, Necromancer!”<br/><br/>The white wolf grabbed the iron bars and shouted a warning.<br/><br/>“As for the one that Dr. Yu is serving, I don’t know what it is! But it’s a wicked creature with tremendous force! You have to be careful about that creature. Remember!”<br/><br/>It didn’t matter what the creature was.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was determined to confront an unknown “creator”, not to mention the Absolute Race that he declared as his enemy from the beginning. </div><h2 id="chapter242">Chapter 242</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            According to the white wolf’s advice, Sungwoo went towards the 12 o’clock direction. When he destroyed the wall, a huge vertical passage appeared.<br/><br/>“Yeah, this is the elevator he mentioned,” Jisu said.<br/><br/>It looked like a passage through which only a secret elevator moved.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo stuck his head out and checked inside it carefully. An unpleasant wind blew from inside, but there was nothing but darkness in the bottomless pit.<br/><br/>The 8th basement floor was only 5 stories below them, but it looked quite deep because the stairs were rather high.<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned some zombie monsters and slowly went down with Jisu. Fortunately, there was nothing that stood in their way until they reached the 8th basement floor.<br/><br/>Jisu, who always mobilized all her senses to monitor her surroundings, felt more relaxed.<br/><br/>“There is no resistance. It’s quiet,” she said.<br/><br/>“I think he gave us the correct direction,” Sungwoo responded.<br/><br/>If Sungwoo and Jisu had tried to crush the stairs and elevators, not to mention the floor, to go down to the 8th floor, they would have encountered considerable resistance along the way.<br/><br/>“We’re almost there,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/>Finally, they arrived on the last floor of the core building of the Evolution Society headquarters, the 8th basement floor.<br/><br/>“There is only one road,” Jisu said.<br/><br/>A huge horizontal passage like a tunnel unfolded before them. Unlike the research facility on the upper floor, it was a space that had not been maintained at all.<br/><br/>As if it was left behind after a huge creature dug through the ground, there was no trace of human touch at all.<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu stepped inside. They walked through the passage for quite a long time.<br/><br/>Whooooooooo-<br/><br/>At that moment, an unpleasant wind began to blow. The wind was flowing from deep in the horizontal passage.<br/><br/>“It’s hot.”<br/><br/>As Jisu said, the wind blowing from the basement was quite humid and hot.<br/><br/>So much so that they would be burned if the hot wind touched their skin.<br/><br/>She wiped off her sweat, revealing her anxiety.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, it keeps getting hot quickly. If it’s this hot…”<br/><br/>Even though they didn’t go deep inside, the wind’s temperature was rising rapidly. They could hardly breathe in now. It was ominous. Jisu keenly felt the unknown threat right around the corner better than anyone else.<br/><br/>The next moment, she was astonished to find something.<br/><br/>“This is a dangerous place! We have to get out of here right now!”<br/><br/>Goo Goo Goo Goo!<br/><br/>Soon, a tremendous vibration shook the entire passage where they were standing.<br/><br/>Something huge was pouring out through the hot passage.<br/><br/>“Step back!” Sungwoo shouted at her.<br/><br/>Sungwoo then pulled Jisu back right away and summoned “Bone Drake” and “Bone Wyvern Alpha Male” right in front of him to use them as protective shields. As expected, the two monsters completely blocked the huge passage. At the same time, Sungwoo formed a bone shield and stuck it into the floor.<br/><br/>Soon, the front of the passage began to glow orange. Something hot was very close to them.<br/><br/>‘It is fire. An incredible fire pouring out.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu had no time to escape. They would have no choice but to collide with it.<br/><br/>“Get out quickly! I’ll be blocking it! I have fire immunity!” Sungwoo shouted at Jisu.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Sungwoo had 40% fire immunity thanks to the title of “Professional Dragon Hunter”, and he got 30% fire immunity and 70% fire immunity by combining “Drake’s Leather” with the Shadow King’s robe.<br/><br/>But Jisu had no way to bear the intense heat. So, Sungwoo had the Ogre Skeleton grab her and get her out through the entrance they came through. Then, he summoned more undead to block the cave completely. He had to hold out there until Jisu safely escaped from this place.<br/><br/>– Warning! ‘Underground Rage’ is flaring up!<br/><br/>The intense fire was everywhere, dyeing the area red.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this…?”<br/><br/>It was as hot as, or even more than, the fire of hell he had experienced before.<br/><br/>‘I can’t stand this either!’<br/><br/>Sungwoo stepped back because he realized that even with 70% of flame immunity, he couldn’t withstand it.<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo thought of one item, so he pulled out a small bead-shaped item from his pocket.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Hellfire Armor<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: Reversion item<br/><br/>-Effect: You can use ‘Hellfire Armor’ when you are equipped with it. (Defense +50% Magic Immunity +30% Fire Immunity +100%, Fire Damage Increase +20%)<br/><br/>-Description: When you are equipped with it, the size of the item is automatically adjusted to your body. You can’t take it off once you wear it.<br/><br/>It was an item Sungwoo obtained by killing the Hell Moving Armor, the flame from hell.<br/><br/>When Sungwoo wore it, his fire immunity increased by 100%. As a result, if he added the 70% immunity he currently possessed, his immunity would reach 170%.<br/><br/>-Would you like to wear ‘Hellfire Armor’? (Y/N)<br/><br/>* This is a reversion item. You can’t take it off once you wear it. (However, when you don’t want to use it, you can store it in the form of mana in the ‘pattern of the wrist’.)<br/><br/>It was a reversion item, but it didn’t mean that he should always wear it. He could store it in an invisible shape, but he could not afford to ponder over it for a long time because a huge column of fire would devour him at any time.<br/><br/>“Wear it!”<br/><br/>-‘Hellfire Armor’ has been applied to you.<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo’s body began to be equipped with the armor.<br/><br/>The black iron armor stretched out across his body then assembled to fit his body.<br/><br/>At the same time, flames rose from all over his body. Of course, it took effect right away.<br/><br/>‘I don’t feel any heat anymore.’<br/><br/>-‘Salamander’s Aura’ is given to you because ‘Fire Immunity’ exceeds the given value (150%).<br/><br/>* A ‘burn’ effect is applied to all your direct attacks.<br/><br/>* If you are hit by a ‘flame attack’, your health will be restored. (+1%)<br/><br/>With that message, the red flames covering his body began to change into blue flames.<br/><br/>‘It feels cool rather than hot.’<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough, Sungwoo didn’t feel the intense heat of the cave anymore.<br/><br/>The higher the temperature of the fire, the closer it was to blue. Sungwoo’s body was hotter than the overwhelming flames emanating from the passage.<br/><br/>The next moment, a swirling wave of the flames rushed in. The column of fire had finally arrived.<br/><br/>Quaguaguaguagua!<br/><br/>All the undead quickly turned into ash in the intense heat of the fire. It wasn’t the kind of heat that they could endure.<br/><br/>The column of fire swallowed up Sungwoo. A tremendous roar, so powerful it almost tore through his eardrums, shook his auricle. The outer walls of the cave were shattered by the heat, and a pile of dirt flew behind him. Like the blade of a mixer, the column of fire swept over everything inside the passage.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo could easily withstand the heat and stand firmly in his place. It looked like he was facing a strong wind.<br/><br/>Ooh ooh ooh-<br/><br/>Soon, as if a gust of wind passed by, the powerful column of fire disappeared behind him.<br/><br/>Sungwoo took off the hood he was wearing.<br/><br/>“If this was all the attack you prepared, it’s my turn…”<br/><br/>Soon, green eyes lit up one by one amidst the burnt ashes, and hundreds of undead began to resurrect immediately.<br/><br/>“You are finished!” Sungwoo shouted at the boss monster.<br/><br/>The Necromancer’s undead army began to advance along the path the huge flames swept across moments.<br/><br/>Jisu was safe because Sungwoo quickly pulled her back and evacuated her to the point where the flames could not reach her.<br/><br/>Before he advanced to chase the boss monster, he said to her, “We never know how far this road will go, and if you face the flames in the middle of the road, you won’t be able to avoid it. So, please defend in the rear.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo wanted her not to go further down the road, but to stay behind and wait for his return.<br/><br/>She couldn’t hide her displeased expression, but he was right. If she went further recklessly, she would most likely be killed for no good reason.<br/><br/>“Understood. But if I don’t see any flames coming out after you enter it, let me go in then.”<br/><br/>“You must be careful, though.”<br/><br/>Jisu was a stubborn woman. She hated being a burden on him.<br/><br/>“Then, see you later.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo went into the passage. His undead troops were already waiting to go with him. </div><h2 id="chapter243">Chapter 243</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Sungwoo passed through a horizontal passage with Minsok.<br/><br/>“Necromancer, I can see the end of the road over there.”<br/><br/>“It’s shorter than I thought.”<br/><br/>The horizontal passage had elevations, but it was generally straight. So, it didn’t take long for them to reach the end.<br/><br/>The end of the passage led to a huge cavity. The stairs on the 8th basement level were quite high, and this cavity was also over 20 meters from the floor to the ceiling.<br/><br/>Sungwoo stood tall in the great darkness and lifted the lantern.<br/><br/>“That thing is…”<br/><br/>He found something strange. There was a rather bizarre thing stuck to the wall facing the passage.<br/><br/>Chomp! Chomp! Chomp!<br/><br/>It was a human’s mouth. A huge mouth, about 10 meters wide, protruded from one wall.<br/><br/>Chomp! Chomp! Chomp! Chomp! Chomp!<br/><br/>His pale lips were dry with stiff, dead skin, and each time the mouth opened, saliva dripped through the yellow teeth. From time to time, its black tongue was seen wriggling.<br/><br/>It murmured all the time as if it were chewing on something, but a loud disgusting noise echoed loudly as if to match its huge size.<br/><br/>“What the hell is this?” Minsok also couldn’t hide his displeasure.<br/><br/>“It seems like it’s spitting out fire.”<br/><br/>“Fire?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo noticed that his mouth was the origin of a huge column of fire sweeping the horizontal passage because the nearby floor was unusually charcoaled.<br/><br/>“How about tearing that mouth off?”<br/><br/>“I hate to go close to it, but let me do it.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned his subordinate spirits to attack the mouth. He was worried that it would breathe out flames, but it made little resistance as if it was not ready yet.<br/><br/>It just flapped its lips and screamed a disgusting sound, then quickly stuck out its tongue and stopped moving.<br/><br/>-By removing the ‘Unknown Existence’, you have incurred the anger of the ‘Unknown Existence’.<br/><br/>‘What the heck is this?’<br/><br/>Incurring his anger? What does it mean? Unknown existence?<br/><br/>It was never a good sign that the system was hiding something.<br/><br/>‘Is it the thing that Dr. Yu is serving? The white wolf has warned me about it.’<br/><br/>This seemed to have something to do with the “existence” that the white wolf said he didn’t know about in detail, but Sungwoo could not figure out anything right now. To get the clue, he had no other choice but to go deeper.<br/><br/>“There is a door over here!”<br/><br/>Minseok found a large door on one side of the cavity. It was a sealed door made of stainless steel, and the light was leaking out through a small gap. It seemed that a little normal space was about to appear.<br/><br/>Sungwoo did not approach it directly but sent a Werewolf skeleton to open the door.<br/><br/>But when he reached out and tried to grab the doorknob, the door opened by itself.<br/><br/>Then, a little boy came out of the door.<br/><br/>“Nice to meet you. Welcome to the ‘Abnormal Response Center’, a special organization under the Ministry of Public Administration and Security of the Republic of Korea.”<br/><br/>He, who was combing his hair straight, was wearing a bow tie on his tuxedo.<br/><br/>Unsuitable for this place, he had an aura like the son of a nobleman.<br/><br/>“Who are you?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/>“I will escort you, Necromancer,” he said in a gentle tone that wasn’t appropriate for his age. However, Sungwoo raised the repeating crossbow. He had no reason to refrain from firing an arrow just because the other party was a child.<br/><br/>“Escort me? Don’t you think you are playing a dirty trick on me so blatantly?”<br/><br/>“Yes. Because you are so powerful, they sent me to try to persuade you,” he said with a smile.<br/><br/>Only then was Sungwoo convinced that he was not a child.<br/><br/>He only looked like a child.<br/><br/>‘If that’s the case, this guy must be…’<br/><br/>Sungwoo realized that he was DOCTOR, obviously one of the clones in this core facility.<br/><br/>At first glance, he looked like the previous clone a lot.<br/><br/>That meant Sungwoo had finally reached the heart of the core facility where Dr. Yu was located.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo was sharply alert.<br/><br/>‘I should not be outwitted by this guy.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo has always won the fight against this man, but he has always come up with an unexpected card. So, Sungwoo knew if he let down his guard carelessly, he could fall into a trap set by this guy.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo secretly summoned “Spector”.<br/><br/>“Did you say it was the government?”<br/><br/>“That’s right.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo showed a willingness to talk with him a little more. Then, he smiled brightly.<br/><br/>“Do you want to say you are the government?”<br/><br/>“I belonged to the government. I was a member of the Abnormal Response Center, also known as ‘S·P·R·C’, one of the research institutes under the Ministry of Public Administration and Security.”<br/><br/>The guy opened the door, and he beckoned to Sungwoo and Minsok to come politely.<br/><br/>So, they entered the door and stepped into a white corridor.<br/><br/>“The government was predicting this situation on its own. They found out that some external forces were trying to engage and control the Earth.”<br/><br/>That was pretty surprising. Did they also know in advance that the world was turning into a game?<br/><br/>“But the government didn’t help you at all, right? After this incident, the government disappeared without a trace. They just collapsed even without withstanding the first half of this game,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/>“That’s right. Only the working-level researchers of S·P·R·C believed that and gave a warning, but the high-ranking government ministries with money and authority didn’t want to believe such a warning. The world turning into a game? Which politician would trust the findings of such a study?”<br/><br/>Thump- Thump-<br/><br/>The three walked along a white corridor lit by LED lights. They saw a white door at the end.<br/><br/>“On the day the game started, Dr. Hee-Seung Yu, the head of the center, and the researchers under him responded. At the same time the game started, they selected 4,000 survivors and evacuated them to this facility, and by creating an independent system, they started preparing for the future.”<br/><br/>Hee-Seung Yu was the real name of “Dr. Yu,” the head of the Evolution Society. This meant he already knew the world was going to change like this even before the game started.<br/><br/>“What do you mean you prepared something?”<br/><br/>“Well, instead of rebuilding a lost Republic of Korea by an incompetent government, we were planning and implementing a plan to satisfy the ultimate purpose of this incident.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo knew what the plan was. He recalled what he heard when he first met DOCTOR in a secret facility underneath Beomgye Station.<br/><br/>“Ultimate purpose? Is it the new race, or the transcendence that you are talking about?”<br/><br/>The boy smiled brightly when Sungwoo asked as if they were talking about his favorite manga plot. Nodding at Sungwoo, he took delight in his reply.<br/><br/>“That’s right! Dr. Yu, just like others, drew two cards according to the system. The first card was “Mad Scientist.” The second card was “The Archbishop.” As a result, the two cards in pursuit of the truth created synergy, and as such he got closer to the ‘correct answer’ before anyone else.”<br/><br/>“Correct answer?”<br/><br/>“In Dr. Yu’s eyes, this game is sort of a test. It’s a test that a certain being has given to judge the worth of humans.”<br/><br/>The guy got more excited and started talking more.<br/><br/>“So, we studied how to pass the test. Haha! I mean the way to break away from the classic form of humanity and move on to becoming a bigger being! That’s why we were studying ‘death’, the biggest challenge that humans could not solve. Necromancer, you can be of great help in that research. Would you like to talk with us in more detail? Maybe you might understand us…”<br/><br/>“You’re wrong.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo threw cold water over his offer. At that moment his face hardened.<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>Then, the guy stopped suddenly in the middle of the hallway.<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked down at him and chuckled.<br/><br/>“Well, that transcendental being may be looking down on us, but this is not a test for us.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo fiddled with the scales of the Imoogi in his pocket.<br/><br/>-OFF AIR (-)<br/><br/>Did something more important than Sungwoo happen? The unidentified gaze was not directed at Sungwoo at the moment.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo slowly opened his mouth more comfortably.<br/><br/>“This is nothing other than their entertainment.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo shot back at him more harshly, who could not even respond.<br/><br/>“And you guys are playing a stupid, fanatical villain with vain thoughts!”<br/><br/>The guy made a long face but responded cynically.<br/><br/>“Oh, how rude of you to express your intent so clearly that you won’t agree with our cause!”<br/><br/>“Really? Well, I’m going to be ruder in the future. I won’t forgive you guys then.”<br/><br/>“Sure…” Then the guy stepped aside and raised his right hand and waved it lightly.<br/><br/>“Goodbye!” </div><h2 id="chapter244">Chapter 244</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            The door at the end of the corridor opened wide. Three giant spears made of magic floated in the air. It was clear that given the white glow around its body, the undead had a deadly divine power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m sorry, but I’ve been watching you all along.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo knew early on that such an ugly creature had been aiming at him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ooh ooh ooh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two ghosts popped out of the wall. Just before entering the hallway, Sungwoo summoned Specter to watch over the wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shoot him!” The little guy shouted urgently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled the “mountain goblin’s wooden shield” from his back. At the same time, three spears flew toward Sungwoo at a tremendous speed like missiles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Goong- Goo-goong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The powerful magic was blocked by Sungwoo’s shield and disappeared. Sungwoo succeeded in using the item’s ability to disable the three magic attacks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The little guy was running through the corridor. While he was running, he started whining like a child.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is magic was prepared by ten priests for 20 minutes! It should have killed you right away! How could you stop it?” he shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and Minsok went down the corridor and chased him into the huge cavity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are up there!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Enemies appeared before they could take a closer look. Ten priests were urgently preparing a new magic attack. However, there was something strange about them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With their lower bodies cut off, only the upper bodies were hung from the ceiling on various chains and hoses. Their faces were covered with white hoods.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It seems that they are not moving on their own. They are only puppets,” Minsok said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was right. It was certain that they were priests who dealt with divine magic, but they were only bodies. They seemed to be manipulated like machines.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the sound of the chains winding, their bodies moved while hanging on the strings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, they were placed in a formation to surround Sungwoo and Minsok, then they raised their hands unnaturally. Upon closer examination, wires and hoses were connected to their brains and spines.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo fired at them with his repeating crossbow. In addition to the ignition function, Sungwoo’s fire damage was amplified by the “Salamander’s Aura” effect he obtained by putting on the “Hellfire Armor”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s arrows hit the priests and set them on fire in an instant. They didn’t even scream.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 16,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 14,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 14,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to the system message, they were normal players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t know why, but the players were being controlled by somebody.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How about it? Do you like such players?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A voice came out from one corner. When Sungwoo turned his head toward it, he noticed a D-shaped instrument panel and the young man sitting in front of it stood. He had pomade-slicked hair and was none other than DOCTOR who Sungwoo knew well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It has been my long dream to make the Necromancer like that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, another man appeared behind him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Honestly, this kind of facility doesn’t seem bad, so why don’t you give it a thought? We’re going to cut off your lower body, so you don’t have to worry about feces and urine.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was also DOCTOR, but he looked a little younger. Almost like a high school student.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Behind him was the little guy who escorted Sungwoo at first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The guy opened his mouth with a grumpy expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That man is stubborn. No matter how hard I tried, I could not deceive him. He’s annoying.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching them one by one, Sungwoo could not help but be startled. Did the ‘creator’ make clones according to their age?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is ridiculous. Who else?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>One more appeared immediately when Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There are more. Glad we can meet your expectations.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time it was a middle-aged man, pushing a wheelchair.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo made eye contact with the man in the wheelchair, a gray-haired old man.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The old man scanned Sungwoo then smiled in satisfaction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You have come! The specimen I have been looking forward to came here voluntarily.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That old man was Dr. Hee-Seung Yu’s main body, DOCTOR-000.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Welcome! Watching you from a distance, I was looking forward to seeing you someday. You are the only one who will complete my research…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m sorry, but I’ve come here to smash your study.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the old man just giggled at him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t worry about it. Like those friends up there, I will trim your limbs and let you be held in their arms without complaining,” said the old man, smiling at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo snapped, frowning at him, “The young clones pretended to be gentlemen, but you’ve become an ugly old man speaking like a pervert!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The older you get, the more you reveal your true colors!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After he said that, something began to protrude from the old man’s back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gulp! Gulp!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a bundle of scarlet tentacles. Sungwoo wondered if it was his weapon, but something he could never understand happened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The old man’s tentacles shot forward and stuck in the necks of his clones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, they began to absorb their brain and spinal fluid, as if sipping the contents with a straw.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Huhhhhh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if they knew it already, the clones made no resistance. Their eyes rolled, and their limbs trembled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, you guys have a tight kinship. So, is this what you mean by becoming one body?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dr. Yu, who finished eating them all amid Sungwoo’s scornful jeering, stood up from the wheelchair. He relaxed his neck muscles then slowly walked forward.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s not just us. Someday, everyone will become one body like this. That’s what I call…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, he reached out his hand toward the ceiling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s what I call evolution.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the sound of a switch going up was heard somewhere, and the searchlights installed on the ceiling turned on. The cavity, immersed in darkness, revealed its bare space.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was as spacious as a dome stadium. All kinds of mechanical devices hung from the walls and ceiling, but it wasn’t just the mechanical devices that were hanging.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, My God…” Minsok lamented a little.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hundreds of players lined the ceiling with their lower bodies cut off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their brains and spines were connected with wires and hoses, making it possible for Dr. Yu to remotely control them like the priests.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woooong-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, players hanging from the ceiling with a mechanical sound were transported in a row along the rails. Sungwoo and Minsok felt like they were at a large-scale meat processing site.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of cranes began to separate from the wall and descend.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The cranes also had rails, and bodies being carried from the ceiling took the rails and began to be deployed with different cranes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>From the end of the cranes, two players were stacked one after another until a total of 20 players were fixed on one crane.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the current flowed, the players hanging on the crane took the same action at the same time, such as raising their hands or turning their heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In such a formation, 20 players could use the same magic at the same time with a single command.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pushee―<br/><br/><br/><br/>Black smoke emanated from the rear wall, a hole that looked like a vent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pushee―<br/><br/><br/><br/>The power source driving this huge machine seemed to blow gas through the vent. There, a noisy engine sound rang, making the cavity loud.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woong- Woong- Wooong-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking at the bizarre device moving smoothly, Dr. Yu expressed satisfaction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Isn’t it cool? It’s not yet one body, but it’s controlled under one mind and has one movement.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A bundle of thick cables came down from the center of the ceiling and wriggled like a snake and approached Dr. Yu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Subsequently, a bundle of tentacles stretched out from behind Dr. Yu’s back and began to get tangled with the bundle of cables.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The spark splattered wildly, but Dr. Yu looked fine.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dr. Yu’s body ascended along the bundle of cables. He stopped in the air, in the middle of all those devices.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he slowly raised his hands as if he became a god looking down on the earth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay, this is the early stage of evolution.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo did not hide his disgust.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Evolution?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A huge black sickle appeared in Sungwoo’s right hand. At the same time, black hair spread all over his body as he began to turn into a single black wolf.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You keep talking about evolution…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And finally, a heavy black armor appeared on his body. Blue heat spread from his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was an indescribable kind of power, intertwined with the power of death and intense flames.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You guys deserve extinction!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, it was time for Sungwoo to end their long bad relationship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me annihilate you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The final battle began. </div><h2 id="chapter245">Chapter 245</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Pushee―<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gas was ejected from six exhaust vents of the innermost wall. As if the engine seemed to be getting hotter, the gas jet cycle started to shorten.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, the machines on the ceiling and walls moved faster and faster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ooh ooh ooh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The whole cavity was a huge machine.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dr. Yu’s body was pulled by the cables and soared gradually. Soon, he reached the ceiling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Weeeeeeeeeeng-<br/><br/><br/><br/>A square capsule protruded from the ceiling. Dr. Yu went into it. Then, white patterns began to emerge around the capsule.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately noticed what it was.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It’s divine magic.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The number of patterns was a whopping 22. He hid inside a device with divine magic, so Sunngwoo couldn’t attack him directly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Also, the entrance to the corridor, where Sungwoo and Minsok walked in, closed by itself. And dozens of divine magic were cast there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You guys can’t get out of here anymore.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dr. Yu’s voice rang above their heads. Speakers on the wall resonated with his voice throughout the cavity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Necromancer, if you have the undead, I have dolls. Now, let’s play soldiers.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What he meant by the dolls seemed to refer to the players hanging on the crane.<br/><br/><br/><br/>How could he hang them in such a state that they couldn’t even die, then call them dolls?<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was something only this man, nicknamed ‘Mad Scientist’, could do.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A quest message appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes as if the players who were treated as dolls appealed to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Exclusive Quest]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Title: For rest in peace<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Type: Rescue<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Goal: Deliver death to those who cannot die<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Reward: Exclusive skill<br/><br/><br/><br/>*You witnessed a terrible scene. You have seen those who, deceived by the evil spirits, can’t die, suffering eternal pain. They can feel everything, even though they can’t scream.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Death is not anyone’s right. However, some death may be the only escape from tragedy. You can give them a way out and a resting place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* We must provide rest to all those who cannot die (Total 240 people)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Your choice affects your ‘destiny’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo now understood why such a quest was issued.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, Dr. Yu was moving them here and there after hanging the players with only their upper bodies on a line.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Twelve cranes moved up, down, left, and right to select different positions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Warriors with spears and shields were in the front, shooters with bows and crossbows were in the middle, and priests and wizards in the rear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The sight was bizarre, but it was no different from a normal battle formation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it. I really can’t bear seeing this cruel scene. If they use magic at the same time, it will deal a fatal blow. In particular, the priests in the rear seem to be very dangerous,” said Minsok.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes. Be careful, Minsok!” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how powerful they were, Sungwoo and Minsok had to be wary so as not to be directly hit by a series of divine magic with the opposite trait of ‘death.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘There are a total of 240 people hanging on the crane.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Considering the players Sungwoo had dealt with until now, he had no problem with smashing the 240 players here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘But they are not ordinary 240 players.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The “dolls” Dr. Yu controlled were different. Since he regarded his battle with Sungwoo as the last one, he probably mobilized all his resources to make them strong.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I can see many of the shooters in the middle with silver arrowheads.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo has already experienced fighting against them several times. The silver arrowheads were weapons that made the undead impossible to resurrect.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, as it was quite difficult to produce them, not all the players were armed with them, but they were the forces Sungwoo had to be most concerned with.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Watch out for snipers, especially the silver arrows.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I know what they are. Understood.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Moreover, the army controlled by one man was more efficient than anything else.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Because they had no emotion, they could be operated as a program without any delay.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo knew it better than anybody else.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s get ready.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo also prepared an all-out war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ begins in that area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Death Response’ begins in that area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Shadow Legion’ will gather up in that area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As always, everything started with black smoke erupting from behind him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The undead legion walked out of it and lined up behind Sungwoo. He could increase the undead army by double.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tsutsutsutsutsu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>The shadows cast on the floor wriggled immediately and raised themselves. Then, they filled the gaps between the undead, completing the Necromancer’s total power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Here’s one more thing.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo then prepared a new skill that he acquired a while ago.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Appointed Death Wizard<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Basic<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Consumption: 50 Mana<br/><br/><br/><br/>*When you raise a skeleton, this skill gives you ‘magical talent’ to make it a ‘skeleton mage’. (Maximum 5 skeleton mages)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Skeleton Mage can use several attack magic spells and curse type magic spells, and it will use more powerful magic when the skill is upgraded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Skeleton Mage can become a ‘Death Priest’ if it meets ‘specific conditions’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Skeleton Mage can become ‘Lich’ if it satisfies ‘specific conditions’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a skill that would supplement the subordinate spirits of the ‘wizard’ series,” which Sungwoon didn’t have until now. Based on this, Sungwoo was going to diversify his tactics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately used the skill on one Werewolf skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have appointed him as the ‘Death Wizard’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Because the target’s intellect is weak, the skill of ‘basic grade’ is given. (The possibility of upgrading is slim.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a green light coming from the Werewolf skeleton’s grasp. He could use magic in an instant. However, one of the system messages was somewhat annoying to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘·Intellect? The possibility of upgrading it is dim?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The fact that the skeleton could use magic alone was encouraging, but Sungwoo could not make light of the skeleton’s low intellect.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The power of magic is particularly different, depending on the level of the user’s intellect. If intellect affects the level of magic…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Sungwoo appointed Minsok, who was standing next to him, as a “Death Wizard” this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have appointed him as the ‘Death Wizard’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Due to the superior intellect of the target, a ‘professional level’ skill is given. (There is a very high possibility of upgrading.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, a much higher grade skill was given to Minsok, unlike the Werewolf skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Suddenly, I have multiple magic skills, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok looked down at his hand and looked embarrassed. He was a knight-type profession, but he suddenly obtained several magic powers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But that wasn’t all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-New skills are given in connection with the target’s existing profession card (Death Knight).<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Black Magic Sword<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Professional<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Passive<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Consumption: None<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Inject mana into a weapon to ‘enhance’ it. (+110%) Also inflicts a ‘confusion’ curse on the attacked enemy. Each time the skill is upgraded, the ‘enhancement effect’ increases dramatically.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The addition of the wizard job group to his knight job group enabled Minsok to be a ‘magic swordsman.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I just got another good one!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I know this is the first time you are using magic, so use it by learning it well.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok lifted his shield and sword, showing his confidence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay. I know how to because I studied hard when I attended school.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and Minsok were ready for the battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two grabbed their weapons and looked up at the ceiling. Dr. Yu was also looking down at them from inside the capsule.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But neither of them moved first. It was like a big battle. With both sides facing each other on a huge battlefield, they were waiting for the right time to attack because they knew the other was not easy prey. The moment one of them showed any weakness, the other party would seize the chance to attack and defeat them right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With both sides keeping silent, some wind that came from somewhere was blowing through the cavity. The wind was blowing among the bones of the skeletons, making an eerie sound.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shall we hit them first?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, for a moment….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, something unexpected took place out of nowhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A roaring sound was heard from the doorway sealed with divine magic behind Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dr. Yu also seemed embarrassed by the unexpected situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang! Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something was hitting the iron gate hard. The wall around the door shook in a small shock.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Had it not been sealed with divine magic, it would have been broken apart much earlier.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the door was torn out. With the LED lights in the hallway behind, a shadow walked out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, Jisu!” </div><h2 id="chapter246">Chapter 246</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            It was Jisu who was walking toward them. She looked around once and complained to Sungwoo in an annoyed voice, “I wish you had sent me a message if you were in a situation like this…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I thought you couldn’t come in because the door was locked.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since Sungwoo was blocked by the divine magic, Jisu broke it with her might as if it was not as strong as the chain that trapped Durahan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was an unexpected situation for Dr. Yu, but he did not lose his composure.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I see another good body here. Let me put you at the forefront of all the dolls over there!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, he moved first. The shooter puppets on the crane in the middle pulled their bowstrings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shish-shhhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Attack!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While arrows were raining down on him, Sungwoo lifted his bone shield and moved his army forward. Hundreds of troops advanced.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, some of them fire silver arrows! Be careful about them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was only one way for Jisu to nullify the silver arrows. She had to notice them and bounce them back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, let me pay close attention!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The giant monsters charged fiercely at Dr. Yu’s army with troll skeletons as the main force.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After narrowing their distance as much as possible, the trolls began to pull their slingshots.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tu-woong! Tu-woong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Heavy bullets were fired at the dolls controlled by Dr. Yu, but when the priests in the back folded their hands together, all the cranes were covered with protective shields.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Goong! Gugooooooooong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The slingshot bullets missed the targets.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! After all, the priests are the problem!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While striking back the arrows, Minsok used the new magic that he mastered. Black arrows were fired from his shield and thrown towards the priests. It was an attack that would lay a powerful curse when the target was hit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please hit them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the black arrows couldn’t even fly halfway across the distance before being blocked in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As Minsok complained, the 50 priests in the rear were too powerful. Their average level was high. Besides, since they, divided into several groups and took turns in casting spells one by one, Sungwoo’s allies could not seize the moment to counter-attack them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That wasn’t all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo! Watch out for the 2 o’clock direction!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The crane in the 2 o’clock position with the wizards on it moved quickly and bounced forward. Above the wizards’ heads, there was a “sand clock” sign. A whopping 20 of them were working together to prepare a massive magical attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two cranes made up of warriors were deployed around it, blocking the access of the Bone Wyverns. Eventually, their magic was completed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Avoid it!” Jisu shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quaguagua!<br/><br/><br/><br/>An enormous column of fire fell and swept over the ground once. Dozens of undead quickly turned into ashes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wizard crane slowly slipped back to the rear after its attack was completed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was as if Sungwoo’s allies were dealing with a giant Buddha statue with dozens of arms.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘We have no choice but to suffer their attack as things stand now.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Because the crane was floating at a fairly high above ground, Sungwoo’s troops on the ground could not cope with their attack efficiently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though ghouls and giant monkey skeletons climbed up the outer wall towards the crane, they fell helplessly whenever the fire magic was cast toward them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘We can’t even approach the crane.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Furthermore, the group of Bone Wyverns could not get close to the crane because of the intensive shooting of the snipers. Sometimes some of them managed to push into them a little more, but while they were tearing off the protective shields over the crane, they were beaten and fell helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were resurrected countless times, but they were faced with the same situation over and over again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I need something a little tougher.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo moved Bone Imoogi.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Googoogoo!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bone Imoogi had better defense power than Bone Wyverns, so if he raised his body and hit the crane, he could break through the shield before his body was smashed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘When the Bone Imoogi attacks the crane, let me use his body as a staircase, so I can send the ground troops up the crane.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s plan was feasible. If the shield over the crane was smashed, it would not be difficult for only a few undead to mount the crane and smash it easily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But there was another problem.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This time they’re attacking from the 11 o’clock position!” Jisu shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another wizard crane moved. It was large-scale freezing magic, and its target was Bone Imoogi. A blizzard was blowing toward his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bone Imoogi got frozen immediately and stopped moving. Subsequently, lightning magic was cast one after another, and Bone Imoogi, which lost its defense power, was shattered. Its fragments rained down on the undead army, causing secondary damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This guy is ahead of me in attacking strategy.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dr. Yu was grasping every situation while looking down from the ceiling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quaguaguagua!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Once again, massive flame magic was cast. As a result, more than half of the active undead were crushed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Their firepower is too strong! We can’t approach them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their attack was very organized and intense in terms of their firepower and defense power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If they kept attacking Sungwoo’s focus like this, one hour would quickly pass even without them counter-attacking properly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if he was completely confident, Dr. Yu lowered the crane to the ground, on which his warriors were hanging.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wheeeee―<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the warrior players with only upper bodies threw their spears. At the same time, the crane moved and swept past the undead army like a combine.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! They have to run out of mana! If we keep confronting them until they use up their mana, we can seize the moment to attack them, right?” Minsok said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he suggested a reasonable idea, Jisu found something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You can’t do it. They are supplied with mana potions through the hose!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Players’ brains and spines had all sorts of wires, one of which was a rubber tube. Whenever they ran out of mana, a mana potion was forcibly administered through the tube.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The thing was even before their mana potion ran out, Sungwoo’s skill cooldown would be back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu shouted, “Watch out for the silver arrows!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it was already too late. It was too far for her to strike them back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though it was a small-sized arrowhead, it split the head of a Bone Wyvern in half. His body was shattered to pieces and could never be resurrected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Without wasting silver arrows, Dr. Yu was killing Sungwoo’s army one by one, aiming for the decisive chance to attack him. As time went on, Sungwoo’s forces began to show their weakness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘We can’t defeat Dr. Yu’s forces with a full attack. Let me think about some other tactics.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stepped back and thought about the battlefield. He had no chance of winning if his army attacked them recklessly as they had done until now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘There is a key player who has been controlling all their movement.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their strategy relied on inducing their movement by delivering some electrical stimulus to those players, based on Dr. Yu’s instruction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That meant there was a connection device that linked Dr. Yu and the key players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If Dr. Yu is a brain surrounded by that solid divine magic, then there must be a heart, an engine that moves this weird mechanical device.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The innermost wall came into his eyes while Sungwoo was looking around carefully. There was something like an exhaust vent, which periodically emitted black smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The engine in question was most likely there behind the wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What if I can turn off the engine?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>All mechanical devices would stop automatically.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo sent his subordinate spirit Specters there. They broke through the wall and allowed Sungwoo to see beyond the wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘As expected it’s the engine room.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Six mechanical devices were running in six separate rooms. They were the power source that moved the cranes and the players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘How can I break them?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wall between the cavity and the engine room was too thick. Even if Sungwoo sent the Evil Spirit Bomb, he could not destroy the wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, there was no light in the engine room, but there were six exhaust vents emitting black smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘But we can’t go in there.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each of the vents was so small. An adult male could never pass through any of them. It was designed like that for safety.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Maybe a child can get through it…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While muttering like that, Sungwoo looked down on the side all of a sudden.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Most of Sungwoo’s subordinate spirits were huge, but there was only one that was very small.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! It was good I saved you for this occasion!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The time had come for the goblin skeleton of the undead army to play a decisive role. </div><h2 id="chapter247">Chapter 247</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Dr. Yu controlled the battlefield by looking down on the cavity from his safety capsule on the ceiling, and everything was unfolding as he intended.<br/><br/>“Okay, it’s not as difficult as I thought.”<br/><br/>The Necromancer came up with several options to overcome the difficult situation facing him, but Dr. Yu grasped his intentions before he could act.<br/><br/>It was thanks to his ability to respond quickly that he quickly froze the Bone Imoogi and smashed it by focusing his lightning magic on the giant snake.<br/><br/>“Necromancer, don’t you have any other option? So, this is going to be your last moment?”<br/><br/>At that moment, however, he noticed some suspicious movement. A huge black horse among the undead crowd started spurring the ground. It was one of his experimental subjects, ‘Durahan’.<br/><br/>“Oh, good. So, you seem to hit on a new idea, Necromancer!”<br/><br/>Dr. Yu watched Durahan’s movements to grasp the Necromancer’s intentions while scrutinizing other places at the same time.<br/><br/>“No, no. Necromancer, your real plan isn’t to use Durahan, right? I already know everything.”<br/><br/>In Dr. Yu’s eyes, Durahan was most likely a trick, for what he could do for now was nothing except gallop alone on the empty floor.<br/><br/>But Dr. Yu finally discovered something strange about Durahan.<br/><br/>“Did he have a head?”<br/><br/>Durahan, a knight without a head, had a pure white skull sitting on his shoulders, which didn’t fit him at all.<br/><br/>“Ah! Damn it!”<br/><br/>At that moment, Dr. Yu grasped the Necromancer’s next movement, but it was both unexpected and so extraordinary that he didn’t have time to respond.<br/><br/>Durahan wasn’t bait.<br/><br/>Du Du Du Du Du Du!<br/><br/>Durahan, who drove through the cavern towards the wall, picked up the “goblin skeleton” resting on his shoulders.<br/><br/>Hung!<br/><br/>Then, he flung the goblin skeleton toward the exhaust vent on the wall.<br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/>The goblin skeleton was thrown into the exhaust vent, and he got in.<br/><br/>The sound of him clashing deep inside the vent continued.<br/><br/>“No way!”<br/><br/>Dr. Yu checked the dashboard anxiously.<br/><br/>– Warning! Abnormal condition in ‘Engine-3’.<br/><br/>Soon, the third engine out of the six was turned off.<br/><br/>“Oh, no! You can’t!”<br/><br/>He even separated the engines into six rooms just in case the engine was attacked, but Engine-3, the most important engine among them, was attacked.<br/><br/>It was a coincidence for the Necromancer, but it was tremendously bad luck for Dr. Yu.<br/><br/>Ooh ooh ooh-<br/><br/>Soon, the two cranes connected to Engine-3 stopped. That was the crane on which Dr. Yu’s main force, the priests, hung.<br/><br/>At the same time, all the shields over the cranes disappeared. It was the moment when Dr. Yu’s forces were faced with a fatal weakness.<br/><br/>However, he had already been prepared for such a problem in advance.<br/><br/>“Alright. All I have to do is just hold out for only one minute until emergency power comes back on. Just one minute. If I can hold out only one minute…”<br/><br/>He made sure that if the main engine was turned off, he could draw electricity from the main facility. To save time, he pulled the unshielded crane to the rear.<br/><br/>-Facility power is switching to emergency power. (34%)<br/><br/>The resurrected “Bone Imoogi” began to erect his huge body.<br/><br/>“You can’t use the same trick again!”<br/><br/>Dr. Yu immediately moved the wizard crane and cast freezing magic towards the Bone Imoogi. His head got frozen in an instant. He would most likely be smashed again this time.<br/><br/>At that moment, Bone Imoogi stood upright in a diagonal line like a runway.<br/><br/>Something got on his back.<br/><br/>It was the black horseman, Durahan.<br/><br/>“No! Lightning strike! Smash him!”<br/><br/>The lightning magic flew toward the frozen Bone Imoogi. Again, it completely froze the body of Bone Imoogi.<br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/>But Durahan was faster. Like a fighter jet taking off from an aircraft carrier, Durahan sprang fiercely on the jumping board. The moment Durahan ran across Bone Imoogi’s nose, a ghost knight squad arose on his left and right.<br/><br/>“Oh, no!”<br/><br/>The eight-member violet knight squad soared tens of meters and climbed onto the crane behind its broken shields<br/><br/>Quaguaguagua!<br/><br/>During that moment when Dr. Yu was breathing out briefly, a crane was already tilting to one side, and 20 dolls fell helplessly.<br/><br/>The ghost knight squad flew towards another crane. Like a knight squad attacking the rear of the enemy line, they showed surprising destructive power at a tremendous speed.<br/><br/>Thump- Thump-<br/><br/>It was a disaster. The cranes, which used to be an impregnable fortress, began to collapse one by one like rotten branches.<br/><br/>Kiyiyeeeeeeee-<br/><br/>As the seams were broken and the rails smashed, roaring noises and sparks sprang up everywhere. The weapons soon turned into an ugly mass of scrap metal.<br/><br/>“Oh, no. Nonsense! This can’t happen!”<br/><br/>It was the biggest weakness of an army directed by one man that they would collapse at once as soon as they showed their fatal weakness.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was always conscious of that because he always dealt with the snipers aiming for his neck, but Dr. You had never experienced this kind of fight before.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>One minute was too long for Dr. Yu who had never experienced such a fight.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Durahan leaped forward according to Sungwoo’s will.<br/><br/>Bang! Quaguaguagua!<br/><br/>The ghost knight squad jumped and moved around the crane behind the broken shields. Then, running through the tilted cranes, they took away all of the 20 players from the crane.<br/><br/>When the wires and hoses connected to their brains and spines were cut off, their half bodies fell to the ground like fruit hit by a typhoon.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>Their bodies hit the ground and smashed to pieces.<br/><br/>-You have provided those who could not die with ‘a resting place.’ (112/240)<br/><br/>That was liberation.<br/><br/>-You have provided those who could not die with a ‘resting place.’ (121/240)<br/><br/>-You have provided those who could not die with a ‘resting place.’ (144/240)<br/><br/>A series of quest messages appeared.<br/><br/>“Tear out the rooftop capsule!”<br/><br/>The divine shield was turned off, so Dr. Yu was now defenseless.<br/><br/>Sungwoo moved the group of Bone Wyverns right away.<br/><br/>Quaddddddd!<br/><br/>They raised their tough claws and ripped the whole capsule out of the ceiling. They threw it down violently before Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/>Dr. Yu climbed out of the tattered safety capsule. He was already covered with blood.<br/><br/>“How can I collapse so helplessly like this…?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo came to his side then looked down at him cynically.<br/><br/>“If you were thinking of controlling the whole world by yourself, you should have thought about it a little more. You are finished!”<br/><br/>Dr. Yu looked up at him with bloodshot eyes and shouted, “What the hell are you talking about? You don’t know anything!”<br/><br/>With his bloody mouth open wide, he screamed, “Do you know how I prepared all this? When you guys didn’t know anything, I foretold the coming of this hellish situation!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo laughed it off and said, “So what? Even if you knew it, you didn’t do anything. What did you do?”<br/><br/>Upset by Sungwoo’s words, he sprang to his feet and started pointing at him.<br/><br/>“Damn it! I had a great plan ready. Yeah, I had a big plan!”<br/><br/>There was no more trace of an intellectual gentleman in Dr. Yu. Instead, a stubborn old man was staggering before Sungwoo. He charged at Sungwoo and thrust his fingers out as if he wanted to poke Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/>“I’ve failed because of you! If an ignorant guy like you had not disturbed me, I would have–”<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo cut off one of his arms.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhhh!”<br/><br/>Dr. Yu grabbed his cut area and bent down in pain.<br/><br/>Sungwoo sighed, putting the Grim Reaper on his shoulder, “You seduced the survivors by pretending to play the government role and held numerous human beasts here to experiment with them freely. Was that all you could do as a man who predicted the coming of this hellish situation?”<br/><br/>“Argh…”<br/><br/>“Because an insane guy like you is pretending to be the world’s best elite, humans have been suffering without doing anything.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo pushed the sickle into his neck.<br/><br/>“If you had known this could happen, you should have acted a little more responsibly, you useless junk!”<br/><br/>“Sense of responsibility? You need responsibility when you can be responsible for something. I didn’t feel any need to take responsibility for this damn human world. This world is finished anyway. What can I gain from it? Why is it important, you ignorant bastard?”<br/><br/>Dr. Yu would not give in. It seemed that he would not give up his wrong conviction until the moment he died.<br/><br/>“So, what did you find?”<br/><br/>“World Eater.”<br/><br/>‘World Eater?’ Sungwoo frowned at it. It was a strange word, but he had an ominous feeling.<br/><br/>“It is an absolute being that will lead us to transcend. They are watching us even at this moment…”<br/><br/>Having said that, he turned his head and started to stare at the ground in the middle of the cavity.<br/><br/>‘Something is looking at this place now?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo put his hand in his pocket.<br/><br/>-OFF AIR (-)<br/><br/>‘Is it at least different from the creator Imoogi mentioned?’<br/><br/>If that’s the case, “World Eater,” the unknown entity Dr. Yu has been serving, could also be just one element of the system.<br/><br/>“World Eater? What is that?”<br/><br/>“I swore to them that instead of being reborn as a transcendental being, I would give this earth to them. But I couldn’t keep that promise…” </div><h2 id="chapter248">Chapter 248</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Dr. Yu was still looking down on the floor. He looked very alert as if he discovered something underneath it.<br/><br/>“They will come here soon.”<br/><br/>“That’s why I asked you what it was.”<br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/>Just before Sungwoo finished asking, the ground around him vibrated. Everyone, including Sungwoo, stumbled.<br/><br/>Goo Goo Goo-<br/><br/>Soon, the entire cavern began to shake wildly. They could feel the vibration was slowly coming from a very deep place.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, it looks like something is coming up quite soon. It’s really big and very heavy.”<br/><br/>“I can feel it, too.”<br/><br/>A crack spread in the middle of the place that Dr. Yu was watching closely then it went down like a sinkhole. And black darkness soared from there.<br/><br/>Ooh ooh ooh-<br/><br/>Something like a black wave scattered in all directions and spread out like a huge screen.<br/><br/>The middle of the wide curtain popped out as if somebody pushed his hand in from behind. Something round appeared on top of the screen.<br/><br/>“Is it an eye?”<br/><br/>It was a huge eyeball. It slowly began to come out after pushing the darkness out of the veil. It was only an eyeball without any other part.<br/><br/>It tilted slowly from left to right and seemed to look around the entire cavern.<br/><br/>“What the hell…”<br/><br/>Without daring to move, Sungwoo and his allies looked at it with stiff postures and got ready for another battle.<br/><br/>At that moment, a message appeared.<br/><br/>-You are overwhelmed by the ‘external existence’.<br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-60%)<br/><br/>This message was the same as the one that Sungwoo saw when he opened the ‘Demon’s Door’ and witnessed the monsters creeping out of it.<br/><br/>‘Is it related to the Demon’s Door?’<br/><br/>But at that time, Sungwoo’s “deity status’ crushed the monster because his status was higher.<br/><br/>In other words, that eyeball was higher than Sungwoo’s deity status.<br/><br/>“World Eater!” Dr. Yu sighed and kneeled.<br/><br/>Blood gushed from his severed arm, but he didn’t even care about it.<br/><br/>He was overwhelmed by the huge eyeball in front of him.<br/><br/>“Please…”<br/><br/>World Eater looked at Dr. Yu. Its huge pupil slowly expanded.<br/><br/>“Oh, no!”<br/><br/>At the same time, Dr. Yu’s body began to be crushed.<br/><br/>Crunch- Crunch-<br/><br/>His skull was dented and his limbs were bizarrely bent.<br/><br/>His body began to compress in the air as if the force of gravity was working from all directions acting.<br/><br/>“Argh! Ahhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/>It was punishment for Dr. Yu’s breach of contract.<br/><br/>“Please! Don’t! Ugh!”<br/><br/>His flesh and bones were squashed, and blood spewed out. But soon even that blood began to condense into a single point. It kept folding inward to the physically impossible point.<br/><br/>After all, Dr. Yu’s body turned into a small piece of flesh and fell to the floor.<br/><br/>That was it.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Looking at that brutal scene, Sungwoo and his party realized they could not dare to deal with that huge eyeball.<br/><br/>It lifted its pupil and looked at them again. Its iris moved to diminish its pupil. Now, it fixated on Sungwoo.<br/><br/>-The ‘unknown being’ is staring at you.<br/><br/>The eyeball made no sound, just looking at him quietly.<br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t know the feeling of the ‘unknown being’ because it had no other facial parts or even the eyelids.<br/><br/>-You have incurred the anger of the ‘unknown being’.<br/><br/>It was clear that the huge eyeball hated Sungwoo terribly.<br/><br/>The hatred of the unknown being was familiar to Sungwoo because all the absolute beings in this game hated Sungwoo without exception.<br/><br/>‘But this guy is dangerous. If it could use that power to kill me, just like Dr. Yu, how can I stop it?’<br/><br/>Just staring at Dr. Yu without touching a hand killed him instantly. Sungwoo didn’t know how it was possible, so he couldn’t figure out how to stop it.<br/><br/>‘I just hope this guy can use it only for those who have a contract with him.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo prepared to mobilize all the undead right away. He didn’t think he could beat such an overwhelming creature. He had to find a way to escape by mobilizing them to block its attack.<br/><br/>At that moment, the creature moved its pupil from Sungwoo to some other place. It seemed as if its murderous look was being softened.<br/><br/>-The ‘unknown being’ has pledged that it will take your life someday.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the unknown being seemed to think it was not the right time to attack Sungwoo. The huge eyeball began to disappear into the black veil.<br/><br/>Soon, even the black curtain scattered away like smoke. Sungwoo and his party could not move for a while, standing in their place.<br/><br/>“What was that monster a moment ago?” asked Jisu, putting the sword back in the sheath, with a relaxed expression.<br/><br/>“I think I’ll face that creature next time. I’ll ask then.”<br/><br/>Then, he looked around. It seemed there was nothing threatening around.<br/><br/>A message about the end of this battle appeared at that moment.<br/><br/>-You have successfully cleared the exclusive quest ‘Provide Death to Those Who Can’t Die’.<br/><br/>* Reward is given. (Exclusive Skill)<br/><br/>* Your fate has changed subtly.<br/><br/>Finally, the quest was completed. And an exclusive skill was given to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>-You have acquired the skill .<br/><br/>-Skill grade has been improved. (Professional → Craftsman)<br/><br/>“Again?”<br/><br/>This was the fourth time he acquired such a skill.<br/><br/>As a result, Death Response reached the level of “craftsmanship.”<br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/>-Name: Death Response<br/><br/>-Class: Craftsman<br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/>-Cost: 130 Mana<br/><br/>*You can summon and control 50 masterless zombies amid the Abyss. This object is not limited by the number of your subordinate spirits but will disappear as dust after 40 minutes. (Cooldown: 25 minutes)<br/><br/>As the grade changed from “specialist” to “craftsman”, the number of zombies that Sungwoo could summon increased from 25 to a whopping 50.<br/><br/>He wasn’t sure of its full capacity because he hadn’t seen a skill above the ‘specialist’ level yet, but given the double increase, it reached the maximum level.<br/><br/>‘If I apply Shadow Corps here, I can summon 100 zombies.’<br/><br/>As the level of his skill increased, the size of his army was increasing exponentially.<br/><br/>With this trend going on, Sungwoo would be able to control several thousand one day.<br/><br/>If so, could he put an end to the game itself, not to mention the “World Eater” he encountered a little while ago?<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not answer now, but he could not stop rooting out the source of this whole game.<br/><br/>“By the way, the Evolution Society is finished, right?” asked Jisu, letting out a sigh.<br/><br/>Like she said, Sungwoo ended one of the really bad entities that had been chasing them for a long time. But this time he encountered another bad guy, namely the World Eater.<br/><br/>There were still so many bad guys including the World Eater that he had to annihilate.<br/><br/>And he needed to do something now.<br/><br/>“It’s finished. But work starts now.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, we’re done with the Evolution Society. But it’s just the start.”<br/><br/>“Pardon? What are you talking about?”<br/><br/>“We have to collect all the stuff in this building.”<br/><br/>Originally, it was natural that the winner would take the booty, but Sungwoo had too much this time.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The legacy left behind by the Evolution Society was enormous. Of course, looking into their facilities,Sungwoo and his party could find traces of their heinous activities. But except for them, all the rest could be called a great treasure.<br/><br/>For example, the necessities stored in a single warehouse among the huge facilities were numerous enough to help the players in the Suwon village sustain for several months.<br/><br/>Since the Evolution Society itself was a group that mainly focused on research and development, it seemed that it would serve as something like a tremendous source of nutrients for the village players who were rapidly developing as there were all kinds of materials and items in the area of living and production.<br/><br/>“I contacted them. Hanho and Inho will arrive here soon.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Jisu alone could not tour the entire facility, nor could they deal with the prisoners held by the Evolution Society. As a result, Sungwoo needed a huge staff to take care of them.<br/><br/>After a while, four helicopters arrived. They flew from Suwon.<br/><br/>Hanho jumped first and shouted, “Wow! Finally, they surrendered! Man, I should have shown my great skills right in front of them!”<br/><br/>Unlike Hanho, who was a little excited, Inho was full of anxiety.<br/><br/>After looking through the facility, Inho sighed, “I saw the facility from the helicopter. It’s very large. I’ve brought 55 men here, but it looks like they are not enough. Well, it will take at least a few weeks because your undead can’t continue to help us. Of course, this is my opinion.”<br/><br/>This was the moment that the small number of elites was a drawback, not a plus. In other words, there was an absolute shortage of manpower now. As a result, it would be a big loss in terms of saving time.<br/><br/>“I’ve got an idea.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo went to the white wolf that he had taken out of the prison. He was gathered with the human beasts who followed him.<br/><br/>As he approached, they showed fierce vigilance, but they gently stepped to the side without saying anything because they knew their survival depended on the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“Necromancer, what’s going on?”<br/><br/>“Well, I’m a guy with severe mood swings. I’ve one more condition for saving your lives.”<br/><br/>I have ups and downs, so instead of saving you, one more condition has been attached.”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>The white wolf hardened his face.<br/><br/>Sungwoo said, “You guys know that when you move out of your original place, you have to clean it up, right?”<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo mobilized the human beasts for that huge job for free. </div><h2 id="chapter249">Chapter 249</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">

                            After hearing about the current status of the world tree, Sungwoo decided to go back to Suwon.<br/><br/>“Inho, please take care of the situation here. I know you have to care about lots of stuff, but you guys are going to be of great help to us.”<br/><br/>“Sure, don’t worry. Let me scrutinize this place and get rid of any remaining monsters.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo decided to let Inho take control over the Evolution Society headquarters and left Jisu behind as a contingency.<br/><br/>Even now there was a possibility that some dangerous test specimens peculiar to the Evolution Society could pop out. So, at least one strong man needed to stay here to prepare for it.<br/><br/>“Well, I think I have to leave here as soon as I have arrived here. Why did I come?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo decided to take Hanho with him this time. He needed to be with either Hanho or Jisu because he didn’t know what the growth of the world tree would bring about.<br/><br/>No matter how reliable the villagers were, they were not as trustworthy as the two in Sungwoo’s mind.<br/><br/>“Why did you come here? Hey, you feel comfortable riding on a helicopter, right? Since I gave it to you instead of the Bone Wyvern you felt uncomfortable about, you have to use it often,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Man, you are so mean. I wonder how long you can be so mean to me like that…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo got on the helicopter with Hanho.<br/><br/>On the way back to Suwon, Sungwoo received a message that the ‘2nd Korean-Japanese War’ was over.<br/><br/>-The Korean server has won the final victory in ‘The 2nd Korean-Japanese Battle: Bloody War of Revenge’!<br/><br/>* Rewards are given to each player, depending on their contribution to the Korean server’s victory.<br/><br/>This victory was possible because Kangsok Han suddenly appeared and beat the Kyushu United Army in Tsushima while Sungwoo and his allies headed to Daejon to annihilate the Evolution Society.<br/><br/>‘Is it okay for me to share his credit?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought about it for a moment because he was given the rewards for free this time. It was natural that he felt a bit uncomfortable.<br/><br/>-The rewards for the ‘2nd Korean-Japanese War: Bloody War of Revenge’ are given.<br/><br/>* Contribution: 2nd place<br/><br/>* Reward: 45,000,000 gold<br/><br/>* Additional reward: ‘War Hero’ title.<br/><br/>-The title of ‘War Hero’ is replaced with the title of ‘War Hero (Level 2)’.<br/><br/>* All stats increase (+3)<br/><br/>Since the Evolution Society was also ruled as a “hostile force,” Sungwoo received the reward for his considerable contribution, but he was only 2nd place this time.<br/><br/>However, he wasn’t disappointed at the rewards because he could see the positive side, too.<br/><br/>‘Well, I can now pay attention to other places instead of going on an expedition to Japan. Japan isn’t the last force that I will have to defeat in the days ahead.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought of devoting the time he saved to developing the World Camp further.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, the chat window is very frantic with people gossiping about the victory in Japan. Do you want to check it?”<br/><br/>The chat window on the official channel was still boisterous because the final results of the Koran-Japanese War were so shocking.<br/><br/>[Real time chat]<br/><br/>― Dinossauro22 (POR): There is something we forget. Thousands of Japanese players were killed in just one day. And they were killed by only two men!<br/><br/>― Gold5551 (GHA): I’ve been watching the fight all along. But only two men played a decisive role. I still can’t believe it. What happened?<br/><br/>― OMGplz (USA-1): 7,000 vs 2 Wow, so cool!<br/><br/>― Ngưỡng mộ (VIE): The Korean server had a worldview of the dragon ball. Why does such a strong player, strong enough to destroy the planet, keep appearing?<br/><br/>― This is the country of Necromancer (KOR): Lol. Why is the Japanese server keeping silent? Where are they?<br/><br/>― BIGchicken (AUS): I don’t think Japan will target Korea in the future. They were defeated so big this time.<br/><br/>―Ezezez (USA-1): I forgot. These guys are geniuses, the Koren players! The world is collapsing, but it’s a game in the end! Oh, My God. They will conquer the world, I believe.<br/><br/>― Amigo41 (BRA): What does Korea have to do with the game? Can they excel beyond others just because of the game system? How can Japan, the country of martial arts, Japan, collapse so easily?<br/><br/>― GUNGUNBANG (USA-2): I can’t even understand, but I think I can obey. I just hope he isn’t like Hitler.<br/><br/>Although the battle ended several hours ago, the chat window on the official channel was still flooded with their outbursts of admiration. Since the performance of the Korean server players was so overwhelming, it was natural that those watching their fighting were still reveling in the afterglows of the victory.<br/><br/>– The ‘event broadcasting’ of the official channel is expected to end soon. (00:04:59)<br/><br/>Since the Korean-Japanese war event ended, there was no reason to air the broadcast anymore. Accordingly, the first exchanges among countries through the broadcast were cut off.<br/><br/>However, as the viewers scattered to the community of their server and spread the shocking news, the Korean-Japanese War event was becoming a hot issue everywhere.<br/><br/>In the meantime, those giant forces of each foreign server, who were planning to clear the world quest were forced to reconsider their expedition on the Korean peninsula.<br/><br/>To put it simply, they got cold feet because of the Korean server’s spectacular performance.<br/><br/>After watching 6,000 Japanese troops get killed, they realized that they should not even try to touch the Korean server with ordinary forces for now. That meant they would organize a large expedition later.<br/><br/>‘We’ll face a bigger war.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought that he should prepare for such a war. So, he had to make the Suwon village a key strategic base in the upcoming war.<br/><br/>“We will be arriving in town soon!”<br/><br/>The pilot’s voice was heard through the headset.<br/><br/>Then, he gave them a briefing.<br/><br/>“The world tree grew so high that we had to move the helicopter landing area in the square. So, let me land on a nearby landing place!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked out the window. Hwaseong Palace began to come into his view. He saw a huge tree standing tall in the middle of it. As he already heard, it was as high as a 20-story apartment building.<br/><br/>‘Man, it looks much taller than an apartment building!’<br/><br/>Although it was as tall as a building, its branches that stretched out to the sky were overwhelmingly long and heavy.<br/><br/>Its huge greenery covered all the buildings in the area just like a huge umbrella.<br/><br/>“It’s crazy! It wasn’t that tall a little while ago. It looks like a mountain when I look down on it from here!”<br/><br/>Like Hanho exclaimed, the world tree looked like a mountain thick with trees and bushes.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>After getting off the helicopter at the simple landing site, Sungwoo went to the world tree with Kyongsu who greeted him.<br/><br/>Suddenly, not only the plaza but also the entire shopping district was under the shadow of the world tree.<br/><br/>Sunlight penetrated through the branches of the tree, creating a mysterious atmosphere.<br/><br/>‘How come it has changed like this overnight?’<br/><br/>He felt like he was inside a huge dome stadium. The lighting seeping through the branches reminded him of the lights hanging from the ceiling of the stadium.<br/><br/>A group of mountain birds flew up from the center of the branches. They flew for a while and finally reached the end of the branches. The world tree was the whole world for them.<br/><br/>“I don’t know how big it will grow in the future, but I think we have to make a city plan with the world tree in mind.”<br/><br/>“What’s the problem?”<br/><br/>“Well, the roots of that monster tree have already filled the square, so we never know when they will affect the surrounding buildings. The roots are so strong that they will push away everything around, be they concrete or reinforced steel.”<br/><br/>Kyongsu seemed to be worried about the rapid growth of the world tree. As he said, it grew so fast and tall. So much so that someday it could push out all the nearby facilities.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, all the main facilities of the World Tree camp were concentrated near the square.<br/><br/>“Didn’t the area of the invisible barrier expand thanks to the growth of the world tree?”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo asked, Kyongsu said, “Well, I measured it. It extended to about three kilometers from the world tree. I could not confirm it with my eyes, but it seemed the barrier was thicker than before.”<br/><br/>“Well, if that’s the case, we have to think about developing the area inside the invisible barrier as well as the plaza as much as possible.”<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>This time, Busan was attacked by the Japanese server, but Suwon, the main base of the World Tree camp, would be a target one day. So, they had to hasten to fortify it as soon as possible.<br/><br/>“By the way, after Kangsok Han swept Tsushima, he left behind the Japanese military items. So, I contacted the Hwarang Guild to collect the items.”<br/><br/>Kangsok said on the air he would leave behind the war booty, so Sungwoo would gladly accept them.<br/><br/>However, when the quest was over, Sungwoo could not use the teleport skill, so he could not go there in person. So, he decided to use the “Hwarang Guild” that he had helped before.<br/><br/>“Since we have decided to share the loot with the Hwarang Guild, I think we have to dispatch some of our members to Busan to transport the items.”<br/><br/>If the loot from Busan, the loot from the Evolution Society, and the loot from Tsushima Island were added, they would provide a tremendous source of growth for the Suwon village.<br/><br/>However, Kyongsu made a gloomy expression for some reason. </div><h2 id="chapter251">Chapter 251</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “Well, we are so short-handed right now. Moreover, half of our staff went down to Daejon…”<br/><br/>The problem was the shortage of men.<br/><br/>“Don’t worry.”<br/><br/>Since Sungwoo was also aware of the problem, he took some measures in advance.<br/><br/>“I have contacted a reliable reinforcement force. Please be ready to send all the helicopters to near Lake Sihwa one hour later.”<br/><br/>“Paron? Lake Sihwa?”<br/><br/>“Players from Kanghwa Island will join us here. They will take boats to Lake Sihwa, and after that, we will meet them.”<br/><br/>On Kanghwa Island, there was a group of 256 players led by Muyon.<br/><br/>Since they were helped by Sungwoo, they have consistently supported the Necromancer. They finally decided to join the players in the Suwon village.<br/><br/>“Wow! That’s great. If they arrive, they will be of great help.”<br/><br/>When he heard such good news from Sungwoo, Kyongsu’s expression turned bright. He had been suffering the shortages of men, but he could feel relaxed now.<br/><br/>He continued, “Our villagers will welcome the Kanghwa Island players without any reservation because we often inquired after each other in the community.”<br/><br/>Although the players from the two areas had never met before, they already formed a sense of comradeship because they rallied around the Necromancer as the members of the Third camp.<br/><br/>Therefore, the players of Kanghwa Island were reliable enough to make them not worry about the problems they encountered when they were accepting new members.<br/><br/>“Good. Please provide the living space for the players of Kanghwa Island.”<br/><br/>“We have already set up lodgings nearby. We can accept at least one thousand more.”<br/><br/>As expected, Kyongsu already planned things like that to develop the Suwon village further.<br/><br/>“Okay, Kyongsu. I trust you.”<br/><br/>“Oh, by the way, the world tree has borne fruit. Are you going to check it right now?”<br/><br/>“Yeah. Please tell me the location.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo followed Kyongsu to approach the world tree.<br/><br/>The closer he approached, the higher he had to raise his head. In the past, it was surprisingly high, but this time he was almost overwhelmed by its growth.<br/><br/>“Well, it’s pretty difficult to approach that monster tree.”<br/><br/>The square, which had been flat, was rugged with roots rising from the ground, so they could not head to the world tree right away.<br/><br/>Some roots protruded up from the ground, almost blocking the way like a fence.<br/><br/>So, the two had to go around the place to reach the trunk of the world tree.<br/><br/>“Whew! We’re finally here. If you look up there, there are three fruits.”<br/><br/>As soon as Kyongsu said that, a message appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/>-‘Owner of the World Tree’ can select one of the following tribe traits. Depending on the propensity of the owner, the ‘detailed traits’ of each tribe may change.<br/><br/>* You can select by checking the fruit.<br/><br/>‘Fruit?’<br/><br/>When they approached the world tree, a new message appeared, but it seemed that the new fruits were related to the selection of the tribe.<br/><br/>‘Then, the fact that the fourth option has not been found yet means that no fruit has been born yet.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought this could be a surprisingly easy puzzle.<br/><br/>“Kyungsoo, are there only three fruits?”<br/><br/>“Probably. After checking that the tree bore fruits, I also checked all the branches for any other fruit, but I found none.”<br/><br/>“Well, let’s double-check just in case. We don’t need many people. Can you bring some here?”<br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/>In the meantime, Seongwoo flew near the fruits on a zombie bird. All three fruits were hung near the thick branches right above the stem, so he could easily confirm them.<br/><br/>Sungwoo reached out for the platinum-colored fruit among them. Since he had no intention of picking it, he just put his fingers lightly on the surface.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Second Fruit of the World Tree (Fruit of the Fairy)<br/><br/>-Grade: Myth<br/><br/>-Category: consumption<br/><br/>-Effect: Unknown<br/><br/>-Description: A fruit containing the mysterious power of the world tree. When you eat it, you will undergo a special change. (However, you will not be able to eat other fruits.)<br/><br/>There was no specific information about the fruit, but by looking at its name, Sungwoo realized this fruit was the key to choosing a tribe.<br/><br/>The remaining green and brown fruits were also the fruits of Tree Spirits and Giants, respectively.<br/><br/>‘The problem is the fourth fruit that has not yet been discovered.’<br/><br/>Ten players were mobilized to find the fourth fruit. They wore safety gear and climbed up the world tree.<br/><br/>“Be careful, everyone! If you fall, you will die immediately!”<br/><br/>“If I die, bury me under the world tree!”<br/><br/>The leaves were so lush they couldn’t find the fruit with the naked eye. Going directly through the branches was the best way to search for the fourth fruit, but they could not find the fourth fruit anywhere.<br/><br/>“We can’t find it! We have even crawled through the branches and checked them all, but there is nothing like a fruit anywhere. Hey! Did you find anything there?”<br/><br/>“Nope! Could it be that the birds picked it?”<br/><br/>“Uh? The fruit of the world tree? Is it possible our security is so loose?”<br/><br/>“No way!”<br/><br/>In the end, the ten players who came out to search for the fruit had to go back empty-handed.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Sungwoo was lost in thought, sitting alone on one of the roots where he could look up the world tree.<br/><br/>‘I have to find it by all means.’<br/><br/>He had no intention of choosing the option within the given conditions without finding the fourth fruit. Since he always made an unusual choice, he could achieve faster growth than others.<br/><br/>The third camp, namely, the World Tree camp, was also born through such a choice. Again, he needed to select something outside the given options.<br/><br/>‘The message that it was not found yet clearly means that the tree has borne the fruit. But we can’t find it anywhere…’<br/><br/>How long did he ponder over it? He suddenly looked at the roots rising above the surface of the square.<br/><br/>“Wait a minute…”<br/><br/>He then stood up from his seat and looked at the roots near him.<br/><br/>Then, he muttered, “Well, there is no law that the tree bears fruit only on its branches, right?”<br/><br/>The existence of the “world tree” was beyond human understanding.<br/><br/>So, he thought it might be too narrow-minded to believe that the fruits would be born only on the branches of the world tree.<br/><br/>He immediately summoned two Specters.<br/><br/>“Examine everything under the roots.”<br/><br/>Two Specters crept into the ground. Sungwoo shared their view with him.<br/><br/>The underground was already ravaged by the roots of the world tree. Its strong and thick vitality pushed out the hard stratum and underground facilities and occupied a huge area underground.<br/><br/>When they went underground to some extent, there was a series of spaces between the roots through which people could come and go. It looked like a passage made intentionally. With a little renovation, it could serve as an underground space.<br/><br/>And a spacious room emerged at the center of the space, namely at the point where the thick roots united.<br/><br/>‘I’ve found it.’<br/><br/>There was a round object hanging right there. As Sungwoo expected, the fourth fruit was growing from the root underground.<br/><br/>Sungwoo confirmed the information of the fruit through Specter.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: The second fruit of the world tree (unknown fruit)<br/><br/>-Grade: Myth<br/><br/>-Category: consumption<br/><br/>-Effect: Unknown<br/><br/>-Description: It is still not fully ripe. It’s somewhere empty and unstable. If this fruit grows like this, it will be a worthless one. However, it is possible to determine the future of the fruit by “imprinting” a “special power” into it. Depending on the magnitude of the force, the effect of the fruit will also vary.<br/><br/>Since it was hidden, the fruit was a completely different item from the other three.<br/><br/>Looking at the description, Sungwoo could not use it right away.<br/><br/>Although he succeeded in finding the fourth fruit, that was not all. He had to solve additional puzzles.<br/><br/>‘Imprinting? Does it mean that this fruit doesn’t belong to any specific tribe, so I can choose one?’<br/><br/>It was a kind of “blank check” in that respect.<br/><br/>“In that case, it is important what value to enter on this blank paper. If this is the case, another quest?”<br/><br/>A message rang as soon as he said that.<br/><br/>-You have satisfied the conditions for progressing the ‘Myth Quest’ by meeting certain conditions (Possession of an ‘unidentified egg’).<br/><br/>[Myth Quest]<br/><br/>-Name: Origin of the race (Dragon race)<br/><br/>-Type: Unknown<br/><br/>-Goal: Find ‘the clue to evolution’<br/><br/>-Reward: Evolve into a new race<br/><br/>* You have obtained two “absolute seeds.” One is the growing and powerful race itself, and the other is the vessel of life that can contain transcendental power.<br/><br/>If the two seeds are fused under destiny conditions, you will create a new myth.<br/><br/>* When an unknown egg ‘hatches’ and the world tree reaches the ‘completed’ stage, the ‘evolution clue’ will be revealed. (If either seed is damaged, you will fail.)<br/><br/>“Dragon race?”<br/><br/>It was more terrific than he imagined. </div><h2 id="chapter252">Chapter 252</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            ‘It means a human who has inherited the blood of a dragon.’<br/><br/>In other words, if the human beasts such as Werewolf and Werebear could acquire the appearance and physical abilities of the wolf and bear, respectively, then the dragon race could exert the power of dragons.<br/><br/>‘Wyverns were the dominant ruler of the Korean server. Dragon? I’ve never seen this race before.’<br/><br/>However, the name of the dragon was enough to explain everything. It was often said that the status of the dragon in fantasy was the most powerful like the final boss level.<br/><br/>Sungwoo checked the credential qualification time for the “ownerless sword” carried by Minsok.<br/><br/>-Time remaining until credentials: 1,001 days<br/><br/>Now, after the remaining days are over, the ‘unidentified egg’ will hatch. It started 5,000 days ago, so Sungwoo shortened the required time much faster than he thought.<br/><br/>‘At this rate, it will hatch soon.’<br/><br/>Based on the recent boss monsters he confronted, he thought he could complete the time requirements by hunting two more boss monsters.<br/><br/>“I don’t have to rush. I’ll fulfill the time while I’m doing what I have to do.’<br/><br/>He knew that he could lose everything if he rushed.<br/><br/>So, Sungwoo decided to take care of what he was faced with right now.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>That night, the players of Kanghwa Island arrived with the cry of a griffin.<br/><br/>“Necromancer! It’s been a while!”<br/><br/>Heyon on the griffin landed finally. She couldn’t take her eyes off the world tree from the sky.<br/><br/>“Wow! This tree is so big!”<br/><br/>Then, three helicopters landed in a makeshift field. Some of the 256 players of Kanghwa Island arrived first.<br/><br/>When they heard their arrival, all the villagers came out and greeted them.<br/><br/>“Wow! Welcome!”<br/><br/>“Welcome, everybody! We’re being reunited like this!”<br/><br/>Both sides exchanged greetings in a friendly manner. They had been looking forward to meeting for a long time, and the time finally came.<br/><br/>“Let’s work together well!”<br/><br/>“Of course!”<br/><br/>Then, Kyongsu stepped forward and escorted them to their lodging.<br/><br/>“Okay, everyone. Please unpack your baggage first. The building you see over there is your lodging. It is very spacious and clean. Please feel free to talk to me if you have any inconveniences.”<br/><br/>The villagers renovated several stores in front of the museum into lodging for the Kanghwa players.<br/><br/>They were divided into family groups before choosing one per family. Since they were assigned to each room according to the number of people, all the rooms were distributed fairly.<br/><br/>“Wow! Each room has a bed! I also see tableware and towels ready.”<br/><br/>“There is also a barbecue grill on the roof.”<br/><br/>They could not help but be deeply moved by the villagers’ considerate attention to their welfare during their stay here.<br/><br/>“Man, they have even connected the battery items! I can feel how much they care about us.”<br/><br/>“You bet. They said they were busy because they were short-handed, but I can feel how much they care about us by providing us with this kind of good accommodation.”<br/><br/>After unpacking, they looked around the facilities in the village, checking the village terrain, and exchanged greetings with the village players.<br/><br/>“Uh, Hanho? It’s been a while!”<br/><br/>“Hello! Isn’t our village so cool?”<br/><br/>“It’s the best!”<br/><br/>“Now this has become our village!”<br/><br/>Since Hanho already met some of the village players several times, he greeted them gladly like friends.<br/><br/>“You are my brother, the Strongest Thief, right?”<br/><br/>At that moment, somebody called him from behind. A little boy who looked like an elementary school student came running to him. He was Heyon’s stepbrother, Youngin.<br/><br/>“Oh, it’s you!<br/><br/>“Yeah! I’m now a level 6 player!”<br/><br/>He boasted of his level first. He was far below average level, but considering his age as an elementary school student, he was growing steadily.<br/><br/>“Really? You must be the highest level among your friends.”<br/><br/>“Yeah! I’m the strongest among my peers. Brother, you have reached level 20, right? You are cool!”<br/><br/>Although some of the top rankers were killed during the Korean-Japanese War, Hanho was ranked quite high.<br/><br/>“Uh? Did you check out my ranking, too? Hahaha!”<br/><br/>“Someday I’m going to reach as high a level as you, brother. By all means!”<br/><br/>“As things stand now, you can!”<br/><br/>Anyway, they were getting along well like this from the beginning.<br/><br/>However, they could not afford to stay complacent forever.<br/><br/>Around 10 pm, Kyongsu’s voice came out through the speakers in the square.<br/><br/>“Today is the first day we have met, so I would like to have a small party for you, but starting at dawn tomorrow, you have to transport a large number of people. So, please go to bed early tonight.”<br/><br/>Tomorrow, 40 people were scheduled to head to Busan to transport the war booty from Tsushima Island, while 50 people would head to the main site of the Evolution Society in Daejon to take care of the prisoners there.<br/><br/>In other words, they could not relax without any worries yet. The world quest aimed at the World Tree camp was still valid, so they didn’t know when they would be attacked again.<br/><br/>“Let’s go to bed early for tomorrow.”<br/><br/>“Sure! We have to save our stamina!”<br/><br/>The biggest reason they gathered here was to prepare for the upcoming war.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Sungwoo delivered a message about the prisoners of the Evolution Society to the Liberation Guild. The next morning they sent a reply to him.<br/><br/>Hanho read it.<br/><br/>“Uh, um… they say the terrain of a mine has appeared on Mt. Bukhan. Various ore items are found here, but because of their huge reserves, they are thinking of using the prisoners.”<br/><br/>“Sounds good.”<br/><br/>“They said they were still discussing the details, so they will contact you again next time. When I escaped from Yeongdungpo, I thought we would fight these guys, but I’m glad we can get along with them.”<br/><br/>Fortunately, there was a way to deal with a large number of prisoners. Just as herbal items grew in Mt. Paldal, special items could be gathered and mined in certain areas.<br/><br/>If they dispatched the prisoners to such areas, they could monitor and control the prisoners while utilizing them at the same time. It was like killing two birds with one stone.<br/><br/>‘If this happens, economic power will become important in the future.’<br/><br/>As each server entered a stable phase, giant forces with more capital than individuals could even dream of began to establish themselves.<br/><br/>‘If I stay complacent, relying on individual power, they could catch up with me anytime soon.<br/><br/>A little later several helicopters arrived.<br/><br/>“Supplies are coming in from Daejon! Please prepare to transport them!”<br/><br/>A huge number of supplies were brought in at once by a cargo plane stationed at the headquarters of the Evolutionary Society.<br/><br/>As soon as they arrived, they drove the forklifts on standby to the temporary landing field. Then, they began to transport the loot packed in wooden crates to the warehouse.<br/><br/>“What’s all this?”<br/><br/>“They are three boxes of 200 mid-sized battery chargers.’<br/><br/>“Okay, move them to Warehouse No. 1!”<br/><br/>A huge number of items began to pile up in the warehouse set up in advance.<br/><br/>Other items in the form of finished products, such as battery chargers and radios, as well as all kinds of material items were still overflowing after they filled ten warehouses.<br/><br/>The continuous processions of transporting goods was reminiscent of a distribution warehouse on a port.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this? Why is its packaging so complicated?”<br/><br/>“Look out! That’s the Breath of the Abyss!”<br/><br/>“What! Damn it! It was a close call!”<br/><br/>Several items needed special care because they were taken from the laboratory where all kinds of experiments were conducted. If anything went wrong, a major accident could occur.<br/><br/>“No matter what, you should make sure they don’t open this box. Got it?”<br/><br/>“Don’t open the box! Don’t check the contents of the box! Hey, there! Don’t open the box!”<br/><br/>Kyungsu and the staff of the General Affairs Department were busy going back and forth to relay Sungwoo’s order.<br/><br/>“I’m looking for another place to store things temporarily because the warehouses are full now. So, make sure they pile up the items well in front of the warehouse.”<br/><br/>“Okay!”<br/><br/>When Kyonhsu said that, the staff of the General Affairs Department communicated with each other through radio and spread his message.<br/><br/>“Okay, from now on, we’re going to temporarily stack things in front of Warehouse No. 10! Please follow my instruction!”<br/><br/>“Where? Warehouse No. 7 ?”<br/><br/>“No! Warehouse No. 10!”<br/><br/>They were in a hectic situation, but players in the life and manufacturing sector were watching their moving activities with satisfaction.<br/><br/>“Hey, did you see that? Looks like an ogre skull. Given the stigma on its forehead, so it’s Ogre Magi.”<br/><br/>“Where is it? It’s a jackpot! Awesome! Let’s make the bone helmets we made last time! This time, let’s properly enchant them properly and apply the magic damage amplification effect! I’m looking forward to it.”<br/><br/>The two blacksmiths chatted, checking the items in every warehouse. They were very much immersed in their job as blacksmiths. </div><h2 id="chapter253">Chapter 253</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            The blessing buffs improved when the world tree entered the ‘1st stage of maturity.’<br/><br/>-‘Abundance of Godly Tree (Second Stage)’ is given to the whole area.<br/><br/>* Item creation success rate increases. (+60%)<br/><br/>* Increases the probability of additional options when making items. (+20%)<br/><br/>* Item production cost is reduced. (+30%)<br/><br/>* Increases the probability of finding rare materials nearby. (+10%)<br/><br/>As a result, the two blacksmiths’ desire for production was soaring high. They took great delight in working because every time they attempted to make items, they succeeded, which, in turn, gave them great options.<br/><br/>“Bachelors!”<br/><br/>Mihee, Hanho’s mother, came in between the two blacksmiths.<br/><br/>“If you have any remaining bones, don’t take them all. Hand them over to me. I’ll make delicious beef bone soup for you.”<br/><br/>As a chef, she developed a variety of menus to take care of not only the health of the players but also give various buff effects.<br/><br/>“Oh, my God! Ogre bone soup? I don’t want it. To be honest, it’s so terrible.”<br/><br/>“Why not? It’s so savory. Because of the strength buffs, I feel stronger when I hammer the bones. You still don’t know how to enjoy the soup.”<br/><br/>“Really? Just go ahead and take my bone soup, too!”<br/><br/>The players showed their preferences for monster ingredients.<br/><br/>“Uh? How come you can complain about the food? You should count your blessings and stop complaining! You know what? What you ate last night was red oak head meat soup. Didn’t you put rice in it and ate it as if it was the most delicious thing?”<br/><br/>“What did you say? Oh, my…”<br/><br/>“Oops! I feel like vomiting…”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kanghwa Island players, who were assigned tasks, were busy getting accustomed to their new work.<br/><br/>There appeared some with extraordinary skills among them, contributing to the rapid development of the village. Muyon, the leader of the Kanghwa Island players, was one of them.<br/><br/>“Necromancer, I think my job can help fortify our village.”<br/><br/>“What kind of job is it?”<br/><br/>“It’s high-architect. It’s a four-star job in the field of architecture.”<br/><br/>An architect was a builder. However, the prefix ‘high’ was important because even if they were in the same field, the higher their grade, the more powerful skills they could gain.<br/><br/>If he had a four-star architecture job, he would certainly bring about significant change in the surroundings of the village.<br/><br/>“Well, can you build something like a fortress?”<br/><br/>“Yes. But until now, I have hardly ever used it because it requires a lot of gold.”<br/><br/>Having said that, Muyon handed him a piece of paper.<br/><br/>“After I came to this village, I designed it quickly last night. Would you like to take a look at it?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo took the paper.<br/><br/>-You have just contacted the ‘blueprint (a draft for the castle wall)’.<br/><br/>Then, as if he touched the prophetic stone, something like a video appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/>-You’re now watching a bird’s-eye view of the ‘castle wall blueprint’.<br/><br/>The scenery of the Suwon village centered around the world tree came into his view. A high wall surrounded the world tree and the village.<br/><br/>It was a bird’s-eye view, as described, and showed the building to be completed.<br/><br/>However, this was not just an image. Sungwoo could look into any part of the building he wanted and get detailed information about it.<br/><br/>[Class B castle wall (detailed information)]<br/><br/>-Height: 15m<br/><br/>-Width: 3m<br/><br/>-Material: general rock, magic mineral, etc.<br/><br/>-Effect: Magic Shield (5,000), Shooter Attack Power Increase (+10%)<br/><br/>-Cost: 30,000 gold per 3m² (excluding material cost)<br/><br/>When compared visually, it looked much taller and more solid than the nearby Suwon-Hwasung castle wall, not to mention its functionality in the actual war situation.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there were even “magic turrets” placed everywhere.<br/><br/>[B-Class Magic Turret (Details)]<br/><br/>-Height: 17m<br/><br/>-Width: 4m<br/><br/>-Material: mana stone, magic ore, fire core, etc.<br/><br/>-Effect: Magic Shield (6,000), Mage-type attack power increase (20%), Self-attack ability (4-fire flame turret)<br/><br/>-Cost: 250,000 gold per 1 house<br/><br/>When Sungwoo approached the area, the scenes of its use began to play automatically.<br/><br/>Ghaaaaaaaaa!<br/><br/>A group of 20 orcs began to approach the castle wall. Then, the muzzles on the turrets tilted and aimed at them.<br/><br/>Goo-woong!<br/><br/>They fired four flame spheres with an explosion, striking them.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>They were killed on the spot. With a heavy explosion, heat expanded and covered the surroundings. Twenty orcs were barbecued at once. The asphalt floor they had stood on boiled, giving off intense heat.<br/><br/>‘If they can make something like this, it would be a jackpot for us!’<br/><br/>They looked like weapons that could fire pretty powerful flames and freezing magic.<br/><br/>The village players had been preparing for the defense of the castle, but all they could do was block the holes between the buildings using the invisible barrier as the castle wall because they had no players with architect capabilities.<br/><br/>In this situation, if Muyon could build a castle wall with all kinds of buffs, it would be a real jackpot for the villagers.<br/><br/>“It’s the best. I think you will need it. Let’s go ahead.”<br/><br/>“Well, we have secured the construction material pretty much, but the estimated budget is 150 million gold. We need at least such a huge amount of gold to use the automatic construction command instead of manually stacking the bricks…”<br/><br/>“Do not worry. I have enough money.”<br/><br/>Currently, he had 599,884,855 gold. After winning the metropolitan war, he raked in a huge amount of gold through the betting pool, and he also garnered much more gold by winning a series of battles.<br/><br/>Moreover, the amount of gold stored in the “Vault of Oaths” exceeded 100 million gold.<br/><br/>He couldn’t immediately calculate the total of the World Tree camp’s assets with the addition of the war booty that would soon be delivered, so he could easily invest 150 million gold.<br/><br/>“Alright. Let me go over the details a little more and get back to you.”<br/><br/>“Okay. If there are more options you can add, don’t worry and just add them. Oh, you had better consult with Kyongsu, not me, about this matter.’<br/><br/>“Sure, will do.”<br/><br/>Kyongsu was well versed in the exact situation of the village. Since Sungwoo had several reliable men in the village including Kyongsu, all he had to do was review and approve their projects.<br/><br/>When they were in the thick of discussing the village matters, an unexpected helicopter appeared over the village.<br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo!<br/><br/>“Huh? Are there supplies they are supposed to deliver at this time?”<br/><br/>“No. They are supposed to arrive in 2 hours.”<br/><br/>“Then what is that helicopter?”<br/><br/>The mysterious helicopter landed at the makeshift field. Jisu exited it.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo!”<br/><br/>As soon as she got off, she called him. She should have been at the Evolution Society headquarters in Daejon now, so something urgent must have happened if she appeared unexpectedly like this.<br/><br/>“Jisu, what happened?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo came running to her, but he was rather dumbfounded to hear what she said.<br/><br/>“The King of the Great Mountain is looking for you, Sungwoo!”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain was the king of the monsters that ruled Mt. Taebaek as well as the master of a powerful force that drove away the Struggle Guild. He was also responsible for giving Jisu the Awakening Quest.<br/><br/>How could he look for Sungwoo? Was there a reason for it? He had nothing to do with Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“I had a way to get in touch with me, but he just got in touch with me. He said he wanted to ask you a favor, something very urgent.”<br/><br/>“What do you mean by something urgent? It has to be very urgent if you also know about it.”<br/><br/>Jisu nodded, catching her breath, and said, “Sungwoo, do you remember the prophetic stone you saw? I mean the first prophetic stone I got from the soldiers.”<br/><br/>To the best of his memory, the first prophetic stone foretold the so-called “Season 2 of Hell’s Coming”. And it was also an object that gave Sungwoo a chance to awaken.<br/><br/>“Of course, I know. It was about the birth of Lich on the first day of the New Year and covering the Korean peninsula with an army of undead. But I’ve already become Lich, so it won’t happen.”<br/><br/>“Well, that has already happened.”<br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not help but be dumbfounded.<br/><br/>“It looks like it occurred because of some hidden element. That is…”<br/><br/>She paused for a moment then opened her mouth again.<br/><br/>“I think it happened on the North Korean server, and it looks like they’re coming south.”<br/><br/>“You mean Lich has appeared on the North Korean server?”<br/><br/>“It’s not clear yet, but I think so.”<br/><br/>Jisu didn’t know what happened, but she thought she knew why the King of the Great Mountain needed the Necromancer. </div><h2 id="chapter254">Chapter 254</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            In Season 2 , Sungwoo vividly remembered the terrible scenes he saw through the prophetic stone which showed Lich on Bone Wyvern resurrecting the corpses piled up on Gwanghwamun Boulevard as an undead army.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo thought that would not happen after he took over the Grim Reaper and became Lich because he changed the future.<br/><br/>‘Did Lich appear on the North Korean server?’<br/><br/>Moreover, it’s still more than a month left until the first day of the New Year when the Season 2 update was scheduled.<br/><br/>‘As expected, things haven’t worked out as I intended.’<br/><br/>It has always been these kinds of variables that made this game great. Nobody was sure whether or not another Lich might be growing his strength somewhere.<br/><br/>‘If there is another Lich, I had better get rid of him, whether it is a player or a monster. For me, he is like a competitor who consumes the same resources.’<br/><br/>He could confirm it by recalling the ‘Awakening Quest’ in the past.<br/><br/>Recalling the description at the time, the message was about taking over the ‘Reaper’s Scythe’ first. In other words, there was only one item called Grim Reaper, and now, it was in Sungwoo’s possession.<br/><br/>Even if there was a player with a similar profession to Sungwoo somewhere, he couldn’t possess the Grim Reaper without killing Sungwoo.<br/><br/>‘What if there is another exclusive item…”<br/><br/>Conversely, it also meant that another competitor could preemptively obtain the item and adversely affect Sungwoo’s growth.<br/><br/>Therefore, Sungwoo concluded that it would be beneficial to eliminate his competitor.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, are you going to move right now?”<br/><br/>He shook his head at Jisu’s question.<br/><br/>“Wait. I always need an upgrade before the big battle.”<br/><br/>“Pardon? Upgrade?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned a Werewolf skeleton. The backpack on his back was bloated, which served as something like an inventory.<br/><br/>Sungwoo continued, “Well, I haven’t opened the legendary item box that I earned after winning the Metropolitan Occupation War.”<br/><br/>At that time, he won five legendary-grade item boxes after winning the Metropolitan Occupation War.<br/><br/>However, he kept delaying opening the box because he was so busy dealing with various urgent matters, so he was still holding them without opening them. Now, he could not put it off any longer.<br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled out all the item boxes.<br/><br/>“Wow, it’s a jackpot!”<br/><br/>With Hanho exclaiming in admiration, he lifted one of them.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Legendary item box<br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/>-Category: Event item<br/><br/>-Effect: When you open it, one ‘legendary level’ item is given at random.<br/><br/>“Wow, five legendary items?

Right?”<br/><br/>But as soon as he tried to open the box, a message that popped out suddenly blocked his eyes.<br/><br/>-You can exchange 5 ‘Legendary Grade Item Boxes’ for one ‘Myth Grade Item Box’.<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>This was a privilege he didn’t expect at all. It looked like he could exchange five item boxes for a higher grade box.<br/><br/>‘Myth grade?’<br/><br/>The myth grade items Sungwoo obtained so far were only three.<br/><br/>The first was the ‘seeds of the world tree’, the second one was the ‘Herculean Bow’, which he could not use yet, and the third one was the ‘Shadow King’s Crown’ he had obtained as a set item.<br/><br/>‘Based on the items I obtained until now, there are tremendous restrictions on using the myth grade items.’<br/><br/>For example, it required 100 stamina to pull the Herculean Bow, and the seeds of the world tree were not easy to plant. The Shadow King’s Crown could also be used only when Sungwoo collected a legacy set.<br/><br/>In other words, the myth-grade items could be a necessary evil. It could have been more effective for Sungwoo to hang the five legendary-grade items on his body.<br/><br/>“Nope, it’s a higher grade than the legendary item.”<br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/>“Hanho, I’m sorry, but I think I might not give you one.”<br/><br/>“Man, you are so mean!”<br/><br/>He had never used the Herculean Bow, but considering the influence of the world tree or the effect of the Shadow King’s Crown, a myth grade had much more power than the five legendary items.<br/><br/>-Would you like to exchange the item? (Y/N)<br/><br/>Sungwoo clicked Y. Then, the five legendary grade item boxes turned into a golden powder then started to unite into one. Soon, a small case was created. It had an emerald color, which gave him the impression that it was a higher grade than the legendary item.<br/><br/>‘Let me open it without any reservation.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo boldly opened the box. Then, a small stick fell from the air.<br/><br/>-You have exchanged it for a ‘myth grade’ item.<br/><br/>When he checked it, it was a fan.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Fan<br/><br/>-Grade: Myth<br/><br/>-Category: Wand<br/><br/>-Effect: Increases magic immunity (+15%) and can control the soul of the dead (ghost). (Maximum 10) The ghost’s performance varies depending on the user’s ‘affinity for death trait.’<br/><br/>-Description: It contains the spirit of ‘the man who controls the ghost.’<br/><br/>Luckily, the item was perfectly suitable for Sungwoo. Besides, there seemed to be no specific conditions for its use. However, when looking at the item description only, it looked rather shabby compared with the previous myth grade item.<br/><br/>‘I can control ghosts with this item?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo felt he needed to use it first to figure out how effective it was, but it looked like he could not expect this item to be as powerful as ‘the Shadow King’s Crown’, which had doubled in power at once.<br/><br/>At that moment, a message rang.<br/><br/>-You have met certain conditions.<br/><br/>* Lich (the one who deals with death) + Fan (the one who controls the ghost) + Unknown (requires additional acquisition)<br/><br/>‘Conditions?’<br/><br/>It was a message similar to the one that he saw when he obtained Anubis first. At that time, he could temporarily use the power of Anubis when his Lich condition was mixed with the human beast condition.<br/><br/>‘What kind of puzzle is this?’<br/><br/>Is it more powerful than Anubis, given that it requires three conditions? Since there was no hint at all, Sungwoo could not figure it out at all.<br/><br/>He turned to look at Jisu and Hanho.<br/><br/>“Alright. Let’s go now. Hanho, you are all set, right?”<br/><br/>As expected, they had to take care of the pending task first.<br/><br/>“Well, I only have a few items. So, I hardly have anything to prepare.”<br/><br/>“Really? Good.”<br/><br/>“What are you talking about?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo passed Hanho and stood in front of Jisu.<br/><br/>“The mountain terrains might look complicated when you look down from the sky, Jisu. Can you find out where the King of the Great Mountains is?”<br/><br/>“Oh, I know how to do it without flying.”<br/><br/>Having said that, she pulled something out of her pocket. Sungwoo thought it was something like a medal, but when he looked closely, it was something like a medal with a horse drawing on the surface.<br/><br/>“The King of the Great Mountains gave this to me, promising to meet me next time. I can go right to him with this.”<br/><br/>“It looks like that monster liked you very much, Jisu.”<br/><br/>Come to think of it, thanks to the King of the Great Mountain, Jisu could teleport to Suwon and Busan in an instant, not to mention her Awakening.<br/><br/>“Ah, this one…”<br/><br/>When she used the item, a turquoise portal opened.<br/><br/>Sungwoo, Jisu, and Hanho entered the portal.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>As soon as they exited the portal, a misty valley unfolded before them.<br/><br/>“Oh, my…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Hanho were distracted by the mysterious scenery at the foot of the mountain.<br/><br/>“When I came here on a school trip, I didn’t feel that Mt. Solak was so mysterious back then. I just can’t remember.”<br/><br/>As Hanho said, there was something different about the mountain that he had been so familiar with.<br/><br/>While walking uphill, escorted by Jisu, they were fascinated by the mountain scenery.<br/><br/>With white frost piling up, a light fog peeled away little by little as they moved forward.<br/><br/>Mountain peaks stretched to the left and right of the winding valley, and scattered clouds were hanging like curtains right under them.<br/><br/>Ooh ooh ooh<br/><br/>As the mountain breeze pulled the edge of the clouds vigorously and pulled the curtain off, a dark stone mountain gradually emerged. It was as if the head of a giant was looking down at Sungwoo’s party.<br/><br/>“Well, don’t you think a mountain god is living somewhere here?”<br/><br/>As the mountain terrains changed steeply, they began to look downward.<br/><br/>Then, the tough roots of centuries-old pine trees continued to spread like a river stream, and white rocks stuck through the greenery were connected like stairs.<br/><br/>Red flowers of unknown names were also blooming in clusters between the rocks.<br/><br/>“It certainly didn’t seem like this from the beginning. It’s rather alien.”<br/><br/>“You bet. This is the kind of place my father likes very much,” said Hanho.<br/><br/>All the mountains also had some sort of mysterious appearance, but now this particular appearance of Mt. Solak seemed to have been modified by the system in one way or another as if its intrinsic characteristics were intended to stand out.<br/><br/>“If we go a little further, we will reach the king’s dwelling,” Jisu said. </div><h2 id="chapter255">Chapter 255</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            While walking uphill, escorted by Jisu, they were fascinated by the mountain scenery.<br/><br/>With white frost piling up, a light fog peeled away little by little as they moved forward.<br/><br/>Mountain peaks stretched to the left and right of the winding valley, and scattered clouds were hanging like curtains right under them.<br/><br/>Ooh ooh ooh<br/><br/>As the mountain breeze pulled the edge of the clouds vigorously and pulled the curtain off, a dark stone mountain gradually emerged. It was as if the head of a giant was looking down at Sungwoo’s party.<br/><br/>“Well, don’t you think a mountain god is living somewhere here?”<br/><br/>As the mountain terrains changed steeply, they began to look downward.<br/><br/>Then, the tough roots of centuries-old pine trees continued to spread like a river stream, and white rocks stuck through the greenery were connected like stairs.<br/><br/>Red flowers of unknown names were also blooming in clusters between the rocks.<br/><br/>“It certainly didn’t seem like this from the beginning. It’s rather alien.”<br/><br/>“You bet. This is the kind of place my father likes very much,” said Hanho.<br/><br/>All the mountains also had some sort of mysterious appearance, but now this particular appearance of Mt. Seorak seemed to have been modified by the system in one way or another as if its intrinsic characteristics were intended to stand out.<br/><br/>“If we go a little further, we will reach the king’s dwelling,” Jisu said.<br/><br/>The king’s dwelling was hidden deep in Mt. Seorak. Of course, it was far off the mountain trail, and there wasn’t even a decent path leading to his place.<br/><br/>So, they got out of the valley and climbed through the pine trees. It was a steep climb, but the rocks and tree roots acted as stairs, so they could easily climb.<br/><br/>“It’s right there.”<br/><br/>Jisu lifted her index finger and pointed somewhere.<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>Hanho showed an absurd expression at that, so did Sungwoo.<br/><br/>There was a hut with a shingle roof in the middle of the mountain.<br/><br/>“Is that where the king lives?”<br/><br/>“Yes. It doesn’t fit his image as the great king, right?”<br/><br/>“Nope, not at all.”<br/><br/>Wasn’t he the “King of the Great Mountain” who unified the whole Gangwon Province and drove out the powerful players’ groups? How could he live in such a shabby hut?<br/><br/>“It feels like a grandfather wearing hemp cloth is going to come out…”<br/><br/>As Hanho said, it was a bit big, but just an old hut where a natural man could live.<br/><br/>And the more they approached the hut, the more embarrassed they were.<br/><br/>“Did I look forward to it too much? I didn’t expect anything like a luxurious house, but this is…”<br/><br/>The area around the hut was flat with a potato field. Farm tools such as plows and sickles were strewn around it, and a handcart was overturned on one side.<br/><br/>The three people in the middle of the field stood out. Two of them were enormously large.<br/><br/>“Why are Weretigers there?”<br/><br/>Human beasts in the form of a tiger, wearing cotton jackets with pickaxes in their hands, were standing there. However, they were different from typical Weretigers. They were huge enough to be five meters in height. Sungwoo’s party would look like cats if they stood before the Weretigers.<br/><br/>One of them found Sungwoo’s party and said, “Uh? Brother! Lady Jisu is here!”<br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/>Then, the man who was hopping on the field sprang to his feet.<br/><br/>“Lady Jisu?”<br/><br/>He was a handsome black-haired man. He stepped out of the shadows of the two monsters and smiled at them. Then, he opened both hands to welcome them.<br/><br/>At that moment, a message appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/>-The field boss monster ‘King of the Great Mountain’ has appeared.<br/><br/>“Ah! You are finally here! Come on. Welcome, welcome!”<br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain was digging up potatoes? He had a hoe in his right hand and potatoes he just dug in his left hand.<br/><br/>Sungwoo and Hanho looked at each other, expressing absurd expressions as if they could not believe it.<br/><br/>“The boss monster is digging up potatoes?”<br/><br/>“Yes! Next to the potato field is a radish and cabbage field. His Majesty seems to work like that for food.”<br/><br/>However, the King of the Great Mountain approached them casually and smiled friendly.<br/><br/>“Oh, my God… I was digging potatoes to eat today. I look like crap as you see…”<br/><br/>The king handed over the hoe and potato to the giant tigers next to him, then rubbed his hands against his pants. His white cotton pants were stained with dirt.<br/><br/>“How should I treat precious guests like you? I’m sorry, but I didn’t cook rice because the cauldron was smashed. I ordered my youngest boy to cook rice, but he broke the lid of the pot in half.”<br/><br/>While saying so, the king pointed to the tiger, five meters tall, standing behind him.<br/><br/>Then, the youngest tiger smiled, embarrassed.<br/><br/>“Well, the pot broke when I gently tapped it…”<br/><br/>“Hey, dude! Didn’t I tell you to control your strength well? Some time ago you kicked while sleeping and broke the wall! Tut, tut!”<br/><br/>As anger spread over the king’s face, the youngest tiger quickly bowed down.<br/><br/>“I’m so sorry!”<br/><br/>Because he was so big, just bending his waist was powerful enough to cause wind.<br/><br/>“You have committed a crime grave enough to have your next three generations punished! Escort them inside politely!”<br/><br/>“Understood. Please come this way!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party stepped into the king’s shabby palace.<br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain, his two minions, and Sungwoo’s party sat face to face at the wooden table.<br/><br/>It was an ordinary table that could be found in a country house, but it was large enough for giant tigers to sit before it.<br/><br/>“Cough! Cough!”<br/><br/>Hanho coughed because the King of the Great Mountain and two tigers were puffing out smoke from a short pipe.<br/><br/>“Ah, don’t you guys smoke cigarettes? I’ve got some more. Are you interested?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>The king was sitting roughly at the table after draping a loose overcoat over his stained clothes.<br/><br/>There was nothing like a king’s aura about him.<br/><br/>A little later one of his minions brought steamed potatoes in a basket, but no one ate.<br/><br/>“These are newly harvested potatoes. Why aren’t you trying them? They are not growing in this season, but I’ve raised them with magic. I owe it to all the grace of our forefathers.”<br/><br/>The two minions bowed, chiming in with him.<br/><br/>“Absolutely!”<br/><br/>However, there was silence for a while after that.<br/><br/>“Hum…”<br/><br/>There was an uncomfortable atmosphere among them. More precisely, the king and Sungwoo felt uncomfortable toward each other because the way Sungwoo looked at him was not kind. There was apparent distrust in his eyes.<br/><br/>“Hmm…”<br/><br/>While the king was puffing out smoke, checking Sungwoo’s moods, Sungwoo opened his mouth first.<br/><br/>“Are you guys monsters?”<br/><br/>That’s the reason why Sungwoo was wary of them. Even though they helped Jisu, there was no change in the fact that they were monsters. And all the monsters he encountered so far existed to kill humans. It has not yet been proven that there may be exceptions.<br/><br/>“Monster…”<br/><br/>The king pouted and spewed smoke over his head.<br/><br/>Then, he slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“You will have no other choice but to think so,” said the king, apparently rejecting Sungwoo’s negative perceptions of the monsters.<br/><br/>“You are denying that? You are a field boss monster.”<br/><br/>“Well, I would not deny that, but I just want to reject it. We were born as monsters and came to this point based on our lack of free will. Only now we can think straight…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought, ‘These guys don’t want to be called a monster? They are different from other monsters.’<br/><br/>The king said that they were not Weretigers, but a race called “tigers.”<br/><br/>In the beginning, they were different monsters, but they evolved repeatedly to obtain their present form.<br/><br/>The king continued, “After waging a lot of bloody struggles, our race has come to occupy Mt. Taebaek. Struggle Guild in Chuncheon attacked us several times for some reason, but we defeated them all.” </div><h2 id="chapter256">Chapter 256</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            The king was exceptionally strong among the tigers. As time passed, he became stronger, eventually gaining tremendous abilities. That’s how he received the title of “King of the Great Mountain.” He said he could disguise himself as a human thanks to his abilities.<br/><br/>He said, “It might sound obvious, but like you, we are also governed by what you call the system.”<br/><br/>It was the first time that a monster mentioned the system since the giant snake Imoogi.<br/><br/>“Do you see the system window too?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/>But the king shook his head, biting the cigarette pipe.<br/><br/>“No. We feel something like a god’s voice. Should I call it what you call a quest? The system constantly forces me to have a sense of purpose, such as searching somewhere or attacking somebody. Anyway…”<br/><br/>He took the pipe off from his mouth and said, “It is bugging me. I wish it could be gone forever!”<br/><br/>He expressed his dissatisfaction with the system vehemently. By expressing disbelief in the system, was he claiming that his race was different from ordinary monsters?<br/><br/>He soon corrected his posture, sat with legs crossed, and put the pipe on his lap.<br/><br/>“Okay, but that’s not important, right? I didn’t want to complain like this when I asked to meet you.”<br/><br/>Finally, he seemed to cut to the chase.<br/><br/>“North Korea?”<br/><br/>“Yeah, some damn guys in my neighborhood are sticking their heads out beyond my walls. Don’t you think we have to think hard about it as someone living in the same territory?”<br/><br/>“So, what’s going on on the North Korean server?”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo asked, the king scratched his chin and continued.<br/><br/>“Well, they have been sick for a long time. I guess the players didn’t respond properly. Eventually, their server was destroyed.”<br/><br/>It was shocking news.<br/><br/>“Ruin?”<br/><br/>“It’s over. Their land is no longer owned by the players.”<br/><br/>What he meant by ‘over’ was the ‘end’ of the North Korean server.<br/><br/>It seemed that the North Korean server had reached the “bad ending.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo knew that the apocalypse could happen more easily than expected because he had already witnessed various bad endings through the prophetic stone.<br/><br/>“The aftermath of that ruined land is gradually spreading. It started affecting this land some time ago. And the first effect was the appearance of a bunch of undead. So, I need you. When it comes to the dead, you are more expert than anyone else, right?”<br/><br/>“Is someone leading the undead now?”<br/><br/>The man who controlled the undead was more important than the undead group.<br/><br/>When asked that question, the king looked straight into his eyes and replied briefly, “Lich.”<br/><br/>“I expected him, too.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo thought that if this was a guy who could control the undead like his army, he was most likely to have the same abilities as himself. And his guess was right.<br/><br/>“Is he a player?”<br/><br/>“No. He’s a monster like me.”<br/><br/>The guy was not in the same occupation group as the Necromancer. Maybe he was a monster born under certain conditions, just like the King of the Great Mountain who survived and became a mighty monster.<br/><br/>“But why are you trying to stop it?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo was curious about the king’s intentions. Monsters’ intentions were usually contrary to the players’. Nonetheless, the king was reaching out to a player.<br/><br/>“Uh? Did you ask me why?”<br/><br/>“If the North Korean server’s Lich is like you, aren’t you closer to him than a player?”<br/><br/>The king laughed as if his question was absurd.<br/><br/>“Well, I live on this land, too, right? Some crazy guys are coming in hordes and trying to pillage our village. We should stop them, of course.”<br/><br/>Was that the only reason? How could a monster like him ask the Necromancer, a player, a favor for the stability of their living conditions?<br/><br/>‘Well, there is no reason that the king could not ask me a favor if he takes off the sunglasses called a monster… But I need to be more suspicious about his motivations.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo was not sure what kind of trouble he would get into if he just trusted the king innocently.<br/><br/>But the king glanced at Sungwoo, then grinned at him as if he understood something.<br/><br/>“Honestly, I understand your position. It’s only natural that you can’t easily accept me when you sit and talk with a monster about our future, a being you had to kill blindly in the past. But…”<br/><br/>He paused and looked at the two Weretigers behind him.<br/><br/>“Hey, guys, we just want to live happily, right?”<br/><br/>They kept nodding. There was some unknown resentment in their eyes.<br/><br/>“Of course!” one of them said.<br/><br/>“I don’t want to fight,” the other said.<br/><br/>The king replied, “Um. But it doesn’t fit you to say that because you look like a monster.”<br/><br/>When he said that, the two tigers snorted as if they were dumbfounded.<br/><br/>“Pardon? How come you are taking issue with our appearances?”<br/><br/>“You look the same as us…”<br/><br/>“Stop it! You are so rude!”<br/><br/>The king giggled at them, then picked up a potato from the basket. There was still steam rising from it.<br/><br/>“Are we so different from other monsters? Well, even if this was intended by the creator who made me, and even if he brainwashed me by whispering in my ears…” he said, taking a bite of the potato. “I just want to live a comfortable life while planting some potatoes and obtaining a stronger pot..”<br/><br/>What he said rang true.<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo thought, ‘Is this guy like an NPC?’<br/><br/>Come to think about it, NPCs, one of the important elements of the game, had not appeared.<br/><br/>Maybe the King of the Great Mountain could also serve as an NPC.<br/><br/>Only then did Sungwoo feel relaxed and nod at him.<br/><br/>“Good. If you give me more information about Lich, let me take a look and deal with him.”<br/><br/>Leaving the issue in North Korea neglected would become a much bigger problem later. So, Sungwoo needed to deal with it before things got out of control.<br/><br/>Right at that moment, something started suddenly.<br/><br/>-(!)<br/><br/>There appeared a red exclamation mark before his eyes, which was not new to him.<br/><br/>“This?”<br/><br/>“Everyone can see this? Yeah, that’s it!”<br/><br/>Jisu and Hanho responded right away.<br/><br/>[Mainstream start guide]<br/><br/>* Everybody, among the many servers in the world, only the Korean server is continuing to move on in an extraordinary manner. For the first time they created the “Third Camp,” and the “world tree”, a transcendental being, is growing.<br/><br/>Originally ‘CHAPTER 4’ intended to cover the two absolute camps, Angels and Demons, but as the power of the two camps is not as strong as the Korean server, it is inevitable that we have to issue a new mainstream. Please prove in the hellish world that the extraordinary achievement of the Korean server, which has made us issue another mainstream, has not been made by any ‘particular man,’<br/><br/>[Caution (Important)]<br/><br/>Sungwoo, Hanho, and Jisu frowned, looking at the message.<br/><br/>“Something bad happened?”<br/><br/>While chewing the potato, the King of the Great Mountain looked at Sungwoo and his friends with serious expressions. He looked quite interested.<br/><br/>Sungwoo faced him and said, “You said you wanted to protect your house, right? This whole land, right?”<br/><br/>“Yeah. Absolutely.”<br/><br/>“Well, I can’t yet recognize you as my neighbor, so take this opportunity to play a landlord. It looks like the system doesn’t want to leave us alone. You will help us defend the Korean server.”<br/><br/>Having heard that, the king swallowed the remaining potato piece, with a smile in his eyes.<br/><br/>“Um, don’t eat this potato. It’s not boiled enough. Who boiled it?”<br/><br/>Then, he rolled up his sleeves. He sprang to his feet and looked down at Sungwoo. </div><h2 id="chapter257">Chapter 257</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Having heard that, the king swallowed the remaining potato piece, with a smile in his eyes.<br/><br/>“Um, don’t eat this potato. It’s not boiled enough. Who boiled it?”<br/><br/>Then, he rolled up his sleeves. He sprang to his feet and looked down at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Sure, I also want to be recognized as a landlord by the strong man in this neighborhood. Someone knows more about the North Korean Lich. I’ll take you to that person.”<br/><br/>“Alright.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t know that he would join hands with the monster like this, but he came to trust the king for some reason.<br/><br/>‘This guy is different. It looks like he is not a monster.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party stood up. It was time for them to get information about the North Korean Lich and respond to the new mainstream.<br/><br/>“Come on, let’s go.”<br/><br/>“Man, you won’t give me a break? Okay, let’s go!”<br/><br/>Games always offered a sudden challenge, and Sungwoo’s party knew how to face it.<br/><br/>No matter how fiercely the system would drive them, they would not leave the Korean server ruined like the North Korean server.<br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain, opened his mouth with a serious expression, touching his chin.<br/><br/>“But I want to ask you one question.”<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>He pointed at the potato basket.<br/><br/>“Do you know how many potatoes we should boil?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s group went down the foot of the mountain, escorted by the king. They were now on their way to someone who had information about the Lich of the North Korean server.<br/><br/>“Well, he is around here…” said the king, who was wearing a bamboo hat, while walking ahead with a cane.<br/><br/>Sungwoo wasn’t sure, but it seemed that the king was wandering a bit.<br/><br/>“Wait a minute. You know how to get there, right?” Hanho asked as if he was frustrated.<br/><br/>“We’re almost there. Don’t look so worried. Am I not the king of this mountain?”<br/><br/>The king then began to walk ahead.<br/><br/>“The guy who knows about the North Korean Lich in detail is a player from the North Korean server?”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo asked, the king raised his hat and nodded.<br/><br/>“Right. Was it 7 days ago? I rescued him when the Ogre brothers were about to eat him when he got lost in the mountain here. After that, the Ogre brothers didn’t even say hello to me. They are so big and heavy, but very narrow-minded.”<br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain was always talkative, so he often got off the main topic.<br/><br/>“So what did the North Korean player do?”<br/><br/>“Oh, it looks like he briefly belonged to the organization that served Lich. Let’s hear the details directly from that guy. We have arrived at our destination finally. Right there.”<br/><br/>When they looked at the place he was pointing at, there was a hut that was no different from the king’s hut.<br/><br/>“An old man and his grandchildren live there, so I had him stay there for now. Master! Come out!”<br/><br/>He screamed, approaching the hut. At that moment, somebody flung open the door, aiming at them with a crossbow.<br/><br/>A white-haired old man, who raised his dark eyebrows and pointed a crossbow at the king’s neck, was about to fire an arrow at him. Then, the king took off his hat and waved his hand urgently.<br/><br/>“Hey, it’s me? Are you deaf now, old man? Please pull yourself together as you live with your grandchildren!”<br/><br/>“What the heck, you goblin! What has brought you here?”<br/><br/>The old man lowered the crossbow and put on a pair of cracked rimless glasses.<br/><br/>“What? You called me a goblin? You are not recognizing that you are my people? If you refuse, let me lift the prohibition order on the Ogres and the trolls who might approach you.”<br/><br/>“You mean goblin…”<br/><br/>The king naturally sat down on the floor. Then, the sound of the children in the room was heard.<br/><br/>“Wow, goblin uncle is here!”<br/><br/>“Uncle, where are the tiger uncles?”<br/><br/>A boy, who seemed five years old, came out of the room and clung to the king’s shoulder.<br/><br/>Watching them interacting like that, Sungwoo felt pretty strange.<br/><br/>‘A monster hanging out with a small child? I can’t understand…’<br/><br/>The king grinned while stroking the child’s hair. The king looked like a friendly uncle who liked his cousins and nephews.<br/><br/>“Oh, my…Goblin? You guys are speaking like your grandfather. Your tiger uncles are busy plowing a field. We don’t have a cow.”<br/><br/>Soon, the children’s gaze rested on Sungwoo’s party.<br/><br/>“Uh? Sis Jisu is here too!”<br/><br/>“Sis Jisu!”<br/><br/>“How are you guys?”<br/><br/>Jisu also seemed to have built a close relationship with them while wandering through the mountains.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the old man prepared a dining table for his guests while grumbling about their sudden visit.<br/><br/>“Why are you suddenly visiting my house whenever you can and bothering me? I’m so confused right now, so drink a glass of juice and beat it quickly.”<br/><br/>It was a bowl of puffed rice and orange juice. The old man handed them stainless steel cups one by one with his rough hands.<br/><br/>“Wow, thanks for serving us your favorite fruit juice? It looks like you are giving us such a good treat today because of our new guests. I’m so moved!”<br/><br/>“Don’t talk nonsense, you goblin!”<br/><br/>“Haha! But where is Mr. Lee? I don’t see him…”<br/><br/>The king scanned the old man, frowning at him, and asked, “You complained he was a Red! Did you throw him away in the mountain?”<br/><br/>At that moment, somebody was heard approaching them from the backyard.<br/><br/>A bearded man walked over to them.<br/><br/>“Oh, you are here. Sorry. I didn’t know you came because I was working in the backyard.”<br/><br/>-His excessive local dialect has been ‘auto filtered.<br/><br/>“Oh, he’s coming. That guy is our informant, Sungho Lee, who has come down from the north. He was once a vulgar man who served Lich, but he has come to his senses. So, don’t make him your subordinate spirit.”<br/><br/>“You are too talkative, you goblin!” said the old man, who put on his rubber shoes, then went out to the yard.<br/><br/>Then, the king pointed his finger at the old man’s back.<br/><br/>“Now that we have to discuss the important matter, please excuse us, old man!”<br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo sat face to face with Sungho and heard from him about the situation on the North Korean server.<br/><br/>The beginning of the North Korean server was not that different from that of the South Korean server. Faced with the sudden disaster, the players awakened and made desperate efforts to survive.<br/><br/>However, since North Korean society itself was not familiar with games and electronic systems, they expressed an unusually strong resistance to the phenomenon unfolding before their eyes.<br/><br/>“I think there were more human beasts than the players.”<br/><br/>That’s the state of the North Korean server that Sungho recalled. More people did not draw cards than those who did.<br/><br/>“A lot of people hesitated to choose because their seniors told them never to touch the cards that suddenly popped up. Even the Workers’ Party sent a directive that they should not even touch the cards, arguing that it was a cunning trick set by the US imperialists…”<br/><br/>According to him, those who were determined to survive drew the cards and succeeded in creating a self-governing organization.<br/><br/>They acted in groups, responded to the monsters, and cleared the quests, but faced a big obstacle.<br/><br/>“After all, the problem was the military that drew cards and restored their power. They ordered the players of our autonomous forces to obey and move under the party’s authority.”<br/><br/>However, the people who built their strength could not follow their orders obediently.<br/><br/>Although they tried to maintain their autonomy, by all means, the problem was that many within the self-governing organization were still ideologically shaken.<br/><br/>“It’s funny that those who were ideologically strong tried to stigmatize others as traitors, and as a result, the self-governing group’s support was greatly reduced…” </div><h2 id="chapter258">Chapter 258</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “They were just stupid.”<br/><br/>So, while they, divided into two groups, were locked in a fierce fight in the city, the monsters gained strength in the remote areas where they weren’t noticed.<br/><br/>The neglected ‘raid boss monster’ became a ‘warlord monster’, and when he was left alone, he grew to be the ‘king of monsters.’<br/><br/>“To put it simply, there are lots of guys like me in the north, right?” the King of the Great Mountain said, pointing to his chest.<br/><br/>Sungho said with a nod, “You bet.”<br/><br/>“That’s the worst situation,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/>The king tilted his head at Sungwoo’s words.<br/><br/>“Uh? Are you serious? I hope I heard you wrong…” said the king.<br/><br/>“Yes, I am. Please continue, Sungho.”<br/><br/>” Anyway, neither the self-governing forces nor the military could stop the monster army.”<br/><br/>Because the two forces were eager to destroy each other, they could not beef up their strength enough to beat the monsters.<br/><br/>At the end, when the two forces disintegrated, a “bad ending” message appeared on the entire North Korean server.<br/><br/>After that, the mainstream or quests were not issued, and the ‘player guidebook’ app did not work. All functions such as community and broadcasting stations were shut down.<br/><br/>“So our land has turned into a hell dominated by monsters. And one of those rulers is that Lich. Currently, he is the ruler of Kaesung, the southern part of North Korea.”<br/><br/>“Just one?”<br/><br/>“Yes, there is only one Lich. But there are several thousand under his authority who don’t die.”<br/><br/>“Several thousand…”<br/><br/>Even Sungwoo, who obtained the deity status, couldn’t control several thousands of undead. It was not likely that the North Korean Lich had a higher grade than Sungwoo. Probably he might enjoy the privilege of being called the king of monsters.<br/><br/>“You said there were players worshipping Lich, right?”<br/><br/>“Yes. Those who have nowhere to go have started serving monsters. In particular, Lich actively accepted wizard-type players and trained them as ‘Death Priests’.”<br/><br/>Just as Jisu made the first Awakening with the help of the King of the Great Mountain, the players of the ruined North Korean server also served the king of monsters while trying to “change their occupations.”<br/><br/>Maybe his ability to control several thousands of Lich had something to do with his ability to make the players his subordinate spirits.<br/><br/>“Where is it?” Sungwoo asked directly.<br/><br/>Then, Sungho’s face hardened a bit. Since he escaped from that place at the risk of his life, he had very bad memories of that place.<br/><br/>“It’s a place called Temple, but the people there are so cruel and heinous. There are dozens of death priests gathered there. It’s a terrible place. You can confront them, but I hope you won’t go there.”<br/><br/>Sungwoo smiled at him faintly.<br/><br/>“It sounds like a pretty good place to me.”<br/><br/>Sungho made an awkward expression as if he could not understand.<br/><br/>The place called “Temple” was among the mountains in the southern part of Kaesong City.<br/><br/>Two pyramids made of gray stones stood facing each other on top of a desolate ridge that had been stripped of grass and trees due to reckless development. Hundreds of crows flew around the ugly edifice that looked like the architecture of an ancient civilization.<br/><br/>In the center of the basement of the pyramid was a huge altar.<br/><br/>With twelve torches swaying to light up the darkness, 20 Death Priests were seated around the altar.<br/><br/>They were sitting with their legs crossed and controlling a horde of zombies across the distance. Their mission was to increase the number of zombies by attacking groups of survivors and monsters around them.<br/><br/>Then, a problem arose.<br/><br/>“Chief Priest, we have lost contact with the zombie group in the southeast. I think they were attacked by somebody.”<br/><br/>At that report, the chief priest shook his hand, as if it was not a big deal.<br/><br/>“Send a crow to check.”<br/><br/>It was often the case that a group of weak zombies was annihilated by monsters on the field. His briefing continued.<br/><br/>“Well, our communication line with another group of zombies has been cut off! There seems to be something happening in that area.”<br/><br/>“It’s annoying. Forward Soldier Crow, do you see anything unusual happening there?”<br/><br/>“Not yet, sir. Let me have him fly further!”<br/><br/>A little later the source of the turmoil was revealed.<br/><br/>“Someone showed up about 8 kilometers away from us. They seem to be coming to the temple. Perhaps they are the killer who got rid of our zombie hordes.”<br/><br/>“How many are they?”<br/><br/>“Just one.”<br/><br/>Only one? The chief priest scoffed at that.<br/><br/>“Just one? It looks like he got lost. Send a squad of zombies and make him a zombie, too.”<br/><br/>One unit was composed of 300 zombies. If they closed in on him from all directions, he would not be able to confront them no matter how high of a level he was.<br/><br/>After issuing such an order, the chief priest stopped thinking about it. Instead, he infused power into a crow in the northern mountains and supervised his subordinates making corpse golems.<br/><br/>However, he was bothered constantly.<br/><br/>“Chief Priest, you should take a look at this.”<br/><br/>“What is it?” he asked annoyingly.<br/><br/>The priest hesitantly put down a black crystal ball in front of him.<br/><br/>“The zombies dispatched to kill the intruder are weird. They won’t follow our directions!”<br/><br/>The chief priest laid his hand on the crystal ball. Then, he was connected with the eyes of a crow.<br/><br/>Soon, he could see 300 zombies gathered somewhere.<br/><br/>“Who the hell is that guy?”<br/><br/>A player was walking leisurely among the zombie troops. When he stepped forward, the zombies got out of his way.<br/><br/>Like parting in the Red Sea, the terrible bodies moved to either side of him easily.<br/><br/>“Why aren’t they attacking him?”<br/><br/>“We issued an order to them, but they won’t follow it!”<br/><br/>“Chief Priest! The intruder has broken through the 8-km boundary and is now approaching the 4-km boundary!”<br/><br/>The situation was unfolding unpredictably.<br/><br/>“What kind of player is he?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know! When he gets close to us, you won’t need to possess the crow any longer. I think we can get more information about him when he gets closer to us!”<br/><br/>“That’s enough. It looks like he has a strange item, but when he comes within the 4-km boundary, explode the corpses and rip him apart. How dare he try to come here?”<br/><br/>The temple’s security was very tight. Its surrounding area was defended by numerous zombies. Even if the intruder broke through them, he had to face an ‘explosion zone’ where the corpses had been buried underground.<br/><br/>“If that guy recklessly sets foot in our territory, he is going to be killed by the hellish flames. No matter how strong of a tank he is, he can’t walk into our territory without being killed.”<br/><br/>Kung- Kuwoong-<br/><br/>At that moment, there was an explosion outside the 4-km boundary, which caused stone fragments to fall from the ceiling. A corpse explosion occurred at the chief priest’s order.<br/><br/>“Did you kill him?”<br/><br/>“Oh no! The explosion occurred before he stepped on it.”<br/><br/>What the heck was this?<br/><br/>“What? Who executed my order too soon?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Since corpses were not ordinary gunpowder, corpses would never explode unless someone cast the ‘Corpse Explosion’ spell. The chief priest concluded that it was the mistake of his subordinates.<br/><br/>“Damn idiots! You should have waited a little longer! Who the hell did it?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>No one admitted to the mistake. The chief priest wanted to find out the culprit and punish him severely, but his priority at the moment was to kill the intruder approaching him first.<br/><br/>The chief priest stood up with his hands folded behind his back.<br/><br/>Then, he looked nervously at the crystal ball.<br/><br/>“The intruder will come into the temple. He’s not lost. He was planning to come here from the beginning. If he enters the temple, spray poison gas and kill him.” </div><h2 id="chapter259">Chapter 259</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            The chief priest stood up with his hands folded behind his back.<br/><br/>Then, he looked nervously at the crystal ball.<br/><br/>“The intruder will come into the temple. He’s not lost. He was planning to come here from the beginning. If he enters the temple, spray poison gas and kill him.”<br/><br/>The temple was guarded with multiple layers of security. Although part of its security was destroyed by the priest’s simple mistake, the security around the temple was still very tight.<br/><br/>As soon as the intruder entered the entrance, the door would close and powerful poison gas would fill the area.<br/><br/>“Good. Come on in!”<br/><br/>The chief priest confirmed through the crystal ball that the intruder was entering the temple.<br/><br/>At that moment, he ordered his subordinate to pull the prepared lever.<br/><br/>Clatter!<br/><br/>The entrance closed by itself, and black smoke filled the hallway. Even if a priest possessed a lot of recovery magic, he could not survive in this situation.<br/><br/>“Yeah, you are going to wriggle in agony and die.”<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>However, a shocking scene appeared in the crystal ball. The intruder was leisurely walking through the poison gas without any damage.<br/><br/>“No way! What the hell is happening now?”<br/><br/>Rather, the poison gas only added grandeur to his footsteps, like the fog arising on a stage.<br/><br/>The chief priest became nervous.<br/><br/>“This is our last resort! Free all the zombie dogs!”<br/><br/>Clatter!<br/><br/>Another lever was pulled. It was the last lever. The iron bars at the end of the temple hallway opened, and dozens of zombie dogs furiously ran along the temple hallway.<br/><br/>But the next scene was even more amazing.<br/><br/>“Oh, my God… What the hell are they doing now…?”<br/><br/>The zombie dogs running at the intruder folded their ears and wagged their tails gently as if they were welcoming their master home.<br/><br/>“Our defensive line has collapsed! He is now coming down to the basement!”<br/><br/>Only then did the chief priest recognize the seriousness of the situation.<br/><br/>“This is not the player we can handle…”<br/><br/>Then, the chief priest looked at the center of the altar with a desperate expression.<br/><br/>There was a coffin covered with red silk.<br/><br/>“Wake him up.”<br/><br/>Priests here and there swallowed and grew tense.<br/><br/>“Are you sure? Should we awaken death?”<br/><br/>“Chief Priest, if we wake him up, death will fall upon us too.”<br/><br/>The chief priest was determined.<br/><br/>“Wake him up. We have no other way right now.”<br/><br/>Eventually, the ceremony to awaken the owner of the coffin began. All 20 Death Priests folded their hands together and cast the same summoning magic.<br/><br/>Ooh ooh ooh-<br/><br/>The purple magic gathered at the center of the altar. Then, the red silk slowly lifted.<br/><br/>Kieeeeeeeeeee-<br/><br/>The sound of the coffin opening filled the air. A gloomy wind blew from somewhere and extinguished the surrounding torches at once.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>With only the purple magic emitting a gloomy light, black smoke sprang up inside the coffin.<br/><br/>“How dare you guys wake me up! Crackle!”<br/><br/>A hysterical voice came out. In particular, the sound of the teeth bumping together was loud like castanets. The chief priest ran and laid face down in front of the coffin.<br/><br/>“Prophet of Death! I apologize!”<br/><br/>“Crackle! What’s going on? Crackle! If it’s nothing special, I’ll make all of you parts of the Flesh Golem.”<br/><br/>Thud! Ku-woong!<br/><br/>At that moment, a loud roaring sounded, replacing the chief priest’s reply.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“Finally, the intruder has entered our temple!”<br/><br/>The Lich’s eyes sparkled in the black smoke. There was deep resentment in his eyes.<br/><br/>Kugugugu―<br/><br/>At that moment, a stone gate, which had been locked tightly, shattered.<br/><br/>While the Death Priests looked astonished, an unidentified intruder walked in leisurely.<br/><br/>He was a man wearing a dark green robe.<br/><br/>“You bastard, how dare you intrude upon our temple?” The chief priest yelled at him.<br/><br/>The Death Priests stood up and retreated to both sides. Since they realized they could not confront him, they stepped back.<br/><br/>Thus, Lich and the intruder were facing each other.<br/><br/>“Oh, Prophet of Death! Punish that ignorant stranger and give him a terrible death!”<br/><br/>“Please!”<br/><br/>The black smoke cleared, revealing Lich’s glowing purple eyes. A bizarre skeleton with the great nickname of the Prophet of Death looked at the strange intruder.<br/><br/>Crackle! Crackle! Crackle! Crackle! Crackle!<br/><br/>He was trembling violently, bumping his teeth.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, other players on the Korean server also showed various reactions in response to the new mainstream.<br/><br/>“Can you see it? That’s the North Korean server.”<br/><br/>Reporter Ahn’s broadcast attracted many viewers. While covering the major events of the Korean server, he captured important moments on the camera, which established his broadcast as the main broadcasting station of the Korean server.<br/><br/>His broadcast had become a media company with 11 employees.<br/><br/>“The ‘Reporter Ahn’s Apocalyptic News’ team is here on the scene before anyone else!”<br/><br/>Although they could not cover the “Korean-Japanese War” that took place in Busan, they hurried to the place near the DMZ in Paju and flew a drone camera as soon as the mainstream began.<br/><br/>Weeeeeeeeeeing―<br/><br/>Four drone cameras exited the South Korean server and entered the border of the North Korean server.<br/><br/>The broadcast screens changed in real-time with the angles of the cameras. Thanks to the state-of-the-art item called ‘Multi Controller’, they could send out multiple broadcasts at the same time.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>At that time, something was caught on camera. Reporter Ahn immediately added his narration.<br/><br/>“Ah! They’re zombies! Let me turn over to No. 2 camera for a close-up.”<br/><br/>When Reporter Ahn beckoned, an employee manipulated the controller. Then, more specific things were broadcast on the screen.<br/><br/>When the camera captured the scenes of the territory of the North Korean server beyond the DMZ, a large number of zombies were shown crowding in one place.<br/><br/>“Oh, my God….”<br/><br/>Thousands of zombies were standing along the deserted ridges.<br/><br/>“There are so many zombies! Thousands of zombies are lining up, looking south! It seems like they are rushing to the south!”<br/><br/>Even though they were just gathered without taking any action, their presence posed a considerable threat.<br/><br/>“Is that the start of disaster coming from the North Korean server? Let’s go up a little further north!”<br/><br/>Reporter Ahn’s drone flew the farthest distance it could while remaining under their control.<br/><br/>“Oh my! That stuff is…”<br/><br/>What came out on the screen was also shocking. Hundreds of troll troops were checking their armament, and hordes of Orcs and goblins were gathered behind them.<br/><br/>The reason such a scene was so shocking was that the three races were uniting to prepare for war, something that could not be seen on the South Korean server.<br/><br/>At that moment, there was white noise on the screen, which meant that the drone reached the limit of its control range.<br/><br/>“This is all we can show you for now, but it looks like a big war is about to break out. I feel something like the harbinger of war.”<br/><br/>Some unknown smoke was rising from all over the land of North Korea. It was like the smoke of people cooking rice. If that was true, it meant that a huge army was now moving to the south.<br/><br/>“Then, how should we respond to them in the future?”<br/><br/>-ID ‘Steel Shield’ gave donations! (1000 gold)<br/><br/>As a leading camera operator, he was now receiving financial support from the watchers of his broadcast.<br/><br/>“Thank you for your support! Even if the Korean server collapses, we will capture all the scenes even in hell to the end!”<br/><br/>Thanks to his broadcast, some of the reality of Death coming down from the North Korean server was revealed to a very small extent.<br/><br/>But its impact was so huge. </div><h2 id="chapter260">Chapter 260</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            ‘One Heart Association’, an association of survivor groups in Paju, had no choice but to react to the mainstream this time. Geographically, they faced the North Korean server, so they should brace for the possible disaster.<br/><br/>Because of that, seven groups living in Paju gathered together. They held an emergency meeting.<br/><br/>“Hasn’t all this happened because of that bastard, the Necromancer? Why do we have to suffer damage when we are living peacefully here?”<br/><br/>“Yes, you’re right. Let’s post a condemning statement on the community right away. How long can we stay silent?”<br/><br/>“You bet! I’ve never had this kind of bolt out of the blue in my life!”<br/><br/>They had never come to the fore until now, but they built a considerable force on their own.<br/><br/>They were comprised of five groups with a total of 3,000 survivors.<br/><br/>“If the Necromancer hadn’t moved around frivolously from the beginning, this wouldn’t have happened!”<br/><br/>“Tut! Tut! I knew that bastard would bring about big trouble someday!”<br/><br/>They concluded that this main quest was a human disaster caused by the Necromancer and agreed to hold the World Tree camp accountable.<br/><br/>One Heart Association was not the only organization that showed such a hostile reaction.<br/><br/>[1,015] Necromancer, take responsibility and cut down the world tree.<br/><br/>-Author: Dave Choi │ Hits: 51,453<br/><br/>No matter how good you are, this is not something you can tackle.

You guys should give it a thought before posting your articles!<br/><br/>Except for a few, lots of people on the Korean server outpoured their complaints about the Necromancer.<br/><br/>They watched the numerous incidents that had happened on the Korean server as bystanders, but when they were faced with a real threat this time, they didn’t sit idle.<br/><br/>The people in Suwon village were also checking their reaction. While checking every comment on the community bulletin, Heyon felt irresistible anger.<br/><br/>“Look at this, Dad. How rude they are! This is the way they are reacting.”<br/><br/>She ran to her father Muyon and showed him her cell phone.<br/><br/>“Look what these people are babbling about! These guys were stuck in their rooms and didn’t do anything even when the whole village was flooding. How dare they try to complain like this?”<br/><br/>However, Muyon, who read all the bad comments, remained calm instead of sympathizing with her.<br/><br/>“Heyon, don’t bother about that.”<br/><br/>“How can’t I, Dad? What do they know about the Necromancer? They are spitting out disrespectful words when they don’t know anything about him. What if other people agree with them?”<br/><br/>Although Heyon was seething with anger, Muyon was still working on the “castle wall blueprint” without any change in his facial expressions.<br/><br/>“Honey, there are people like that everywhere. Those who are smart and know which way the wind is blowing find the right way for themselves.”<br/><br/>“But what if these people behave nasty?”<br/><br/>“Their complaints are nothing in this world. Think of their complaints as a child’s whining.”<br/><br/>“Do you think so?”<br/><br/>“Sure. Just wait and see.”<br/><br/>As he said, their negative opinions briefly appeared on the server but didn’t last long. Above all, they were far from the mainstream opinion on the Korean server.<br/><br/>Many on the Korean servers supported the Necromancer. Besides, the huge forces that held the real power of each region supported the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“Wow, they have begun to support Necromancer!”<br/><br/>“I told you so! If you go on the right path, they will follow you.”<br/><br/>The first group to participate in the upcoming war was “Hunter Company” in Chonan.<br/><br/>[1,024] The Hunter Company supports the World Tree camp and joins their fight.<br/><br/>-Author: President Baek │ Hit: 111,463<br/><br/>*We plan to temporarily suspend all our business and start an all-out battle to protect the South Korean server.

It was damage left by the Necromancer who appeared at the dramatic moment when the Japanese ninjas stormed in a few days ago.<br/><br/>“It’s all thanks to the Necromancer that this building, our company, and all of us have survived.”<br/><br/>When he turned around, muttering like that, there were about a hundred employees lined up behind him. All of them were ready for the upcoming battle.<br/><br/>Junho looked around them and shouted, “We must repay his help! So we will protect the world tree from the invasion of the North Korean server by joining hands with the Necromancer!”<br/><br/>He spoke like a general. All of the staff responded loudly to his words.<br/><br/>“Understood!”<br/><br/>“Okay!”<br/><br/>Although they were smaller than other groups, they were elites who had been trained as mercenaries throughout the country.<br/><br/>“Good…”<br/><br/>Junho felt overwhelmed by their spontaneous support. He had a considerable reputation for his mercenary business, but he felt like he began something extraordinary.<br/><br/>‘If I can draw the Necromancer’s attention by doing this…”<br/><br/>He already became an ardent follower of the Necromancer.<br/><br/>He decided to join the Necromancer in the upcoming battle partly because he was the latter’s avid fan.<br/><br/>“All Hunter Company employees, prepare for a march to the north immediately!”<br/><br/>“Yes, sir!”<br/><br/>The ‘Hwarang Guild’ in Busan also declared their support of the Necromancer.<br/><br/>Although they suffered tremendous damage following the Japanese server’s invasion, they had no intention of sitting idle when the mainstream started again, for they also knew that they survived thanks to the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“The World Tree camp had warned us of the Japanese aggression even before the Korean-Japanese War broke out.”<br/><br/>“We ignored the warning and responded foolishly…”<br/><br/>The leaders of the Hwarang Guild discussed the issue of participation in the mainstream war at an emergency meeting.

Everyone must work together regardless of which camp they belong to, just like the Necromancer of the World Tree camp did.”<br/><br/>“I agree! This is also for the sake of the entire South Korean server.”<br/><br/>Moreover, as one of the central forces of the South Korean server, the Hwarang Guild had a sense of responsibility to solve the problem.

                            The last to express support for the Necromancer were the players in Uijeongbu.

After that, they were in the process of creating a new organization under the supervision of the Liberation Guild. Fortunately, they could join hands with the Necromancer, though belatedly.<br/><br/>As a result, all those who had some direct or indirect ties with the Necromancer expressed their intention to participate in the all-out war, regardless of whether they were affiliated with the Angel or Demon camp.<br/><br/>Although they have not yet issued an official statement, it was a fait accompli that the Liberation Guild would also fight with the Necromancer.<br/><br/>Hanho and Jisu, who were preparing to carry out other operations while staying at the king’s hut, were watching the whole situation through the community.<br/><br/>“Really? This actually means a great integration of all the Korean server members, right? Apart from these big groups, even small groups have also started declaring their participation, too.”<br/><br/>As Hanho said, numerous forces of the South Korean server declared their participation in the war and began to rally around the Necromancer.<br/><br/>“If this is the case, I think we can mobilize more troops than we did during the warlord monster event.”<br/><br/>“You bet. After all, the warring states period is over, isn’t it?”<br/><br/>When the large groups declared their alliance with the Necromancer one by one, those who harshly criticized the Necromancer began to disappear overnight. Instead, there was a growing voice for the unity of various groups to protect the Korean server.<br/><br/>Of course, None of those who criticized the Necromancer came out to join hands with the Necromancer.<br/><br/>There was a gathering cloud of war over the South Korean server.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Meanwhile, apart from the formation of his alliance groups, Sungwoo was driving out the monsters of the North Korean server.<br/><br/>The 20 Death Priests were driven out of the room where the altar was and gathered in the corridor. Inside the room, Sungwoo and the North Korean Lich were talking face to face.<br/><br/>“Chief Priest, what will happen to us?”<br/><br/>Since they could not know what the two leaders were talking about inside the room, they were frustrated.<br/><br/>“Well, If you’re lucky, you’ll probably be working for that man.”<br/><br/>“Pardon? Who the hell is that man? How can our prophet of death become so miserable before that stranger…”<br/><br/>At that moment, some terrible sound was heard by his bedside. It was the sound of the zombie dogs. The 20 Death Priests were entangled with them and stuck in the corner of the hallway.<br/><br/>“Chief Priest? They aren’t biting people, right?”<br/><br/>“No, but they are eating people.”<br/><br/>“Oops! Hiccup!”<br/><br/>“So, don’t move and stay put in your place if you don’t want to be eaten.”<br/><br/>The fear of death was approaching the Death Priests.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the situation inside the altar room was serious. The North Korean Lich was sitting in a small chair straight up with his hands placed on his knees to maintain an upright posture.<br/><br/>Although he was seated in such a proper position, he kept moving his chin.<br/><br/>Crackle! Crackle! Crackle!<br/><br/>“Close your mouth!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>He immediately stopped moving his jaw at Sungwoo’s shout. Sungwoo was sitting in front of him, holding his black scythe in his hand and staring at him. Behind him, Minsok and Orun stood on his right and left.<br/><br/>Purrrrrrrrr―<br/><br/>The headless knight on a giant monster horse, Durahan, was holding a big sword as if he would rush to the Lich right away. Since the severed head in his left hand was staring at him, Lich had no choice but to feel scared despite his status as Lich.<br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo opened his mouth, “What’s your name?”<br/><br/>Lich Victor was really happy Sungwoo asked him.<br/><br/>“My name is Lich Victor!”<br/><br/>“What can you do?”<br/><br/>“I can control up to 2,000 low-level zombies! However, if I raise 20 Death Priests, I can control an additional 50 per priest.”<br/><br/>Victor tried to put his best foot forward as if he was having a job interview, but Sungwoo’s expression was coldness itself.<br/><br/>Victor’s hollow and glowing eyes trembled anxiously, looking at Sungwoo and Minsok alternately.<br/><br/>At that moment, Minsok, who was standing next to him, opened his mouth, “This monster can think. Wouldn’t it be better to kill him to get rid of the cause of possible troubles? If you don’t mind, let me behead him right away. Then, you might be able to meet the conditions for certification of your qualifications completely.”<br/><br/>“Ah! Wait a minute!”<br/><br/>Victor tried to defend himself, but Sungwoo cut him off and opened his mouth.<br/><br/>“Who else is there above the monsters who have received the title of king?”<br/><br/>“Oh, the kings only serve the emperor, just one rank higher than them.”<br/><br/>“Emperor?”<br/><br/>“Yes, the monster called the emperor is the strongest among the monsters that have earned the title of king. Crackle! It’s safe to say he is the highest-grade monster on a server!”<br/><br/>The more they were left alone, the more the boss monsters grew, but they were usually in the order of raid boss, warlord, and king in terms of hierarchy. However, it seemed that the emperor was on top of them.<br/><br/>“Aren’t you serving him too?”<br/><br/>“Of course, I am,” said Victor, nodding awkwardly.<br/><br/>“So, you want to follow me from now on?”<br/><br/>“Of course! My job is to serve death above all else!”<br/><br/>As if to prove he was serious about it, a message appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/>-You can use the same type (undead) monster ‘Lich (Victor)’ as your subordinate spirit.<br/><br/>* Because he has an ‘independent will’, he can “act” outside your influence.<br/><br/>* The target will obey your order.<br/><br/>Given the contents of the message, Sungwoo judged that he could trust this Lich.<br/><br/>‘Although this guy is a low-level zombie who can’t be resurrected, it’s going to be a tremendous increase in my power if he can control thousands of zombies,’ Sungwoo thought.<br/><br/>Without any hesitation, Sungwoo immediately took Victor as his subordinate spirit.<br/><br/>Then, his eyes became even deeper and clearer. Obviously, he was feeling relieved, knowing he would not be killed.<br/><br/>“Crackle! Crackle! Thank you for choosing me!”<br/><br/>He suddenly sprang to his feet and bowed to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Sungwoo stood up and said, “Show me you are helpful to me.”<br/><br/>It was time for Sungwoo to test his new weapon.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>There was an outpost of the One Heart Association in Munsan Town in Paju.<br/><br/>It was a fortress they prepared for the possible disaster from the north, which was a pentagonal structure they built by mobilizing three architects.<br/><br/>Right now, it was under attack by the enemy.<br/><br/>“The northern fence has collapsed! Send us reinforcement troops!”<br/><br/>An army of monsters mixed with trolls, orcs, and goblins filled the north side of the fortress.<br/><br/>They came across the DMZ to the south earlier than expected.<br/><br/>“Damn it, I thought the hordes of zombies would come first. How come those monsters came so early?”<br/><br/>“Reinforcement troops are coming soon! Let’s hold out a little longer! If we are pushed back by them, we will suffer huge damage!”<br/><br/>The One Heart Association could not give up Paju because if they lost it, they lost everything they had achieved through hard work.<br/><br/>Of course, they also had hope they could protect all of that.<br/><br/>“I hear the Liberation Guild and the Hunter Company will arrive within an hour to come to our rescue, so if we can hold out until then…”<br/><br/>They pinned hope on the fact that they would get help from giant groups that declared their participation in the war. However, their hopes quickly fell apart. </div><h2 id="chapter262">Chapter 262</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “I hear the Liberation Guild and the Hunter Company will arrive within an hour to come to our rescue, so if we can hold out until then…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They pinned hope on the fact that they would get help from giant groups that declared their participation in the war. However, their hopes quickly fell apart.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Captain!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What’s the matter?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thousands of zombies are coming down from the north in droves!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The hordes of zombies that he expected would come down first finally began to move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! If they come down now…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right now, just stopping the monster army was overwhelming for them. If thousands of zombies joined them, it would be a disaster for the players in Paju.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We really can’t defend against them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They would collapse helplessly like a small embankment swept away by a tsunami.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Reporter Ahn was filming all of these scenes from the roof of a building a few hundred meters from the fortress.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah! Gosh! Hordes of zombies are coming down in droves! They are huge!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even Reporter Ahn spoke in an embarrassed voice, faced with such an unexpected situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They can’t stop the zombies! It’s impossible to stop them! They are on the verge of annihilation! If any of you coming to help the Paju players right now are watching our broadcast, we hope you hurry up! Their fortress is going to collapse quite soon!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, an unexpected situation occurred once more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The hordes of zombies that approached the rear of the monster army started attacking the monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is happening now?<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if they didn’t expect such a situation at all, the monster army was wiped away helplessly. They started resisting belatedly, but the hordes of zombies that already arrived weren’t easy to stop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if the dam broke, the horde of zombies penetrated the monster army, who began to collapse after their formation was broken.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Reporter Ahn opened his mouth wide at that shocking scene.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can’t believe how the zombies could attack the monsters…No, I can’t believe this… I wonder if this was possible because of…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He didn’t know what was going on, but he realized who was responsible for the zombies’ indiscriminate attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is it the Necromancer?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer moved.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monster army attacking the Paju Fortress thought mistakenly that the hordes of zombies coming down were their friendly forces. They were dispatched by the Necromancer to help the Paju players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, the moment the Orcs, who were on standby in the rear, had their necks bitten by the zombies, all they did was watch them helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kheeeeeeeeek!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was natural. Didn’t the zombies originally attack the Korean server while serving the ‘monster emperor’ like them? How could they attack monsters like them from behind?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unless they were players, monsters wouldn’t attack other monsters because they shared common interests. Therefore, they had no choice but to be attacked by the zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The army of monsters from the north has begun to collapse because of the hordes of zombies from the north!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Reporter Ahn, witnessing the actual scenes of their fighting, was conveying what was going on in real-time in an excited voice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, as if they didn’t expect it at all, they were completely caught off guard! By the way, I am not sure if the hordes of zombies are the Necromancer’s subordinate spirits. They had been affiliated with the North Korean server for a long time, but how could they come down to the south like that…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Reporter Ahn could not grasp the exact situation. But he knew one thing for sure. The only one who could send out zombies like this was the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was becoming clearer who would emerge as the winner of the battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Oooooooh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although these low-level zombies dispatched by the Necromancer were weaker than Orcs, they attacked from all directions, so the monster army could not withstand their attack. Even if they killed one zombie, two zombies immediately counterattacked them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the zombies attacked without fearing death, the monsters could not afford to recalibrate their attack. It was as if they were facing an unstoppable landslide.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrr-<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, the monster army was gradually losing their fighting spirit since they were exposed to the zombies’ attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alright! Now is the time!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Above all, the fact that their retreat was blocked was a fatal blow to the enemy forces.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They’re offensive has weakened! It’s time for us to demonstrate our firepower!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Cast the ranged magic!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, the Paju players, who survived the enemies’ offensive, began to demonstrate a wide range of firepower while focusing on their attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the enemies’ retreat was blocked, there was nowhere they could escape. So, the Paju players’ ranged attacks dealt intense and lethal damage to the enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are collapsing!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s finish this fight! Everybody, get ready to charge them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Paju players who gained the momentum to turn the tide aggressively charged at the monsters to end the fighting as soon as possible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Goo Goo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, the iron gate of the fortress opened. At that moment, two 20-ton trucks pushed ahead to open the way for the players. Tankers ran out in a row and lifted their shields.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ready to push them with the shields!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s sweep them away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the addition of the hordes of zombies dispatched by the Necromancer, they were no longer inferior to the enemies numerically, which made them fearless. Relying on their unique strong formation, the players began to push back the monster army.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Great! We are starting to break through the enemy line!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They can’t focus their attack against us because of the zombies! We have to crush them right now! Charge!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players who were beheading the orcs and goblins came to encounter the zombies at some point. Thousands of zombies were in front of them now, which meant that they annihilated the monster army. But the players were faced with an indescribable dilemma when they looked at their bizarre looks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“These zombies are on our side, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They felt like they were compelled to use their weapons to attack the zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, they are probably controlled by the Necromancer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, is the Necromancer on our side?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players recalled the time when they swore at the Necromancer, though briefly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wasn’t it the One Heart Association that shifted the responsibility of the mainstream to the Necromancer and posted a message to the community, urging them to cut down the world tree?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m afraid the Necromancer might kill us because of that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way! I was cheering for the Necromancer from the beginning. I didn’t swear!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I know! It’s afterward. The damn dotards of the One Heart Association who posted such comments criticizing the Necromancer, not us! They didn’t even ask for our opinion.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they began to feel the overwhelming status of the Necromancer, they began to deny their long-standing association with the One Heart Association.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the zombies began to step back one by one. Thousands of them were split like the Red Sea, which Moses divided by stretching out his hand over it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Someone walked along the long road between them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is he the Necromancer?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, he was the Necromancer wearing a dark green robe. He looked at the players who came out of the fortress and opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our battle is not over yet. So, go back and repair the fortress.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, yes! Understood!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players of the One Heart Association followed his instruction obediently as if he was their supervisor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have no time to take a break! Immediately return to the fortress and repair all damages!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everybody, go back to the fortress!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the Necromancer turned right after saying that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wait a minute! Is he going back again?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? I hope not…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The commander of the One Heart Association could not hide his anxiety, so he chased the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wait a minute, Necromancer!” </div><h2 id="chapter263">Chapter 263</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            The moment the Necromancer arrived at the battlefield, the tide of the war was turned. So, the leader of the One Heart Association felt that the Necromancer’s presence itself could increase the morale of his players. He and his players wished this savior could stay.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I thought you would stay here with us. No?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer shook his head and said, “I’m going to the north.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? Oh, you have to stop the monsters from coming from North Korea, right? Can I ask you which area you are going to defend?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>But his answer was rather unexpected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is a war. You cannot win just by defending.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The message about the mainstream was that they should defend this land by confronting the large-scale monsters from North Korea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But he chose to attack the monsters rather than defending this land, which was clearly against the intention of the system.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo got information about the North Korean server through Victor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since Victor was one of the king monsters on the North Korean server, he provided Sungwoo with more reliable information than anybody else, such as the distribution of monsters within the North Korean server and the emperor-grade monster who controlled them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The emperor-grade monster is in Pyongyang. I have never seen that bastard’s face.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Have you never seen him before? Then, why did you serve him?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, there were lots of wild rumors about the guy. According to the rumors, he was originally a field boss monster, but he increased his worth by eating the raid boss monsters that were created afterward. If they didn’t obey him, he chased and ate them…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If he were a field boss monster, he was probably like the Korean server’s Bone Wyvern Alpha Male. In other words, he was a monster at the leadership level of the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If he had been left alone, he would certainly have grown endlessly…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Monster growth was not an event that took place in real-time. Like the King of the Great Mountain, who was created in Mt. Taebaek, such a phenomenon occurred only when there was no crackdown on the local monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, what kind of race does this emperor belong to?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the most important information.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“In the past, he was affiliated with ‘Elder Drake’. It was a smelly reptile.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had once confronted Drake during the Yeouido Raid. However, he was a young Drake in Sungwoo’s memory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How about now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He is associated with a feverish reptile now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you making fun of me now? You want to give me a quiz?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo frowned, Victor’s glaring eyes trembled out of fear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crackle! No, sir! He is Salamander!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Salamander?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>That name was also familiar to Sungwoo. The moment he put on the Hellfire Armor, he got the privilege of the ‘Salamander’s Aura’ that was triggered when his immunity exceeded 150%.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And in fantasy, a salamander is often described as a ‘fire spirit’, a lizard covered in flames.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Does he have the trait of flames?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes! I hear that he emits a fire hot enough to melt rock. He has a very nasty temper, so other king-grade monsters are reluctant to approach him.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, he’s a horrible guy. So you had better watch out for him…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, it looks like I can enjoy talking to him.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo led thousands of zombies and began to advance to the north.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, isn’t this too unexpected a situation? He clearly said he would hold out at the Imjin River. Why did he suddenly move to the north?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain was watching all the scenes through a crane. He even grasped the situation where Sungwoo’s undead army turned their direction and marched toward the north.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If that’s the case, what about his promise to appear at the critical moment for us?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, he takes care of anything cool by nature,” said Hanho when the king let out a sigh.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are his actions always this unpredictable?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu, Hanho, and the king were supposed to join Sungwoo a little later after taking care of other pending issues first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Sungwoo suddenly decided to advance to the north, which made them change their original plan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my… it looks like he is going to have a hard time fighting the monsters in the north…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Aren’t you supposed to move north and join him as soon as possible?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Jisu felt a bit annoyed because they could not do anything when Sungwoo was now advancing to the north.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Anyway he moved faster than we thought… Hey, have you boiled potatoes yet? Didn’t I tell you I needed some snacks before going deep into the mountain?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the king shouted in an angry tone, one of the tigers walked out of the kitchen hesitantly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, brother, I have run into a problem.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What happened?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tiger looked back at Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, Jisu, you said I needed to boil potatoes long enough, so I could poke them deep with a chopstick, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, that’s correct.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tiger looked embarrassed. Then, he gave him something. It was a potato.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Even though I didn’t boil them, I can poke them deep like this. So, can I eat it now? I’ve already taken a bite of it, but it doesn’t taste crispy at all. Is it because they are rotten or bad?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The raw potatoes he showed had five traces of chopsticks stuck deep into them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even if they weren’t ripe, these giants were so strong that they got poked deep enough when they slightly touched the potatoes with the chopsticks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Gosh! Get out of the way. Let me boil them,” said Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She felt it would be faster if she boiled them in person, so she rolled up her sleeves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the king sprang to his feet and flew into a rage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You punk! How dare you have your guest roll up her sleeves? How rude and stupid of you! When can I expect you guys to be useful to me?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tigers froze at the king’s angry scolding, but she stared at him instead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Be quiet. We have to get things done here and move quickly!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Did you just say it to me?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She had to leave right now, but the king put priority on eating potatoes, which made her so frustrated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come on! Don’t play the game of a king! Act like a king!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, I see. Hope I’m in your good hands, Jisu.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the king immediately bowed to her, nodding.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Act like a king…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When she entered the kitchen, the two tigers quickly followed. They glanced out of the kitchen and started flattering her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu! What you said just now was the most fantastic statement that I heard!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Act like a king instead of playing the game of a king! Yeah, you’re right!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Jisu stared at them angrily and said, “Excuse me? You’re blocking the sunlight. So, just go outside the kitchen.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yep.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I will do as instructed!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thousands of zombie corpses advanced to the territory of North Korea. Hundreds of crows were following them like a dark cloud, which spread from time to time in all directions and monitored everything around the area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Master! When you cross the hill, you’ll find a troop of trolls! They look like almost 100!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Victor has reported to Sungwoo about the tips he obtained through the crows’ eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt it was so convenient as if he had an aide-de-camp because of Victor who could control his undead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let the zombies bypass the trolls!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, master!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The maximum number of zombies that Victor and the Death Priests controlled reached 3,000, but they could not be resurrected, and they were no more than low-level zombies. In other words, they would suffer huge damages if they confronted the trolls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Because of that, Sungwoo changed the direction of his troops while advancing toward Pyongyang. He was thinking of preserving the troops as much as possible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo sent several large undead to clash with the trolls because they were an easy target. </div><h2 id="chapter264">Chapter 264</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “Wow! Oh, my God! You have shown the mighty power befitting the god of death! Crackle! Crackle!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching Sungwoo’s subordinate spirits smashing 100 trolls in an instant, Victor expressed excessive admiration.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shut up!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, yes! Crackle!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and Victor’s undead army pushed deep into the North Korean server and repeated combat and bypass while moving. When they encountered opponents they could fight, they smashed but avoided them if the fighting would be likely to take long.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Master, don’t you think our guys in the rear are going to be in danger?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Victor was right. That was why the expeditionary forces did not attack the capital immediately but smashed the castles on the outskirts first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo also knew that his forces would be exposed to the enemies’ attack if they pushed ahead recklessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, I know. But I have a plan for that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it. I trust you. Crackle!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While they were advancing deeper and further towards Pyongyang, a message rang.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Lich (Victor)’s ability slightly increases.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You can control a ‘small skeleton’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As an undead with excellent intelligence, Victor could see his ability increase by being next to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, master! I just wanted to let you know…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I know that already.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crackle!…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, a small skeleton was not a powerful undead. At best, he could resurrect goblins or Kobolds. However, in terms of the wide range of materials that could be used, Sungwoo could diversify the types of combat troops and make use of the lightness and agility of the skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If they can be upgraded to medium-sized skeletons, they are going to be a much more powerful force. An Orc skeleton unit with 3,000 soldiers?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Monster Lich had his strength like the player Lich mainly in terms of quantity rather than quality.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They kept advancing into the north for several hours.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Master! A huge army is approaching us from a place about 14km away.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, their long boring march was at an end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stopped his troops on the ridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Huge army? How many are they?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They’re a whopping 10,000 or more than that. Crackle! It looks like the emperor ordered them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If this was an army of more than 10,000, they were different from the defending troops along the borders.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘These troops have been dispatched from Pyongyang.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, the time he had been looking forward to came.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately summoned a Bone Wyvern. When he got on it, Victor tried to follow him, but Sungwoo stopped him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What are you going to do, master?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now we’re dividing our troops into two before moving on.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?” Victor was confused.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“From now on you are fighting them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You mean I am alone fighting them?” Victor asked as if he was embarrassed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“More precisely, just keep dragging it out while confronting them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What about you, master?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m going to move to Pyongyang.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was the reason why Sungwoo brought the thousands of zombies controlled by Victor deep into the North Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Make that guy called the emperor believe that I’m still staying here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, Sungwoo got on the Bone Wyvern and flew away with Victor looking at him blankly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crackle! Crackle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only the sound of him nervously bumping his teeth resonated over the desolate North Korean soil.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pyongyang was very different from the regions that Sungwoo’s troops went through. They could see some high-rise buildings in Pyongyang on the North Korean server, compared with lots of desolate regions. The tallest building among them “Ryugyong Hotel,” was a modern pyramid built by the North Korean dictator.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But now there was some mysterious noise coming out of that building. It was the sound of the rebar bending due to the unidentified heat rising from the basement under the center of the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nonetheless, the building did not collapse because of some magical power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Three players arrived at a place hundreds of meters away from Ryugyong Hotel. They were sweating even in the middle of winter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn, it’s hot even if I’m standing so far away from the hotel. Damn fire lizard…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Watch your mouth. He’s notorious for having a nasty temper. Don’t forget that we are the emperor’s emissaries.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They stared at Ryugyong Hotel with an unhappy glance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How can the guy claim to be the emperor when he is nothing but a monster? By the way, I wonder what kind of business our real emperor is going to do with him.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Using the enemies to fight against our enemies!”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As their conversation suggested, they were the envoys from the “China-1” server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After finding out that a large number of intelligent monsters were born on the destroyed North Korean server, they reached.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And what they expected was that the monsters on the North Korean server would destroy the potential enemy of the South Korean server, the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That butler is coming.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a Lizardman walked out from Ryugyong Hotel. He was dressed in a black suit and looked quite different from typical monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Lizardman bowed to them first, then said, “Our emperor has not yet woken up. So, I’m afraid you have to wait for a few more hours.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The three players were not familiar with this kind of monster who used such precise language.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We are envoys from the Chinese emperor. Haven’t we waited two days already? How can you treat us so poorly?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Moreover, the Necromancer is marching north, according to the Korean server. Is it okay for you guys to stand as onlookers like this?”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>They wondered if it would make sense for them to complain to the monster, but the Lizardman politely responded after listening to their complaint, “Please wait a little more. The Necromancer from the south can’t move up here. No matter how strong he is, he can’t deal with the 20,000 troops our emperor has dispatched.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? 20,000 troops?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Given the size of the troops, they were clearly in a different league. Although the Necromancer fought many times, he typically confronted an army of several thousand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s right. Since His Majesty stayed in bed longer than expected, he had his generals in charge of the troops when he dispatched them. As a result, we hear that the Necromancer has begun to go back to the south, driven out by our troops.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Lizardman in black suit fluttered his tongue after saying that. There was confidence in his eyes. They got rid of all the players on the North Korean server and gained enormous power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, they didn’t feel the Korean server players were a big threat to them, no matter how strong they were.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, that’s good to know. We just felt you were too complacent when the enemies were around the corner.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Chinese envoys, let me tell you something briefly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Lizardman explained to them arrogantly as if he wanted to teach them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Only one ‘Monster King’ appeared on the Korean server. But I hear they were nervous because they could not kill him. We have eight monster kings, and the one with the most overwhelming power is His Excellency, the emperor.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he finished talking, slowly bowing to them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You don’t have to worry at all. Even if he is the strongest on the South Korean server, our emperor is in a different league.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The faces of the Chinese players were still full of irritation because they couldn’t wait indefinitely, but they could not complain anymore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, we’ll wait a little longer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thanks, I’ll convey your message to the emperor.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, they turned around to wait a little longer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a small explosion was heard somewhere. All of them turned their heads to the explosion. The epicenter of the explosion was the skyscraper of Ryugyong Hotel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who the hell is that guy…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Someone was standing on the skyscraper.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He’s that bastard!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players on the Chinese server recognized him, holding a huge black sickle with his green robe fluttering.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Necromancer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the black scythe he was holding was seen swinging with a black wave.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It turned into opaque spheres and began to form on the blade of the sickle. They numbered about 50. </div><h2 id="chapter265">Chapter 265</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            The Necromancer jumped off the floor, swinging his scythe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fifty spheres hit the rooftop of Ryugyong Hotel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Goo-Ko-Ko-Ko-Ko-Ko-gung-<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The black spheres swelled, creating an unknown wave pressing down the hotel. Enormous energy and tremendous pressure struck down the hotel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Its steel frames, which had been deformed due to the heat, were bent randomly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kugugugugugu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>The huge skyscraper, where the monster’s emperor was asleep, collapsed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ryugyong Hotel collapsed like a sandcastle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Unbelievable! This can’t happen! Your Majesty! What a disaster!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Emperor’s aide, Lizardman, cried out loud. When the massive building collapsed, his bedroom was crushed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kugugugugugu-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The heat that filled the interior of Ryugyong Hotel got mixed with dust, creating a tremendous wind pressure as if a volcano erupted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Lizardman tried to approach the emperor, but he could not because of the enormous wind pressure blowing like a desert sandstorm.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Cough! Cough!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Such a terrible situation continued for several minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whoooo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>A little later the dust settled, and they began to see the devastated ruins of the disaster more clearly. The symbol of Pyongyang was smashed in an instant, showing the open sky after a long time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And a man exhaling blue heat stood tall beneath a huge gray mountain made of concrete fragments.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That guy is the Necromancer!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players of the China-1 server recognized the Necromancer. The Necromancer, who was reportedly retreating after advancing north, appeared right here in the center of Pyongyang.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if he was not just content with appearing here, he smashed the whole building of Ryugyong Hotel instantly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How could he appear here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It doesn’t matter. Even if we don’t ask the emperor, it looks like he is going to fight it out with the Necromancer. So, let’s get out of this place.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players on the Chinese server hurriedly stepped back. Since they came here as envoys, they didn’t have to fight a direct battle with the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They just wanted the monsters in Pyongyang to get rid of the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo, who was standing on the rubble of Ryugyong Hotel, was feeling some sort of energy coming up under his feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Yeah, this guy is still alive.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wearing Hellfire armor, Sungwoo felt it was like a stream of air, but given the nearby steel frame burning red, the heat was intense.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Other than me, nobody can stand this heat,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, I feel like my feet are melting,” said Minsok, next to him, complaining about his pain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They will come in droves to protect the emperor. So, stop them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Victor was dealing with the enemy’s main force to divert their attention, but there were still quite a few defending troops to protect the emperor in Pyongyang.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can you deal with him alone?” asked Minsok.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded at him and said, “I can deal with him because his biggest weapon can’t work any longer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The main weapon of Salamander, this giant lizard called the spirit of fire, was flames. However, his flame attack would not work against Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alright. Don’t worry about me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, Minsok pulled out a great sword he had lost. Maybe he would be able to completely prove his credentials today.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As expected, those guys are rushing to us in droves.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Minsok turned his head to one place, a large number of monsters were flocking along the empty streets of Pyongyang.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They are different from typical monsters.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although their main force was not here in Pyongyang, these Pyongyang defenders were pretty strong. Among them was ‘Drake.’ If they breathed out flames, dozens of zombies would melt away at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘But I can’t afford to pay attention to them.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kugugugugugugugu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>A tremendous vibration was already coming up from under his feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At last, the emperor came to his senses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, it looks like we’re going to collect lots of good bone material today, given their great builds. Let me go ahead first,” said Minsok, moving first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Purrrrrrrrrrr―<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Durahan followed him, and the undead army rose themselves behind the rubble.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And their shadows fell on the ground. They would not allow the enemies to approach Sungwoo and his allies here for at least an hour.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his gaze and looked down at his feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were still occasional explosions here and there. Somebody was coming up while throwing aside the debris.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quaguaguagua!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A beam of flames broke through the debris and soared into the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A long tunnel was opened from the basement when this stranger pushed out a massive chunk of concrete.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Which crazy bastard dared to come to my…?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A man walked out from there, shouting at Sungwoo at the top of his voice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How did he ruin my palace like this…?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His whole body was flaming hot. He looked like iron that was just out of the furnace.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He had long hair that dropped to his waist, and with his red eyes torn vertically, he was staring at Sungwoo ferociously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You must be responsible for messing up my place…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could feel intense anger in his eyes, but he just shrugged.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I thought you might feel hot inside, so I wanted to let some fresh air in your place, but things worked out like this before I knew it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I won’t ask who you are. I’m going to burn you to ashes and put them under my bed.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The field boss monster “Salamander” has appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was none other than Salamander, the emperor in Pyongyang. He was once affiliated with the Drake race, but after gaining extraordinary strength, he seemed to maintain his human form like the King of the Great Mountain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s nice to see you reticent. The king in my neighborhood is so talkative that he can be a headache sometimes.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo approached Salamander. Whenever he exhaled, heat flowed out of his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haaaaa… If that’s your will, you’ll regret it from the moment you get burned.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two flames, one red and the other blue, faced each other.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The mainstream was expected to end early, depending on the outcome of their fight here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jisu and Hanho stood in front of a cave, escorted by the King of the Great Mountain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is the place I mentioned.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is this?” asked Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain scratched his chin and said, “Well, what should I say? Should I say it’s like the veins of this mountain range? It is a place where the spirits of the mountains gather, and through this place, you can go anywhere from here to Mt. Paekdu Ridges in an instant.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mt. Paekdu Ridges referred to the mountain ridges ranging from Mt. Paekdu in the north to Mt. Jiri in the south.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, if I go through here, you mean I can teleport somewhere on the North Korean server and support Sungwoo, right?” Hanho asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, that’s right.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After he said that, the king walked ahead and went into the cave. The two tigers also followed him into the cave, carrying boiled potatoes on their backs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Hanho looked around the dark cave first and smacked his lips bitterly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, Sis’ Jisu. Isn’t it a tiger’s den? Are we going to get kidnapped and eaten by them?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No idea. Why are you worried about being eaten by the tigers who can’t boil potatoes properly?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You never know. They might be pretending to deceive us. Who knows they suddenly reveal their true colors and… Man… let’s go together!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>So Jisu and Hanho also went into the cave.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The inside of the cave was cold. And it was filled with deep darkness. It seemed like they couldn’t take even one step further.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the king lifted his index finger, and a small flame rose, which lit up brightly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me take out one, too,” said Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In no time, a blue flame rose from her shoulder. </div><h2 id="chapter266">Chapter 266</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            “Wow! Now, it’s bright around us. Sis, I’ve been curious about it. What the hell is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu put the flame flying over her shoulder on her palm.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, when I Ianded here alone in the mountain last time, I got this as a hidden quest. It’s called ‘goblin fire’, which is an item that belongs to its new user.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like the ‘Hellfire Armor’ used by Sungwoo, this item belonged to the new user once it’s used instead of being returned to its original owner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? How about the item’s effect?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It greatly enhances skills that radiate energy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Aha? That’s why you emitted numerous energy blasts from your sword. I know how thrilling it is because I can throw multiple daggers at a time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, it’s similar to that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as they finished chatting like that, they faced a steep downhill road. They couldn’t tell how long it was because the flickering lights could not reach far.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everyone, watch your step. It’s a steep downhill slope. By the way, you guys make sure you don’t drop the bags containing boiled potatoes,” said the king.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, sir!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The cave was very deep. And it was rough. There were few spaces for them to step on, and it was very slippery inside because of the moisture. Because of that, they had no choice but to be very alert while moving, which made them tire easily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, that’s why I brought the boiled potatoes because we need snacks on a long and hard journey like this. Don’t you appreciate my great vision?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king walked downhill, chewing potatoes. No one answered because what he said was nonsense.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At some point, however, the cave began to fill with light. A blue light was coming up from below.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re almost there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly, they saw the bottom of the cave and heard the gentle sound of water.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? Is it a lake?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Water was flowing at the bottom of the cave. It looked like a puddle created by accumulated groundwater and was the epicenter of the blue light. The water was emitting light.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The bottom of the cave was very mysterious. Not only was the lake shining in cobalt blue, but also the tree roots that came down from somewhere were scattered around the lake like a curtain. And between the roots, all kinds of items were entangled like fruit, which was quite eerie as if they fell in a strange country.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Gosh, what are all these items?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like a child who came to a museum, Hanho stopped by here and there, asking the king a lot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is also my treasure trove. I collected them while protecting the Great Mountain Range. You will find lots of useful things. If you need anything, just pick one.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? Are you giving us a gift? Are you sure?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, because we need weapons, not treasure now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After he said that, the king broke through the thick roots and pulled out something among them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. It’s been a while since I grabbed it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was an incredibly huge ax with a blue blade. It seemed to be the king’s weapon, but it was so big that humans could not handle it. The king lifted it easily and put it on his shoulder.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ax looked very unusual. Two blue dragons were engraved on its long handle. They bent up on the handle, carved in relief at the point they touched the blade while sticking out each of their heads on a single blade.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me see if there is anything flying…” said the king.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hanho wandered here and there then found something special.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a tree base between the thicket roots on which a pot was placed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What is this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the King of the Great Mountain stopped him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh no, you can’t have it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king was suddenly alert.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s alcohol.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alcohol? Oh, man!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho suddenly lost interest in it and turned, but only then did Jisu don an interesting expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Liquor? I wonder if it was…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s right. I made alcohol with the small crystals you brought me, Jisu.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo gave her the small crystals with the spirit of Mt. Taebaek.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This terrible alcohol is getting more and more fermented with the spirit of the mountain every day. Jisu, just pick one item you think will be useful to you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the king’s urging, she also began to look at the items. Then, a sword caught her eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, you know how to find a good item.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the King of the Great Mountains immediately pulled out the sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is the one you might want.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But I haven’t chosen yet.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, don’t hesitate to take it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He held out the sword to her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Ulfberht<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: One-handed sword<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Whenever you cut an enemy, your strength and agility temporarily increase by (+1). (Maximum +10) When you reach the maximum, you obtain the effect of the ‘Song of the Battle’ for 5 minutes. (You become immune to abnormal conditions, so you don’t feel any pain.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m sure this must be a good choice.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Did he advise her to choose it because he knew something about the item?<br/><br/><br/><br/>An unexpected message appeared before her eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have met certain conditions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* World Tree Resident (Special Identity) + Legendary grade Viking Sword (Warrior’s Mark) + Unknown (Additional Acquisition Required)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This one is…” Jisu showed surprise at that moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain smiled as he faced her wearing an embarrassed expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know what it is, but think about it slowly, not now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I got it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She knew that the King of the Great Mountain was looking farther than she thought, and he used it beneficially.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho picked up an iron helmet after hard thinking. It was an item called “Spirit of the Guard”, which had the effect of putting a shield on himself and one of his colleagues for a certain period of time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How can you match that plate helmet with your occupation as a thief?” Jisu asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She couldn’t hide her puzzled expression, but Hanho seemed pretty satisfied with the item.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Isn’t it cool? Hahaha! Since I already played the priest, rogue, and Asura ghost, let me play the tank this time!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When everybody was all set, the King of the Great Mountain walked into the lake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay, let’s go now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching him, Hanho hesitated then stepped back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, oh, my God, I wonder if you are not going under the water? I don’t know how to swim…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is not water. You can think of it as a kind of condensed energy created by the combined spirits of the mountains. I will open the door by casting a spell for space movement here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two tigers followed the king into the water. Then, Jisu went into the water, which forced Hanho to do so.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When everyone was soaked in the water, the king lifted his left hand and put it into his mouth, breathing out. Surprisingly, his breath materialized as a blue mist. And the moment he dropped it on the lake, it flashed blue before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘Mountain Trail’ opens.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have arrived at the ‘connected area (Mt. Duryu)’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And that was it. They were standing in an unfamiliar valley, which was the North Korean territory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck? Is it over already?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What did you expect?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, nothing. It’s good. I was afraid I might vomit, but I didn’t. Not bad! Let’s go and beat the monster boss. Wouldn’t it be better for us to go quickly before Sungwoo is done hunting all the monsters alone?” Hanho began to shout in excitement. </div><h2 id="chapter267">Chapter 267</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            In the meantime, the King of the Great Mountain approached Jisu.<br/><br/>“Ah, I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you this in advance…”<br/><br/>Having said it, the king took out a boiled potato from the bag the tiger was carrying.<br/><br/>“Actually, it’s not the monster emperor alone that we have to pay attention to.”<br/><br/>“What do you mean?”<br/><br/>Chewing the potato, he said, “World Eater.”<br/><br/>He mentioned that unexpected monster all of a sudden.<br/><br/>He continued, “I expect that monster will appear on the battlefield this time.”<br/><br/>The Salamander stretched his right hand to the side. At that moment, a flame arose from his wrist and burst out like a breath.<br/><br/>Quaguaguagua!<br/><br/>The concrete was engulfed in the flames, leaving a long trace of it as if it were overturning a sandy beach. And on top of it was a sword.<br/><br/>Cheejeeeeeeee-<br/><br/>As if it was made of magma, a reddish sword was stuck in the ground, releasing gray smoke.<br/><br/>Soon, the sword flew to his hand. It was a huge sword, at least two meters.<br/><br/>“Let me rip you apart before roasting every part of your body,” shouted the monster.<br/><br/>This time Sungwoo took out an unfamiliar weapon. It was the “Flail” he had obtained by killing the Red Rider during the battle in Pyongtaek.<br/><br/>Booooooong!<br/><br/>The Salamander charged at him. He aimed his sword at Sungwoo’s head, but Sungwoo avoided his attack by stepping back. His sword struck the concrete debris.<br/><br/>Thud! Puck!<br/><br/>The moment the sword hit the ground, flames soared from the front and melted everything nearby. Sungwoo threw himself to the side, leaving a large trajectory to escape the flames.<br/><br/>Sungwoo did so deliberately.<br/><br/>Booooooong!<br/><br/>The monster jumped off the ground. Because the iron mace was attached to the tip of the chain, Sungwoo could not block him, so he had no choice but to swing it in the same direction.<br/><br/>Clang! Clang!<br/><br/>They clashed only twice, but Sungwoo had to step back first. Although Sungwoo’s muscle strength was good enough, the Salamander was stronger than him.<br/><br/>Each time Sungwoo clashed with him, his flail flew back and returned, as if hitting a ball tied to a string.<br/><br/>‘Man, this monster’s so strong!’<br/><br/>Sungwoo found his hand torn and bleeding because of the enormous impact of the clash. But he had no intention of avoiding the monster’s attack.<br/><br/>Now, all he had to do was clash with the monster three more times.<br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/>‘Two more!’<br/><br/>Then, the monster struck the ground, firing a series of flames. Sungwoo pretended to barely avoid the flames by deliberately stepping back.<br/><br/>At that moment, the monster thrust at him with the sword, but before it touched his stomach, Sungwoo’s flail struck the top of the sword, blocking it.<br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/>It was Sungwoo’s turn to counterattack.<br/><br/>He turned the flail once quickly then lifted and struck his head hard. The monster defended by lifting the sword with tremendous resilience.<br/><br/>But, at that moment, Sungwoo’s flail turned into a purple chain and wrapped around the sword. The flail and the sword got entangled and fell on the ground. Then Sungwoo’s other weapons were dragged onto it like a magnet.<br/><br/>The Salamander looked down at his “sealed” weapon with a frustrated expression.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Fighter’s Shackles<br/><br/>-Class: Hero<br/><br/>-Category: Blunt object<br/><br/>-Effect: When you clash with the enemy 5 times, the ‘Shackles of the Fighter’ skill is activated. It ‘seals’ your own and the enemy’s weapons for 5 minutes.<br/><br/>“Do you like to fight bare-handed?”<br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/>When the monster was hesitant, embarrassed by Sungwoo’s unexpected question, Sungwoo kicked his knees.<br/><br/>“Kueeeeeeeeeeeh!”<br/><br/>While he was staggering, the monster swung his fists violently at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was not there. He appeared behind the monster in his shadow. Besides, his hands were already covered with a knuckle made of bones.<br/><br/>“Damn it! When did you do that?” the monster muttered, startled.<br/><br/>Sungwoo punched his side.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>Sungwoo punched him twice.<br/><br/>“Kheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!”<br/><br/>Because he was a monster that got the title of emperor, the durability of his body was enormous. However, since Sungwoo was also a player who gained the status of deity, his strike was devastating. While the monster was staggering, Sungwoo prepared another powerful strike.<br/><br/>-The ‘Twilight Raid’ has begun.<br/><br/>Sungwoo’s body was covered in black smoke in front of the monster.<br/><br/>Goooooooooo-<br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo charged at him right away, swallowing up his body, and throwing him down to the ground.<br/><br/>At the next moment, his body was shackled by 20 ghosts’ hands. Sungwoo stood tall right before him and threw his punches ruthlessly.<br/><br/>Punch! Punch! Punch! Punch!<br/><br/>Sungwoo punched him for only ten seconds, but his face was covered with wounds. He seemed to have suffered more damage than when he was trapped under the collapsed hotel.<br/><br/>Eventually, he helplessly collapsed.<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuk…You bastard! Ptui!”<br/><br/>Plunging to the ground, the Salamander spat blood.<br/><br/>“Who the hell are you?” asked the monster.<br/><br/>Sungwoo retorted scornfully, “Hey, you said you were not curious a little while ago, right? Did you change your mind?”<br/><br/>Incensed by Sungwoo’s insulting words, the monster raised his head. He glared at Sungwoo with a murderous look. He was not yet ready to give up fighting.<br/><br/>“So, what brought you here, bastard? What the hell do you want?”<br/><br/>“What I want is just one thing,” Sungwoo replied scornfully. “It’s your bones.”<br/><br/>The monster was startled while he was burning with a desire to kill Sungwoo.<br/><br/>The Salamander’s body began to expand. Then, as if a volcano erupted, an enormous amount of magma began to erupt from within his body.<br/><br/>Pusheeeeeeee!<br/><br/>Sungwoo pretended to step back as if he couldn’t overcome the intense heat.<br/><br/>The magma, which flowed like a liquid, soon formed a shape like a giant lizard made of clay.<br/><br/>-The field boss monster “Salamander” has appeared.<br/><br/>At that moment, a 30-meter magma lizard raised his head.<br/><br/>“Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr- Do you think you can strike me down with your punches?”<br/><br/>The Salamander, who had been maintaining human form until a moment ago, revealed its original appearance. What they commonly called “Page 2” began. The monster now got on his high horse as he wanted to use his full force to smash Sungwoo immediately.<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was not swayed by his terrifying movement.<br/><br/>Rather, he nodded, watching his terrible looks.<br/><br/>“Yeah, you’ve got the bones that I want!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>What Sungwoo wanted was not human bones. It was the huge bones inside that monster-like body.<br/><br/>“Good. You should have appeared like this from the beginning!”<br/><br/>“Grrrrrrrrrrrrr- It looks like you haven’t figured out who I am. This is what I look like. I’m different from when I wielded the sword in the form of a human body!”<br/><br/>Each time he opened his mouth, the magma dripped from his body. He kept huffing and puffing before opening his chin toward Sungwoo. A fireball was seen boiling in his throat.<br/><br/>It was Breath.<br/><br/>Fuhuahuahua!<br/><br/>Sungwoo threw himself to the side and avoided the column of fire he was emitting.<br/><br/>At the same time, he took a fan out of his pocket.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Bi Hyung’s fan<br/><br/>-Grade: Myth<br/><br/>-Category: Wand<br/><br/>-Effect: Increases magic immunity (+15%). You can control the soul of the dead (ghost). (Maximum 10) The ghost’s performance varies depending on the user’s ‘affinity for the tribute of death.’<br/><br/>-Description: It contains the spirit of ‘a man who controls the ghost.’<br/><br/>Finally, the time had come for Sungwoo to experiment with this newly acquired item. Sungwoo summoned some of his souls as ghosts. </div><h2 id="chapter268">Chapter 268</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Soon, a hazy shape began to arise nearby with a creepy cry.<br/><br/>-You can control ‘ghosts’. (Your affinity for death traits is the highest.)<br/><br/>* You are not affected by ‘physical attack’.<br/><br/>* You can ‘control’ all kinds of weapons.<br/><br/>* Inflicts the curse of ‘confusion’ on the target of your attack.<br/><br/>* You can possess targets below a certain level.<br/><br/>In the case of the undead, they could not approach Salamander because they would melt in the strong heat. However, it would be different if they were in the form of souls.<br/><br/>No matter how strong the flames, Salamanders would inflict little damage because the undead that transformed into souls had no physical shape.<br/><br/>In addition to this, Sungwoo summoned up to two “Specters” to maximize the synergy effect.<br/><br/>-You have received a ‘synergy effect’ due to team play.<br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Being without substance (3rd stage)<br/><br/>-Category: trait synergy<br/><br/>-Condition: 12 or more in the form of ‘soul’<br/><br/>-Effect: Moving speed increases (+30%),<br/><br/>As expected, Sungwoo could obtain only the 3rd stage effect by adding two Specters.<br/><br/>He then cast long spears and blunt weapons he made using bone weapon manufacturing skills all over the place. At that moment, the ghosts used their telekinetic power to lift the bone weapons. And some were interested in the items that were tied up in the ‘warrior’s shackles’. After 5 minutes, their seal was released. Among them was the magma sword used by the Salamander.<br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Lebatain (disabled)<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: Sword<br/><br/>-Effect: Increases muscle strength (+5), increases flame immunity (+10%), increases flame damage (+10%), and ‘flame waves’ when you hit the ground. (Cooldown: 1 minute)<br/><br/>-Description: It hasn’t burned completely yet. Additional conditions are required to demonstrate its full power.<br/><br/>“Man, you had some other good materials other than bones,” Sungwoo said scornfully.<br/><br/>Since it is a weapon with a fire trait, it would not have a great effect on the Salamander, but at least, it would be able to inflict physical damage.<br/><br/>“What the hell are you trying to trick me with? Whatever you do will be useless. I’m going to melt everything!”<br/><br/>The Salamander blew his nostrils and swung his tail, which alone caused a gust of wind and blew the surrounding debris like styrofoam.<br/><br/>Kugugugugugugugu!<br/><br/>His target was the group of ghosts floating in the air, but his thick tail only stirred the air.<br/><br/>Even after he swung his thick tail, the ghosts were still floating there. At best, his tail crushed the bone weapons that the ghosts lifted in the air.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>This time the ghosts moved around the Salamander. They flew around the Salamander like a swarm of bees, wielding the weapons lifted by their telekinesis.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>Long spears were stuck into the Salamander’s back and tail, followed by blunt weapons on his head. Even though such attacks didn’t inflict strong damage, they were still annoying to him.<br/><br/>“Kaaaaaaaaaaaah!”<br/><br/>Although he let out Breath in the air, shouting, it did nothing to repel the ghosts.<br/><br/>The ghosts hovered over the Salamander’s head to look for his soft spot then stabbed the spears one by one.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>“Argh! You dirty bugs!”<br/><br/>The Salamander kept wriggling, not knowing what to do about the ghosts’ random attack. But he found the solution to all his problems.<br/><br/>“Alright. It’s all over if I kill you!”<br/><br/>The Salamander cast his gaze on Sungwoo who was controlling the ghosts.<br/><br/>“Oh, you aren’t that stupid,” Sungwoo scorned.<br/><br/>Now, the Salamander ignored the horde of ghosts and began to rush at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Stepping back, Sungwoo fired the repeating crossbow.<br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/>However, the Salamander suffered little damage because the arrows couldn’t penetrate his thick hide.<br/><br/>He twisted his body and swung his tail at Sungwoo violently.<br/><br/>Thud! Kuggugu!<br/><br/>“Kuuuuuck!”<br/><br/>Although Sungwoo was not hit directly, concrete fragments flew like buckshot. Hit by the fragments, Sungwoo was pushed back. The Salamander then pushed his head toward him and opened his mouth as wide as possible. A fireball burst out of his throat.<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not escape it.<br/><br/>Noticing Sungwoo was on the defensive, the Salamander gathered all the magma boiling deep inside and threw it out all at once.<br/><br/>Puhuahwahwahwa-<br/><br/>The breath of fire swallowed Sungwoo. Although Sungwoo was hit by fire several times, the Salamander’s Breath was in a different league.<br/><br/>The steel frames nearby bent like malt, and concrete fragments melted like cheese.<br/><br/>At the same time, gray smoke soared, making the whole area dense with smoke like a haze.<br/><br/>Hwaahah-<br/><br/>All objects the flames touched lost their original shape.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the Salamander did not stop. He pulled out all the flames that had been stored deep in his body. Like heIl declared the other day, he was determined to burn Sungwoo into a handful of ashes and lay it on his bedside.<br/><br/>‘You are finished. You’re dead.’<br/><br/>At that moment, the flames Salamander emitted split into four.<br/><br/>The Salamander doubted his eyes.<br/><br/>‘What happened?’<br/><br/>Something was coming up from the bottom of the flames.<br/><br/>It was too late when the monster noticed something strange.<br/><br/>Breaking through the red flames, the blue flames climbed right up his neck.<br/><br/>It was the Necromancer. He was floating in the middle of the flames before the Salamander’s mouth, taking his Breath without any burns.<br/><br/>“Just don’t move your open mouth!”<br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo swung his huge black sickle. The black spheres formed there were fired all at once, flowing into his mouth.<br/><br/>Goooooooooogung!<br/><br/>A series of explosions occurred inside the Salamander’s body.<br/><br/>“Kheeeeeeeeeek!”<br/><br/>It wasn’t an ordinary explosion. It was Sungwoo’s skill that crushed everything in the area with enormous pressure.<br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo withdrew the Grim Reaper.<br/><br/>“Did you think I avoided your attack because your Breath was so hot?” Sungwoo snapped.<br/><br/>The Salamander struggled, with his stomach facing upwards. But he could do nothing, let alone scream.<br/><br/>“Don’t think that no one else can do what you can do!”<br/><br/>As if his body became a blender barrel, everything in his stomach was completely shredded.<br/><br/>“Kueeeeeeeh…”<br/><br/>Soon, his eyes rolled back.<br/><br/>-You have obtained 28,000,000 gold by hunting the field boss monster “Salamander”.<br/><br/>It was a perfect victory for Sungwoo.<br/><br/>‘Fortunately, this monster was completely smashed.’<br/><br/>However, Sungwoo would not have been sure of the victory if he had collided with the monster one on one. Fortunately, he could end the fight quickly by using deception.<br/><br/>-You have acquired the title of ‘Spirit Predator’.<br/><br/>* Fire immunity increases (+20%)<br/><br/>* Spirit dominance increases (+20%)<br/><br/>* Stamina increases (+2)<br/><br/>-You have acquired the title of ‘Emperor Killer’.<br/><br/>* All stats increase (+3)<br/><br/>* Damage to the boss monster increases (+10%)<br/><br/>Finally, another fight was over. And this meant the end of the mainstream itself, which terrified the entire Korean server.<br/><br/>-As of the current time, the mainstream ‘CHAPTER 4-1: Flooding of the Ruined World’ has ended.<br/><br/>* There will be an announcement of the next update in the future.<br/><br/>The Necromancer alone ended the mainstream.<br/><br/>When the boss monster collapsed like that, the rest of the remnants lost their will to fight.<br/><br/>The monsters who were trying to rescue the Salamander by breaking through the undead army began to run away, but the undead army persistently chased and slaughtered them.<br/><br/>However, that wasn’t all they had to take care of.<br/><br/>“Look for the spectators!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo noticed that a small number of players nearby had been watching the whole situation.<br/><br/>He couldn’t figure out who they were, so he needed to catch them and interrogate them about their intentions.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sungwoo looked at the Salamander’s body. Perhaps because of the trait of the spirit, his entire body was being vaporized and disappeared as soon as he was killed.<br/><br/>Fortunately, his bones remained intact.<br/><br/>‘There is something more here in his body.’<br/><br/>A round object rolled down his body.<br/><br/>Sungwoo picked it up. </div><h2 id="chapter269">Chapter 269</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/>-Name: Fire Spirit Stone (Advanced)<br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/>-Category: Manufacturing material<br/><br/>-Description: A magic stone that has a strong energy of fire.<br/><br/>“It seems to be better than the spirit of fire.”<br/><br/>He once obtained a similar item after killing the fire giant in Pyeongtaek.<br/><br/>He loaded it on the repeating crossbow to add the ‘ignition’ function.<br/><br/>Right at that moment, there was a violent vibration in the ground.<br/><br/>Googoogoooo-<br/><br/>“Vibration?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked around. However, no phenomenon could cause vibration anywhere.<br/><br/>Googoogoogoo-<br/><br/>At that moment, he suddenly looked down at his feet. Concrete debris trembled and rolled back and forth. The vibration was coming up from deep underground.<br/><br/>Sungwoo was familiar with this kind of vibration, something coming up steadily and very slowly from a very deep place underground.<br/><br/>The middle of the rubble piled up like a mountain began to sink because of a large hole under it.<br/><br/>‘Sinkhole?’<br/><br/>And black smoke was arising from that hole. The smoke spread widely and formed a huge veil. This was also familiar to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“No way…”<br/><br/>Soon, a huge eyeball popped out of the veil.<br/><br/>“World Eater!”<br/><br/>This unidentified being, who Sungwoo had once met in Daejeon, appeared once again.<br/><br/>-You are overwhelmed by the presence of the ‘external world.’<br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-60%)<br/><br/>His pupils now moved toward Sungwoo.<br/><br/>-The ‘unknown being’ is staring at you.<br/><br/>For some reason, the World Eater didn’t attack Sungwoo. Back then, he disappeared with the warning that he would kill Sungwoo someday.<br/><br/>‘Today is the very day he wants to attack me?’ Sujngwoo thought to himself.<br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately prepared for the monster’s attack, but he was not sure if he could effectively defend against the monster.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, he lost 60% of his stats. Besides, this monster brutally killed Dr. Yu, the head of the Evolution Society in Daejeon, in an instant. Given his terrifying force, Sungwoo felt he might be fighting this monster as he intended.<br/><br/>The next moment a series of messages appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Devil’s Gate’ has opened in the affected area.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Devil’s Gate’ has opened in the affected area.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Devil’s Gate’ has opened in the affected area.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Devil’s Gate’ has opened in the affected area.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Devil’s Gate’ has opened in the affected area.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Devil’s Gate’ has opened in the affected area.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Devil’s Gate’ has opened in the affected area.<br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Devil’s Gate’ has opened in the affected area.<br/><br/>“What the hell…”<br/><br/>At first, Sungwoo thought it was a system error. But when he turned his head and looked around carefully, he could see that it was happening.<br/><br/>Dozens of purple portals, dozens of “Devil’s Gate” were opening around Sungwoo.<br/><br/>Whoooooooooo-<br/><br/>Since they sucked in the wind and swelled, gusts blew from all sides irregularly.<br/><br/>‘Even if only one gate is opened, the whole area will be devastated. But ten gates are going to open all at once?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo could not block them at all.<br/><br/>‘I have to get out of here by all means.’<br/><br/>He gave up defeating the terrifying monster.<br/><br/>Did the World Eater also notice it?<br/><br/>-The affected area has been closed due to ‘unknown power’. (Pyongyang City)<br/><br/>To make matters worse, Sungwoo’s retreat was completely blocked. There was no way for him to run away.<br/><br/>‘How on earth can he shut down the area at will?’<br/><br/>After all, Sungwoo had no choice but to fight. He called back the undead army chasing the remaining monsters.<br/><br/>Kook- kook- kook-<br/><br/>It seemed as if the monster was sneering at him. The Devil’s Gates were expanding more and more. Based on Sungwoo’s experiences, it looked like hundreds of monsters would soon pour out of the gates.<br/><br/>Goooooooooooooooo-<br/><br/>The portal began to vibrate. Intense power flowed from the inside.<br/><br/>Kaaaak! Kaaaak! Kaaaaak!<br/><br/>A huge number of demons poured out like a burst of water. They fell from the air and hit the ground before raising themselves and charging at Sungwoo.<br/><br/>“Damn it! They are attacking me already?”<br/><br/>The undead army hadn’t arrived yet. Sungwoo raised his bone shield and repeating crossbow.<br/><br/>No matter how strong he was, he could not confront such a huge number of monsters alone. As things stood now, he was destined to perish.<br/><br/>However, at that moment, something huge, mixed with green and brown, fell right in front of the hordes of demons before Sungwoo. At first, Sungwoo thought a building collapsed.<br/><br/>Kueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh-<br/><br/>The monsters buried under the massive object groaned in pain. The object rose slowly again, and the shadow over his head felt like the feet of a giant dinosaur.<br/><br/>Upon closer inspection, it was the stem and root of a plant. More precisely, it was a bundle of roots. All kinds of thick roots were randomly entangled in the shape of a giant tentacle.<br/><br/>Quadddddddddddd-<br/><br/>Soon, roots soared from everywhere. They broke through from concrete floors, crumbled debris and building windows, then got entangled with each other and began to turn into something like heavy blunt weapons.<br/><br/>It looked as if an enormous octopus underground sent out its long tentacles out of the ground and wriggled.<br/><br/>“Good!”<br/><br/>Somewhere a clear voice was heard.<br/><br/>“You’ve done everything cool on your own, but it’s me who played a crucial role like this! I think you can understand my intervention, right?”<br/><br/>A black-haired man wearing a white scroll with a huge blue dragon ax in hand was sitting with his legs crossed on a bundle of roots. He was holding a long pipe in his left hand.<br/><br/>“Well, I’m going to play the king as well as the house owner today…”<br/><br/>He was none other than the King of the Great Mountain.<br/><br/>“Then, don’t you think I’m qualified enough to be your neighbor? Watch me beat them!”<br/><br/>The king slowly woke up. When he removed the pipe from his mouth and put it behind his back, a root wriggled and accepted it.<br/><br/>“I wish they could leave us alone, but…”<br/><br/>The king grabbed the blue dragon ax with both hands.<br/><br/>“If you guys really won’t leave me alone, what should I do? Let me try more!”<br/><br/>The next moment, the king lifted his ax while jumping off the ground.<br/><br/>He soared before falling down with the axe, striking down the target like lightning.<br/><br/>His target was the Giant Eyeball, World Eater.<br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain swung his ax and hit the Giant Eyeball right on the mark. More precisely, the ax was stuck in the shield around his eyeball. Cracks began to spread over the gray shield.<br/><br/>“How could you dare sneakily intrude into my territory with that nasty eyeball? You bastard voyeur!”<br/><br/>Having shouted at him, the king swung his ax again.<br/><br/>Clang–<br/><br/>As if thin plastic crumpled, his protective shield was torn apart by the king’s ax.<br/><br/>“Go back!”<br/><br/>Clang-<br/><br/>At last, the protective shield around his eyeball was ripped apart.<br/><br/>Kook! Kook! Kook!<br/><br/>The World Eater panicked and hid halfway in the veil. For some reason, it seemed he could not exert the power with which he brutally killed Dr. Yu.<br/><br/>At that moment, the King of the Great Mountain reached out his left hand. At the same time, a blue light erupted from his palm.<br/><br/>Oohoohooh!<br/><br/>That light pushed away the World Eater and forced it into the black veil.<br/><br/>-‘The power of the world’ has pushed out the ‘being of the external world.’<br/><br/>Then, the black waves that made up the veil disappeared as if it evaporated.<br/><br/>In other words, the king expelled the World Eater with an unknown force.<br/><br/>But it wasn’t the end.<br/><br/>Kaak! Kaak! Kaak!<br/><br/>Apart from the World Eater’s forced retreat, dozens of Demon’s Gates were still open.<br/><br/>Just like soldier ants pouring out of an ant den, a huge number of monsters were still crawling out.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle! </div><h2 id="chapter270">Chapter 270</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>While the King of the Great Mountain confronted the World Eater, the undead army under Sungwoo’s control arrived. Sungwoo immediately pitted them against the demons in a frontal counterattack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 500,000 gold by hunting ‘external beings (lower monsters)’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 500,000 gold by hunting ‘external beings (lower monsters)’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I have to block the entrance before more demons pop out. If demon gatekeepers appear in droves, I really can’t hunt them within the remaining time.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Waves’ existed in the Demons’ Den, where as the level of the wave went up, more powerful monsters appeared. In particular, the gatekeeper of the Demons’ Den that usually came out last was overwhelming.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, Sungwoo was much stronger than he was during the battle in Taiwan, but if dozens of terrible demons like the gatekeeper came crawling out, he would hardly win the fight. In the meantime, another reinforcement force arrived.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo! We’re here, too!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As Sungwoo turned his head, Hanho, Jisu, and two tigers came running out of an alley.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that strange helmet?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Strange? You don’t know anything about this helmet style!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho then shouted, tapping his heavy iron helmet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Isn’t the helmet the symbol of a warrior?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why do you think you are a warrior? Aren’t you a thief?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They could not afford to argue because of the impending situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho, don’t get too close to the demons. Just kill them from the rear!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do not worry! I have this helmet!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t talk nonsense! Let me deal with them in front!” Jisu shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since she had the experience of hunting monsters during the battle in Taiwan, she could confront them without any difficulty.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, she could easily smash one or two demons. Even if three demons charged at her at the same time, she could strike them down immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two demons were immediately beheaded when she swung her sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Surprisingly, Hanho was bravely fighting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahaha! Come on! Bring it on!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu thought it would be tough for him to deal with the demons, even though he was armed with the helmet, but he also had no problem confronting the charging demons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With an incredibly thick shield around his body, Hanho was throwing six daggers at them randomly. They couldn’t confront him, no matter how powerful and swift they came.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuck! Kuck! Kuck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The demons’ bellies were so ripped apart as to look like a beehive.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The first demon collapsed at Hanho’s feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, fifty thousand gold? What a jackpot!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While looking at the demon’s body, Hanho roared arrogantly like a street cat who won the territorial battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahaha! Look! I’m the holy Asura Rogue who can even be a tank! Bring it on!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, the two tigers under the King of the Great Mountain also brilliantly fought the demons. Since they were the king’s close bodyguards, they were far stronger than ordinary monsters like the demons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Both of them were holding giant hammers, and whenever they swung the hammers, the heads of the demons were shattered to pieces.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even while they were busy smashing the demons, they struggled to make sure they kept the potato bags safely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, protect the potato bag! Brother will be mad if you lose it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I know that, man! I am caring about it, too!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In addition, “root bundles” arising from all directions wriggled like snakes and fell on top of the demons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whenever the roots fell on them, they crushed dozens of demons at once, as if catching a swarm of insects.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come on, make the opening to the gate!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain swung the bundle of roots to clean the area around the Demons’ Gate. When they finally made the opening, they rushed toward the gate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have no chance of winning this fight if we just hold out! We have to shut the gate!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shouting like that, the king threw something at the portal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shhhhhhhhhh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a thin branch, which hit the center of the purple portal. Then, the portal began to crumble like thin plastic and lose shape.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘The Power of the World’ has forcibly closed the gate of the ‘Demons’ Den.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, it condensed into a single point and disappeared. It collapsed the portal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come on, take this!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king handed over some of the branches to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“These branches are full of the spirit of the mountain! If someone with the title of ‘Guardian’ uses these branches, he can shut the cracks in the world! To put it simply, the strong power of this world blocks the influence of the outside world!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Tell me who the hell you are!” Sungwoo said, curious about the king.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He knew the king was an unusual monster, but he never expected the king could not only expel the World Eater but knew how to shut down the gate of the Demons’ Den.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king looked quite different from the monster who received the title of “king”, as well as the Salamander, who was called the “emperor”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wouldn’t it be okay for us to sit down and talk after shutting the gates of our neighborhood?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king was right.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nodding at him, Sungwoo turned to the gate of the Demons’ Den.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Talk to you later,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No problem!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It didn’t take long to close all the gates of the Demons’ Den.<br/><br/><br/><br/>All they had to do was to break through the demons’ attack and throw a tree branch into the gate of the Demons’ Den.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The City of Pyongyang was quiet again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you all. Didn’t you feel it was like a scene in an epic where everybody fought hard in perfect harmony?” the king said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sitting on a large piece of concrete rubble, he began to peel the boiled potatoes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. This time it’s boiled very well. This slightly burnt part is particularly delicious.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He took a big bite of potato and looked at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can I ask my question now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did you know the situation was going to be like this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He nodded, chewing the potato.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I knew it to some extent. After I received the title of the King of the Great Mountain some time ago, I discovered through the spirit of the mountain that there was a creature gnawing on this land.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you talking about the World Eater?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king nodded and said, “Yes, their purpose is to take all the lives on this land. How crazy they are! They should have stayed put and lived on potatoes quietly. Why are they making such a fuss and sucking up others’ souls?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Anyway, I knew that you were hated by the World Eater, so I was on alert, closely checking if this monster would stick its ugly head out in the mainstream this time. Well, I should say his eyeball, not his head.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is the identity of that monster?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo asked, the king scratched his cheek and opened his mouth after hesitating a bit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, um, if I describe him roughly, I would say he is the god of another world.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“God? Is he the god of the Demons’ Den? He opened the gate of the Demons’ Den freely.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king shrugged and said, “Well, I don’t know where he is from, but I’m sure that he controls the Demons’ Den.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Earth wasn’t the only setting in this game. Not only the “Demons’ Den,” dominated by the World Eater but also the “Hell,” which seemed to be related to Kangsok Han, were two of the settings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And all of them were anxious to kill each other for no reason.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Anyway, to put it simply, one world is trying to devour another world. I would call it bad luck arranged by the system. However, since the system also wants a game that can pit the players of a certain level against each other, it has set up a certain rule that can serve as reins on them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Reins? Then, did you expel the World Eater under the rule?” </div><h2 id="chapter271">Chapter 271</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The king nodded. After eating the potatoes, he took a long pipe out of his pocket.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the tiger standing behind him put tobacco leaves inside the pipe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the king snapped his fingers, a blue flame floated in the air and landed on the tobacco leaves. The pipe was lit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whew… Our world also has a power comparable to the World Eater’s power. The so-called World Spirit can stop him from using his power.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, they must be desperate to get rid of the World Spirit, right? And that’s why they want to make everything in this world their subordinate like the Evolution Society.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, that’s correct.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As Jisu said, Dr. Yu, the head of the Evolution Society, had been serving the World Eater.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Because they cannot directly exert power, they first corrupt someone through minimal intervention, then control him like their minion. I think it’s their strategy, but I think there are several minions right now. Perhaps they might have intervened in the collapse of the North Korean server.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king’s gaze again turned to Sungwoo. Then, he pulled something out of his pocket and presented it to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You know what it is?” the king asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a dimly lit black stone with all sorts of symbols engraved on its surface.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Isn’t it a prophecy stone?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, it’s going to tell you about a guy of very high social status. You will be surprised a lot to hear it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo accepted the prophecy stone. Compared to the prophecy stones he confirmed until now, he felt it was somewhat heavy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have touched the prophecy stone (World Bad Ending-2).<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, a video began to play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Earth?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The first scene that unfolded was the Earth itself. As if looking down from the space station, he could see the whole Earth at a glance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Despite the destruction of the Earth, its appearance from space did not look much different. The part where the light did not reach was immersed in the colorless darkness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something was floating on the border of that darkness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What is that? A face?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a face. Like a mask, a face with only facial skin, but without a skull, floated in the orbit. It was impossible to identify its age or gender. It looked like a mannequin’s face, but it was ridiculously large. It was too big to be realistic. He was looking down at the Earth with a face that was only as large as the North American continent floating in the air. The Pacific Ocean was completely obscured by the shadow of the face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Its glaring eyes were full of greed. It started to open its mouth. Because it was so huge, it looked as if a super-sized hangar was opening.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘World’ loses its initiative.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘World Eater’ is coming down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With that message, the Earth’s rotation stopped. And behind the giant face, the moon that lost its balance was seen bouncing out of orbit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ooooooooooh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Changes also began to take place on Earth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Earthquakes broke out, clouds scattered, and the continents split. Red lines sprouted from all over. It was lava. Very small dots arose from the soil. At first, they looked just like dust, but when they gathered together, they began to be sucked into a huge mouth. Soon the screen was adjusted to show the expanded dust.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were humans.<br/><br/><br/><br/>All life on Earth was being sucked into the mouth of the huge face like a whale swallowing krills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was no way to resist it. When left neglected like that, the Earth gradually lost its light. And soon, it was split in all directions and met its final moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, the Earth and everything related to it disappeared into the dust of the universe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was an eternal end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-This is the future of the Earth that will happen if all the ‘World Spirits’ that exist all over the world are destroyed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The video ended there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the most terrible ending that Sungwoo had seen so far.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo slowly raised his head and looked at the King of the Great Mountain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How can we stop it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain sighed and looked up at the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s think upside down. If I were the World Eater, what would be the best way for me to destroy the world spirit?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king pointed to Sungwoo with the pipe, then continued, “Isn’t the best way just spreading an infectious disease, namely death? However, because you have grasped the reins of death in your hand, he could not achieve his goal contrary to his expectations. Good job.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the king said that, Sungwoo couldn’t help thinking of the Evolution Society. They studied death for a long time, arguing that it was the path of evolution.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘And the World Eater said that it should be one body, regarding it as transcendence….’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Evolution Society completely turned into the World Eater’s hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“And the second best way? I told you that the World Spirits were hidden all over the Earth, right? Then, what is the most powerful being that has taken root in this land and influences the world itself?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he asked that question, Sungwoo remembered the prophecy stone that Junghoon had shown him. According to the prophecy stone, the world tree that grew in Yeouido ended up sucking up the souls of the entire Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The world tree?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s right. Even that is growing well under your protection, right? Now, do you know roughly why the World Eater is trying to catch and kill you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king of the Great Mountain stood up, shaking off the cigarette ash from the pipe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As for the World Spirits, there are a total of three on the Korean server, and you have one of them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What about the other two?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know. However, the world tree that you are growing now may play the role of the world spirit someday.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo wondered if this was good news. It was good for him to keep it to the end, but the problem was monsters like the World Eater would continue to attack him endlessly to get rid of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So you have to keep it well. If the world tree grows well, it will serve as the strong defender of the world, but if it grows wrong, it will be like putting a stake in the heart of the world…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo knew what it meant. The trait of the world tree depends on the character of its owner. Therefore, if a wicked man kept it, he would bring about a huge disaster beyond imagination.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Minsok interrupted the conversation between Sungwoo and the king.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m sorry for interrupting you, but…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if he had something urgent, he was holding the “ownerless sword” in both hands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ve come to cut in because what I’m going to tell you is also very important.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at him as if he was expecting something. He nodded, so Minsok could talk.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s all over. I have filled in all the remaining numbers.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your ‘credentials certification’ has been completed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, the time has come.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo accepted the “ownerless sword” Minsok handed to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, came out the item information, which had changed considerably.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Ruler’s Sword<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Myth<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Two-handed sword<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Ignores strength (+10) and some of the defense effects of the attack target. (20%),<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: This sword is a key to awakening the black dragon and a symbol of a collar that can handle the dragon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You are the owner of this sword, and your actions will give it a ‘new name’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, the sword has a new owner, namely Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>More precisely, Sungwoo had been recognized as the sword’s owner in exactly 5,000 days.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, is the egg about to hatch soon?” Minsok asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nodding at him, Sungwoo pulled out an “unknown egg” from the bag. </div><h2 id="chapter272">Chapter 272</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Unknown Egg<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Class: Unknown<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: ‘Exclusive item for the ‘Dragon Knight (★★★★★)’<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Unknown<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: Don’t be disappointed by looking at the shell. If you protect this egg, the moment something breaks out of the shell, your destiny will change.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woooong- Woooong-<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, the egg was already responding. Just like a heartbeat, light vibrations were ringing at regular intervals. What felt like a cold stone disappeared and was now replaced with something that felt like a strong vitality.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘unknown egg’ will hatch soon. (47:59:59)<br/><br/><br/><br/>A dragon was supposed to hatch exactly in two days. Sungwoo had been expecting it for a long time, but he felt a bit embarrassed when he witnessed it right before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘When a dragon is born, what should I feed it?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dragons were far from ordinary pets such as dogs and cats. He could not ask around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Well, my occupation is not a dragon knight, so I don’t have any information about it because I got it by accident.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He didn’t get this dragon formally, so there was nothing like a manual.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While he was pondering over it, he suddenly recalled somebody.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Ah, Heyon’s advice might be helpful because she has experience raising a griffin.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a griffin rider, Heyon has been raising the griffin, Gust, the creature of an alien world, for a long time. So, he thought that she would be able to give him some good advice, although it might not be the exact solution.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, let’s go back to Suwon. By the way, how did you deal with the spectator?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Before he fought against the World Eater, Sungwoo ordered Minsok to chase the unknown players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, two of them ran away, but I captured another guy, but he passed out. I think I hit the back of his head too hard…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good job. Let’s deal with urgent matters first before we interrogate them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After saying goodbye to the King of the Great Mountain, Sungwoo and his party immediately headed to Suwon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was still time for the egg to hatch, so they needed to go back to their headquarters and take some rest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Large-scale construction was underway in the Suwon village. They were constructing the external walls and magic turrets, which they had planned a while ago.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you put them in the spaces marked on the floor, the captain will build the walls with his skills. Please stack them well so that they don’t get out of the compartment.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, move the brick material mixed with troll blood here! Over here, not there!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a massive civil engineering project with a large force led by Muyon, the “high architect.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muyon had “automatic construction” among his skills, but they had to move materials to a certain place manually.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Sungwoo visited Muyon first, who was in charge of the construction work.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It seems everything is going well,” Sungwoo said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, are you here? Thanks to large-scale supplies from Daejeon and Japan, our construction is well underway without any problem.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How long do you think it will take?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I think we’re going to finish the basic framework in one week. Of course, we need some more time to check the details after that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That wasn’t the only issue that occurred while Sungwoo was away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo approached the world tree, Kyongsu approached him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yesterday, a small group of survivors came to the village. There are about thirty people, but they are currently detained outside the invisible border. They said they knew you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They know me?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah. They are from Pyeongtaek.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Pyeongtaek, there was one group that Sungwoo met before. They fought with him when the Gate of Hell opened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think I know them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo visited a group of survivors waiting outside the invisible border. They were escorted by the World Tree camp, but they were not yet allowed to enter the invisible border.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah! Necromancer! Do you remember us?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, I do.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thank you. I’m sorry to have come like this. I’m afraid we’re causing inconveniences to you…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Not at all. Welcome.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Currently, the large construction required more manpower, and they had a clear background. Sungwoo decided to accept them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kyongsu, please take care of these people. I have something urgent.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo had no time to exchange formal greetings with them because he had to pay attention to the dragon’s egg right now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo took out the unknown egg in front of the world tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woong-Woong-Woong-<br/><br/><br/><br/>A faint heartbeat was heard from the egg. The egg would hatch in the next 43 hours.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If this is hatched, one of the conditions of the origin of the race, aka myth quest, will be met.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, more time was still needed to meet the remaining conditions, namely the “complete” stage of the world tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The world tree (stage 1 of maturity) is growing. (41%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The world tree was only in the first stage of maturity. It was not known how many stages of maturity it had, but it still seemed to need a lot of time to reach the completion of its maturity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Until then, let me focus on the dragon.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right now, Sungwoo couldn’t know if the baby dragon to be hatched would be helpful or would be an unexpected headache for him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Because I didn’t obtain it formally, I don’t know what kind of penalty there will be waiting for me. For example, the dragon might try to disobey or beat the owner…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, Sungwoo was ready to fully prepare for the worst scenario.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo called Heyon and asked her how to raise the dragon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He asked her about how to feed it first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Feeding?’ she asked, then scratched her cheek in embarrassment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, in the case of Gust, it’s predatory, so I used to grind meat to feed it when it was a baby. Since the dragon won’t need breastfeeding, I think you should do the same thing as I did.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, she continued after thinking about it a little more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, you might see a message that the dragon is full. That’s what happened to me. And…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She tried to think of other ideas as much as possible to be helpful to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah! One more thing! Although it’s a baby, it’s still the premier monster, so it might smash everything before its eyes.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Smashing?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That’s something Sungwoo had to worry about the most.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Griffin used smash floor paper, furniture, and other stuff in the house. Man, when I think about it, I still feel terrible. I’m afraid the dragon might be more violent. You had better not expect it to be docile.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m sure you’re right. I think I have to be ready for that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Am I right? Right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She was happy that her advice was helpful. Like she said, even if it was a baby, it was a dragon anyway. It could not only break household belongings but also harm the world tree. <br/><br/><br/><br/>So, he needed a separate facility to isolate the baby dragon from others. It would be sort of a cradle and fence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo asked Muyon to take some time to discuss this matter. Although he was busy constructing the castle wall, he had to make a nest for the baby dragon first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muyon seemed pretty embarrassed at his request.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, what kind of cradle should I make? I watched Heyon raising Gust right next to her. Man, Gust broke everything before his eyes…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muyon seemed just sick and tired of recalling it. Since Gust was a beast, it was obvious he had a very violent temper when he was a baby.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo said, “As you said, it’s a baby now, but it’s a dragon. So, I’m afraid it has a more violent temper. It can also grow quickly, so the space needs to be quite wide and very tight, so it can’t break out of it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muyon replied, “Besides, it should be built without presenting any risk to the baby dragon. I think I have to make it with materials that are not sharp if possible.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s right.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay, let me think a little more about it before making it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muyon hastily started drawing up the blueprint for the baby dragon den. </div><h2 id="chapter273">Chapter 273</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hanho’s mother, Eunhee, began preparing food for the baby dragon as the chief chef.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“When it’s born, its intestines are still weak, so I have to make soft food, so it can swallow easily.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eunhee was studying the menu with her fellow cooks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Hanho, who was overhearing her, tilted his head and asked, “Mom, it’s a dragon. Do you think its intestines are weak?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? What did you say? Dragon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Um… If this guy enters puberty and throws a tantrum, our whole village may be shaken. Yeah, it might be more terrible than Dad’s shaking the village with playing cards.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Other cooks grinned at his joke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eunhee slapped him on the back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ouch! What’s wrong?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh! What are you talking about? Just get out of here, son! You’re disturbing our cooking.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, it’s true! It’s a dragon! Ouch! Ouch!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She didn’t know it was a dragon, but she was thinking of preparing all kinds of food if she was not clear about the right menu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The kitchen staff was suddenly busy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next day, a ‘nest’ was made for the baby dragon. Muyon had an “automatic construction” function, so he could build it in one day as long as he had enough gold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The auto construction cost a total of 2 million gold,” he said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You didn’t spend much.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, I think so.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The nest was located in the west of the world tree, namely in the middle of Mt. Paldal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muyon thought it would be safer in the mountains than in a place with many buildings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Moreover, when it grows bigger, it will feel more comfortable to have a nest in the mountains.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good idea.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Muyon flattened the middle of the hillside and built a circular den on it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He used concrete mixed with ‘troll’s blood,’ which had the function of recovering some damage by itself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Kyongsu came up with several men carrying something on their backs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I thought you might need something to lay on the floor.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were a mattress, a blanket, and a cotton comforter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s take out the comforter. It’s going to break it anyway.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it. Oh, I brought something like this, too.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Branch of the world tree<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Myth<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Manufacturing material<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Just having it on your body gives you blessings. If used as a material, different effects are given depending on the degree of completion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: This is a branch of the world tree that has fallen naturally. Strong power is still embedded in it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Blessing Flower<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Category: Medicinal herb<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: When you eat it, your stamina and mana recover rapidly. In addition, all regeneration capabilities are improved for ten minutes. (50%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kyongsu added, “I’ve brought it because it can have a positive effect on it while it’s growing.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s a good idea. Let’s put them together in the den.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another day passed while they were busy preparing for the baby dragon’s hatching.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was D-Day finally. The egg was about to hatch anytime, but Sungwoo and other villagers were at the baby dragon’s nest in Mt. Paldal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, it could be dangerous, so except for the essential workers, please get out of the den!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the birth of the dragon was already the hot topic of the whole town, many villagers wanted to see it for themselves. However, it was never a sightseeing event, so Kyongsu controlled them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can’t we look at it from a distance?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you think this is an attraction? Just get out here quietly. It’s going to hatch right now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The onlookers were kicked out of the den.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sungwoo took out the egg and checked it again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘unknown egg’ will hatch soon. (00:01:48)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Less than two minutes were left now. In the center of the nest-building, there was a cradle with the branches of the world tree under it, so everyone except Sungwoo stepped back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It looks like we’re watching somebody taking care of an unexploded bomb…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a moment of tension for everybody.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whew… we’re not making any mistakes now, right? Hope an ancient cursed demon is not born.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho, please don’t talk about anything ominous!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo took the unknown egg out of his pocket and placed it on the cradle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wooooooooong-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Vibration grew so much that Sungwoo could see it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not only the heartbeat but also an unknown force was working. There was a big change going on inside the egg. It was the force that was pushing the shell away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It’s coming out.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could feel it coming out of the shell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the egg cracked then burst in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ouch!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The villagers stepped back further when the egg fragments splattered in all directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, a very small black creature crouched on the branch of the world tree where the egg was placed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is that a dragon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the size of a human’s palm. Aa a baby dragon, it was about the size of a puppy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Upon a close look, it had unique features, namely black scales shimmering like wet pebbles, golden eyes, and a smooth streamlined body. It looked like a very well-formed miniature.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, it slowly spread its toy-like wings and stretched.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh oh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s cute!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The baby dragon’s hatching was different from the general hatching, for it came out after bouncing off the shell surrounding its body like a grenade.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What a nasty temper!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt a bit worried, watching its hatching.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The baby dragon looked at Sungwoo who was closest to it, blinking its bright yellow eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that very moment, a message rang.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-A ‘noble creature’ has been born on the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The same message was displayed throughout the world. The birth of the dragon was a shocking event.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But more messages were appearing before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Black Dragon (Hatchling)’ learns magic through its owner.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Since it is a race with overwhelming magical talent, it’s most likely to obtain a high grade.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* In addition, it can create more powerful magic through instinctive application.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What the heck? Can it learn my magic?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Can he take it to mean that the baby dragon can become Lich someday?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could not think straight right now, so he just decided to approach the baby dragon first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The baby dragon showed interest in him. It raised its head and stretched its paws as if it wanted him to embrace it, but he did not approach it hastily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please bring me something to eat,” Sungwoo shouted to the cooks behind him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eunhee and the cooks brought pre-prepared baby food and laid it behind Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed as if they were serving a buffet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“First, give it a special formula first.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eunhee recommended the menu confidently. So, he served a plate of white soup to the dragon. But it flipped his head and struck the plate with his tail. Eunhee’s special milk powder fell upside down on the floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God! Look!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, it had a pretty nasty temper.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then how about this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo gave the next menu. It was a barbecued chicken. Its lean meat was very soft. He would never have recommended it to a human, but this was a baby reptile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sniffing- Sniffing-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not surprisingly, the baby dragon pushed his snout as if it liked it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, is it eating?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho’s guess was wrong. The baby wasn’t interested in food.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The dead will be the subordinate spirit of the Black Dragon (Hatchling).<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could not believe his eyes. He even thought he saw the wrong message.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But at that moment, the barbecued chicken raised itself. More precisely, the chicken bones raised themselves after removing its skin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my God! What the heck? Is this bone resurrection magic?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho’s absurd speculation was wrong again. It was just a skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the baby dragon flew over the chicken skeleton (?) it just resurrected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, it started rubbing its body as if playing. It swung its forefoot and chewed the chicken’s wing bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The chicken skeleton escaped from the dragon’s arms as if it was burdened, but the baby dragon chased after it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Perhaps this guy wanted a toy before food.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When everyone couldn’t say anything, stunned, Hanho opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, this guy acts like his dad. How terrible!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A dragon resembling the Necromancer was born. </div><h2 id="chapter274">Chapter 274</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The newborn dragon rolled on the ground with his subordinate spirit, the chicken skeleton, for several minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if he suddenly realized that he was hungry, the baby dragon put his snout into the baby food<br/><br/><br/><br/>he had just refused only a little while ago and started to eat it quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck! He’s eating it very well!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, he resurrected any food with bones as a skeleton. Did he do it instinctively?<br/><br/><br/><br/>By the time he finished the first meal in his life, chicken skeletons, crucian carp skeletons, etc. gathered around him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were awkwardly dancing together, which seemed to reflect the unknown spirit world of the baby dragon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck are they? Is it something like witchcraft?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I guess so. Very strange.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A dancing chicken skeleton? It was bizarre just like Sungwoo’s undead army but in a different sense.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/><br/><br/>After he finished eating, the baby dragon stretched comfortably then started to hop to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He waddled to Sungwoo as if he could not yet walk straight. Then, he raised his head and looked at Sungwoo’s face. His bright yellow eyes slowly blinked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why? What do you want?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He seemed to want something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrrng- Krrrrrrrrrrng-<br/><br/><br/><br/>But when Sungwoo didn’t respond, the baby dragon cried out sadly, it rubbed his head against Sungwoo’s ankle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, he is now recognizing his owner. But why is he crying?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He seems to want you to hug him.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since Sungwoo earned the ‘credentials’ by satisfying the 5,000 days, he naturally formed a master-servant relationship with the baby dragon even without building close ties with the baby dragon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, when Sungwoo touched him, his profile appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Creature Profile]<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Name: –<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Race: Black Dragon<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Hatchling (Level 1)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Owner: Sungwoo Yu (kor-157)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: Very healthy<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the black scales suggested, he was a “black dragon.” In general fantasy, a dragon’s available abilities were different depending on the color of their bodies, but this black dragon used Sungwoo’s skills by duplicating them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Man, he bothers me.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked down at the black dragon rather bitterly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crouching next to Sungwoo’s left foot, he yawned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I’ve got to treat him like raising a baby.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought getting a dragon would boost his power tremendously. And it seemed to be true to some extent because as soon as he was born, the baby dragon made a chicken and a crucian carp his subordinate spirits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo never expected that this naughty baby monster would follow him wherever he went.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, have you thought about naming him, Sungwoo?” Hanho asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Not really.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, don’t you think you are too careless? A cute monster looking like you is acting charming like that. How come you have never thought of getting him a name while you were meeting the credentials for 5,000 days?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then would you like to give him a name?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A hidden quest was given to Hanho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The boy dragon fell asleep under Sungwoo’s feet, so Sungwoo placed him in the cradle covered with the branches of the world tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He’s a really lovely guy,” said Heyon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She gently rubbed the forehead of the little monster sleeping on the cradle with her index finger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, Gust was really cute when he was a baby like him, but he grew up fast.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? I hope this guy can grow up quickly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But when he grows up fully, he’s going to give you another headache.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo made a puzzled expression, she continued, “If Gust grew up, he would fight on my behalf but that made me worried sometimes. I feel secure because of him, but at the same time, I’m always nervous.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As someone who controlled the undead, Sungwoo could not understand her feelings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m always worried Gust might be hurt, so please take good care of the dragon. He’s going to be your special family member.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even after she returned, Sungwoo was sitting beside the baby dragon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, he did not feel the same way as Heyon. He just hoped that the baby dragon could grow up fast and play his role.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since he was still a baby, he slept for quite some time. He woke up almost after 13 hours then began to bite the chicken skeleton again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>While watching the scene of him torturing the chicken skeleton, Sungwoo felt the chicken skeleton was struggling in pain. If the skeleton could speak, he might as well shout, ‘Just kill me!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Its wing bones were filled with holes because the baby dragon kept chewing them, but the skeleton was still in good shape, compared to the crucian skeleton. The crucian carp skeleton was already been cut into thirds, buried in one corner of the nest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kreee-<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, he became interested in something else. Seizing that moment, the chicken skeleton escaped from his tight grip and fled to the corner of the nest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kree- Kreeeeeee-<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What’s the matter?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>His pupils were enlarged. His gaze turned to the small window.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Window?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A mountain was seen outside the window. It seemed that the birds flying on the tree caught his attention, but he wasn’t just interested.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Dragon Fear’ has been triggered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* It stiffens creatures of low level and low intelligence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the sparrows hanging from the tree fell all of a sudden.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he tilted his head, not knowing what he just did. But Sungwoo was satisfied after watching the baby dragon’s remarkable performance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, he’s useful.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the first day of his birth, the baby dragon continued to show off his amazing skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The prisoner we brought from Pyongyang died.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Died?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok knocked him on the head hard enough to make him pass out but not die.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He detained the prisoner for interrogation after Sungwoo took care of the baby dragon but something unexpected like this happened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think he committed suicide. I’m not sure, but it looks like he ingested a poison hidden in his body. It seems that he took the extreme action to stop any intelligence leakage just like the spies from last time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it wasn’t a total failure.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo went to the jail, escorted by Kyongsu. Jisu and Hanho were already there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He looks Chinese when I checked his belongings.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me take a look.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo confirmed the prisoner’s body, and he infused mana into the cold body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Get up.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You can check the ‘memory fragments’ of the dead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, fragments of his memory appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Obviously, this guy had some important information.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the video played.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whoooooooooooooo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the middle of a barren snowy field.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Where is it? To say the least, this place is not on the Korean server.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Three men, including the owner of the memory fragments, were walking through the snow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, they entered the coniferous forest. It wasn’t a mountain but a forest on the plains.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, I never thought I would come to the middle of Siberia that I used to hear about. Damn it! What the heck are they doing here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo found out the location of this place after checking out the man’s complaint.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was Siberia.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The owner of the memory fragments replied, “They are hunters.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You mean hunting? What are they hunting?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Just anything.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a sense of awe in his answer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo realized that the most important element in his memory fragments was the ‘hunters.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, is the emperor going beyond the continent and trying to embrace these tribes in the periphery?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, the emperor has no time to care about them. He’s on the verge of unifying the whole continent by taking over Server 2…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Emperor? Sungwoo now discovered who they belonged to. These were the subordinates of the man who claimed to be the emperor of China-1 server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The owner of the memory fragments pulled a thermos from his waist. After quenching his thirst for a moment, he continued, “We have launched this operation at Gen. Singh’s order. The general instructed us to mobilize the barbarian tribes here to subdue the Korean server.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I see. He wants to use the enemies to kill our enemies, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, that’s why we want to go down to North Korea and negotiate with the Monster King who occupied it, as well as the hunters on the Russian server. Instead of fighting the Korean server by ourselves, we can mobilize them to smash the Korean server.”<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter275">Chapter 275</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sungwoo now grasped the whole picture of their operation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I predicted that someday the Chinese server would put more pressure on the Korean server…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, he did not know that they wanted to put pressure on by mobilizing other forces. In other words, they began a sort of diplomatic war with the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whooooooooo!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a blizzard began to hit suddenly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a huge gust. They had no choice but to bend down. A biting wind penetrated their clothes. There occurred a whiteout condition in an instant. They lost the sense of direction and perspective because everything surrounding them turned white.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my God! I can’t walk!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t move! If you move carelessly, you’ll get lost!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They did not move and looked ahead, covering their faces.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, huge shadows began to appear one by one beyond the white veil. The shadows swelled up at a tremendous rate. Something was coming to them from afar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the blizzard scattered everywhere in an instant as if nothing happened. And the identity of the shadow stood tall in front of their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“A bear?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were brown bears. Huge bears were standing tall like totem poles on the Siberian field. The blizzard stopped because the bears blocked the path of the wind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They are not Werebears. Are they the tiger race?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were too tall for the bear race in Sungwoo’s eyes. When they raised their upper bodies, they seemed to be as tall as a three-story apartment. It was natural that the blizzard stopped blowing when the five giant bears stood before them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And a giant man wearing a white fur hat appeared among them. His face was covered with grotesque tattoos.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Captain? That person is…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That person is the Siberian demon, Druid, the No. 1 in the Russian server rankings.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The owner of the memory fragments made eye contact with the man.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He made a frown, which suggested he was not pleased.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You guys smell so terrible,” Druid said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? What did you say…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The owner of the memory fragments felt insulted but bravely approached him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have come here to ask you a favor.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he explained to Druid the purpose of his visit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Druid smiled. The flush of his cheek meant he was drunk.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I know. Just tell me the amount of compensation and your goal. Then get lost! You smell bad!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The video ended at that point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is it over?” asked Hanho, popping up suddenly. “Oh, it’s over. Some guys are planning to attack us again this time, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Who are they this time?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are familiar to us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? Who is it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>China, Japan, and even Russia, the countries that aimed to occupy Korea from ancient times were planning to overtake it again. In some respects, this was something familiar to the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, the sudden end of the mainstream was as shocking as its sudden start.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The forces who tried to unite around the Necromancer had no choice but to disperse in frustration. They realized once again how pale they looked, compared with the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In that respect, the new mainstream was an event that confirmed the possibility that the Korean servers could be integrated into one, and who could be the central player of the integrated servers without any doubt.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the Liberation Guild was suffering from the aftereffects of the mainstream.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it!” Junghoon yelled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He struck the desk and stared straight ahead because of the message that appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The faction quest (special) has failed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, give me a break!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As someone who had a four-winged Angel statue, he was given a faction quest related to the just-ended mainstream when it was initially issued as follows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Faction Quest (Special)]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Title: Don’t repeat the mistake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Type: Assassination<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Goal: Assassinate kor-157<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Reward: Rank score<br/><br/><br/><br/>*The perished world is expected to reach the Korean server. And “kor-157,” the arrogant evil being, will appear in the chaos. At the decisive moment, betray kor-157 and get him killed by the monster army. This is an order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* If you fail to carry out this order, your ‘rank score’ will go down. (If accumulated, you may be excluded from the benefits of various factions.) In addition, the ‘all stats drop’ penalty is given to all the members of your faction (-1)<br/><br/><br/><br/>A similar faction quest was issued during the Korean and Japanese War, but Junghoon ignored the message and helped Sungwoo because he was convinced that was the right thing to do.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the Angel camp did not leave Junghoon alone or give up on him. Rather, they issued a more compelling faction quest, pressuring him and the Liberation Guild all the more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Wrong. I am wrong.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon chose the Angel camp because of their good image, but the price he paid for it was too harsh.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-A penalty is given to all members of your camp because of the failure of ‘Faction Quest (Special)’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-1)<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a punishment for Junghoon disobeying the order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can’t do it anymore! If you’re going to keep punishing us, just break the contract! Leave us alone!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Staring at the Angel statue, he yelled at the top of his voice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He always kept calm until now, but obviously, he could not stand it anymore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the Angel camp replied with another command.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-High-ranking players (players) of the Angel camp will be dispatched. Kill ‘kor-157’ by obeying them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* This is the last warning. If you fail to carry out this order, you will be “judged” accordingly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon sat down in the chair with a deep sigh.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, somebody knocked on the door. Minhum, his deputy, came in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Deputy, what’s up?” Junghoon asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whenever he came like this, he usually brought bad news.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, Minhum said in a nervous voice, with anxiety on his face, “Someone visited the northern border. They are from a foreign server. They look like Slavs.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Are they from the Russian server if they are Slavic?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon was not sure, but they were obviously the ‘high-ranking players’ specified in the Angel camp’s order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They have said they are from the Angel camp. They are asking me to bring the commander of our camp, saying they are the owner of the six-winged statue.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was exactly what Junghoo expected, but Minhum didn’t finish yet. He hardened his face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, when our guards tried to inspect them, one of them caused a blizzard, which blew up the entire northern border where 50 guards were stationed. According to our guards, they just blew it away by casting one spell.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon raised his head, astonished.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is that possible?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know, but…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blowing 50 guards away with one magic spell? Even the Korean server could not do it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are very powerful. I think we have to deal with him diplomatically, not by force. I think you had better go out and talk with them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon let out a sigh.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, if we don’t unite, we’re destined to be devoured by the foreign servers.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then. he stood up from his seat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please go and see Sungwoo.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? What are you talking about?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon approached the white armor hanging on the wall. And he looked down at the sword placed under it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“In order to deal with the bluffing guys diplomatically, we have to be as strong as them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a matter of fact, the Korean peninsula had been attacked by foreign countries several times historically.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fortunately, there was one strong sword in the Korean peninsula that could block them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘ I definitely need your help, Necromancer.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer was a lethal weapon or the best bargaining chip with which Junghoon could also stab the foreign players even if he got stabbed. </div><h2 id="chapter276">Chapter 276</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The next morning, an unwelcome visitor visited the World Tree camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? Who has visited here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While preparing breakfast after washing his face, Kyongsu sprang to his feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He heard that someone appeared at the invisible border and wanted to meet the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Upon hearing it, he declared an emergency and summoned all of the troops.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you sure the visitors are foreigners?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The chief of the 1st Guard Team nodded at his question.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes. They are a black man and a white woman. They said they came from the American server.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“America….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m going to have the ‘Iron Mace of Lightning’ ready for firing in case of contingencies. Like you instructed, our ‘watch squad’ is closely monitoring the area around the invisible border.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kyongsu greeted the guests outside the invisible border with a large number of guards on standby. The guests were only two. Like the chief guard said, there was one black man and a white woman.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I hear you are from the American server, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s right.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he asked, the tall black man nodded. Wearing a black suit, he looked like a wizard because he held a long wand in one hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The white woman standing next to him also wore a<br/><br/><br/><br/>1 suit and had a shield and sword on her back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“More precisely, we’re from the American-1 server. It covers the eastern area.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There seemed to be no hostility in their attitude. However, not knowing what kind of intention they had, Kyongsu was still on alert.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘American server? If so, it means that they have crossed the Pacific Ocean to come here. How and why?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Neighboring countries like China and Japan could mount an attack against Korea, but it would not be easy for the American server to attack Korea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even if they could, why would they bother to come all the way here by taking such an enormous risk?<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They must be very busy establishing their own power and constructing their community within their own server. Nonetheless, they must have some reason if they have come here from such a faraway place…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, Kyongsu mobilized a surveillance team to thoroughly monitor the whole area around the village.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The black man continued, “We landed on a nearby shore three days ago. We have already known about the amazing performance of the World Tree camp through the ‘World Message’ and ‘the Official Channel’ broadcasts, so we have come here to meet you and talk with you about lots of things.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The black man handed a cane to the white woman standing next to him and took a wallet out of his pocket. He took out a business card from the wallet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m Jonathan Cage, head of the 1st Foreign Affairs Team, belonging to the W·P·U, the strongest force of the American-1 server.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His organization was called Washington Players Union and Jonathan Cage’s title were printed on the business card.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kyongsu couldn’t hide his embarrassed expression because he didn’t even think he would exchange business cards with somebody in this situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I am the general affairs manager of the World Tree Camp.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nice to meet you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kyongsu held his huge hand. Jonathan made a nice smile then cut to the chase.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can I meet Necromancer by any chance?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, the purpose of their visit was to meet the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m sorry, but I can’t let you meet him now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is he not here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kyongsu shook his head and said, “He’s taking care of some important work inside. It looks like it will take some time. Can you wait until then? I’m sorry, but I don’t think I can escort you inside the invisible border because of security concerns.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, the Necromancer was not in the village at the moment. But he could not reveal it to these outside visitors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If these guys have come here for the purpose of aggression, they would not miss this moment when Sungwoo is not here.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan made eye contact with the white woman. The two nodded together as if they agreed on something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay. If so, we will be waiting for him nearby. Can I send you contact once every 12 hours?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure. By the way, what business has brought you here? Let me tip the Necromancer off in advance.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan’s answer was a bigger problem than he thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We would like to discuss with him about the need for an international unity organization to achieve reunification and peace in the ruined world. So, we would like to invite the hero of the Korean server with the greatest reputation in the world. We would like to discuss it with him.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I see. I understand your point. Let me convey your message.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>International unity organization? If so, is it like the United Nations before the world was ruined?<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Well, it’s not easy to build such an organization.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kyongsu was skeptical about such a grand scheme. As long as the system exists, how could it be possible? The system always wants a rough story. Therefore, it will nip the foundation stone for peace in the bud.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He also wondered if W·P·U, the strongest force of the American server, was really moving for peace. He could not take the black man’s words at face value. Rather it was most likely lip service.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It is still too early for them to cry out for peace.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Peace is the ideal they can think of when they have no problems at all. Otherwise, it is just politics or business.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘These guys are either predators or businessmen. They are being drawn to the world tree.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo was on a helicopter heading for Seoul. Early this morning, he accepted the Liberation Guild’s request for help.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They appeared around 8 pm yesterday.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum continued to brief Sungwoo inside the helicopter. He gave Sungwoo an overall briefing, but he kept emphasizing some important points again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“After a group of white players who appeared to be the Slavic tribe unilaterally slaughtered 50 guards at the northern border post in Eunpyeong-gu, they brazenly demanded negotiation with us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Negotiation?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, they were saying negotiation, but it’s clear they wanted to subdue us. But our Commander did not accept their request, and in the end….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum bit his lower lip and continued, “I heard that after he dispatched me to you, the Crusader Team led by him got frozen near Seoul Station after confronting them directly. I guess they were hit by massive freezing magic.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If they got frozen like that, are they alive or dead right now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t be sure of their death just because they were frozen because there were a lot of freezing-type skills that gave only ‘status abnormality’ to the target without damaging them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know yet. That’s why I’m so crazy. So, I contacted you right away to go there as soon as possible. I’m really sorry.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Minhum added, holding back his frustration, “Anyway, right after that, they planted in Mt. Namsan, but the temperature around Seoul has dropped significantly since then.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Temperature? Is a certain area getting colder?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes. The wide-area surveillance team couldn’t even confirm what it was. According to them, Mt. Namsan has completely changed like Everest, so none of them can approach it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After hearing the briefing, Sungwoo got a sense of who the unknown attackers were.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The Russian hunters are here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Siberian hunter or the No. 1 in the Russian server came to the Korean peninsula, instigated by the China-1 server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, it’s really cold suddenly, isn’t it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Hanho said, the temperature began to drop considerably after the Siberian hunter entered the sky over Seoul.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did you turn off the heater? It’s freezing!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Korean peninsula was also entering midwinter, but it was a much stronger cold wave.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“When we measured the temperature near Mt. Namsan, it dropped down to -25 degrees Celsius and is still going down. We don’t know how much it will go down.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God! 25 degrees below zero? This is crazy. It’s like Siberia, isn’t it? Ooops, my feet are getting cold…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“When you arrive at Yeongdeungpo Station, they will give you thick winter clothes and hot packs.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Groaning- Groaning-<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the black dragon next to Sungwoo whined. Even though he was sleeping on Sungwoo’s lap while hugging the chicken skeleton, he began to feel cold.<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter277">Chapter 277</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled out the “Fire Spirit Stone (Higher Level)” from his bag. It was a legendary grade item he obtained after hunting the Salamander. When he merely took it out, the inside of the helicopter got even warmer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hug this when you sleep.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if he understood Sungwoo’s words, the baby dragon rolled his body after putting the Fire Spirit Stone under his belly. Then, he moved the chicken skeleton to cover his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I’ve come to think of that dragon’s name, Sungwoo!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo asked Hanho to name the baby black dragon the other day. Hanho was writing something down in his notebook for some time last night. It seemed that he finally thought of one name for the dragon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How about Dark Fire?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could not believe his eyes because the dragon’s new name was ridiculous.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Not good enough? Well, I have another one because I know you are so picky. How about The Caesar of Korea? Isn’t it majestic and meaningful? Cai as the nickname? If you don’t like it, either, how about Chaos Empe…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Stop it! It’s my mistake to have asked you for it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Come to think of it, it was a mistake for Sungwoo to ask him such a favor because he was stupid enough to coin his nickname as something like the Strongest Holy Thief Asura.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How come you coined such a name? Hanho, didn’t you say you once raised a hamster before? What was his name?” Jisu asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It was Vladimir. Why?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? Hamster’s name was Vladimir?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho nodded with a happy smile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Isn’t it great? He gave birth to several babies, so I named them Volkov, Sergey, and Anastasia. Oh, I also raised a stag beetle, so I gave him the name Musashi Miyamoto, and I gave a beetle the name Kumgang Fire.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the moment when the law that beauty was subjective was broken.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, Jisu came up with one name.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How about Mir? In pure Korean, it means yong or a sort of dragon. Dragon is a little different from yong, but isn’t it cute and easy to call? I think it’s better than Vladimir…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sounds good. Let me take that name.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately adopted her suggestion. Then, Hanho got upset right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God! How insensitive you are! I stayed up last night, thinking about the baby dragon’s name! What’s the difference between Vladimir and Mir?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, none of them accepted his claim.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, the helicopter arrived at Yeongdeungpo Station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re landing soon!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Yeongdeungpo Station, looking down from above, was almost covered with pure white plastic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It hadn’t snowed. The water vapor in the air condensed and turned to frost. As a result, the roofs of buildings, the exterior walls, the asphalt roads, sidewalks, and various items were all covered with ice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know what those Siberian guys did to Seoul, but if we don’t do anything, isn’t the whole Korean Peninsula going to turn into another Siberia?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum nodded when Hanho spoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“All the people here are on the verge of freezing to death, but they can’t escape to other areas. The Siberian guys won’t let people escape without the Crusader Team defending them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If the Siberian hunters decided to hunt the people, they could annihilate the fleeing Liberation Guild members instantly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was why the magic of dealing with fire or ice was the most useful, but at the same time, the most destructive because it could destroy a wide area most efficiently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Is the Ice Age really coming?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho spoke jokingly, but it could be their real purpose.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Russian guys noticed that Sungwoo finally arrived. Even though Sungwoo and his party moved in secret, they got caught. And surprisingly, they made demands for negotiation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think they must have a hidden purpose. Their purpose is not the negotiation itself.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum was skeptical about the value of the negotiation because they made the demands for negotiation only after slaughtering 50 people in the first place. After that, the Crusaders Team was annihilated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Will you still go to the negotiating table?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, let me go and see them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Negotiating with them was not important to Sungwoo. He needed to check their movements at a close distance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It might be a trap, so let me deploy the maximum number of our Wide Area Surveillance Team around the negotiation place.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay. If we get a chance, we’ll be able to see whether the Crusader Team is still alive while they are distracted.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The negotiation place was Yongsan Station, almost halfway between Yeongdeungpo Station and Mt. Namsan. Sungwoo and his party moved to Yongsan Station at the scheduled time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Krrrrrrr- Krrrrrrrr-<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the problem was that the baby dragon, Mir, did not want to separate from Sungwoo. In the end, it was only after Jisu hugged and put him to sleep that Sungwoo could move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Before he wakes up, leave quickly. I will be waiting nearby with him. If you have a problem, let me run to you right away.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It would be most reassuring for him to have Jisu nearby because she has transcendental senses, but for now, it was important for her to keep Mir quiet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If they discover I have a baby dragon, they might intend to aim for it by all means.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It could be the worst scenario if Sungwoo had to fight them while defending that little and fragile baby dragon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Man, he’s really a nuisance!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Was it because he was just born? The baby dragon wouldn’t be separated from Sungwoo, which was a big headache. So, Sungwoo just hoped he could grow up quickly and be independent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s go.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo went to the meeting place with Hanho and Minhum. It was Yongsan Station Square.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hi. Come on.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were already waiting there. A woman wearing a white Shapka greeted Sungwoo’s party.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Behind her were several big guys here and there. They were sipping something with a sullen expression. It was Vodka.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They are Siberian hunters.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo felt at once that they were rough guys living in that cold area. Although the temperature dropped down to minus 28 degrees Celsius, some of them took off their jackets as if they were hot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Where is the boss?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo could not see the man he had seen in the memory fragments, Druid, the No. 1 in the Russian server rankings. However, the huge brown bear he was carrying with him was lying on one side of the square.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though the bear was lying on the floor, he looked as big as a bus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was distracted by the huge build of that bear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Man, that bone looks great. I covet that.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the woman wearing Shapka waved her hand at Sungwoo. Sungwoo looked at her with a frown.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, I can’t stand it anymore. What are you looking at so intensively when you have a beautiful lady in front of you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo was going to say, ‘I don’t need your bones!’, but stopped.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you in charge of this organization?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, I’m not.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With an irritated expression, she took out a cigarette and put it in her mouth,<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, she lit it and opened her mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I am Tatana, head of the Eastern Guild of the Siberian Hunters Guild. Our Tsar is still asleep after getting drunk.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tsar? Isn’t it a title referring to the emperor of the Russian Empire? Since he was the No. 1 player of the Russian server, he was given such a huge nickname.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The Chinese emperor or the Japanese sword master are all addicted to empty formalities.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>By the way, how come that guy is sleeping and drunk, in this situation? Sugnwoo was shocked by his arrogant and complacent attitude.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Or he might have set the trap for Sungwoo by tempting him to let down his guard. So, Sungwoo was on alert all the time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He immediately asked her because he didn’t want to drag on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, what do you want at the negotiation?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, you’re so impatient! I thought you might want to introduce yourself first… Well, it’s simple.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tatana took a long puff of the cigarette and opened her mouth, frowning her eyebrows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our client gave us 200 million gold in return for smashing your neck and the whole Korean server. So, this is a 200 million gold fight. Let me give you a question. How much do you think can stop the fight between us?” </div><h2 id="chapter278">Chapter 278</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Are you asking for gold?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, how much gold do you want?” Minhum asked. Since the Liberation Guild was already driven to a dead end, he asked it with the worst situation in mind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, you want to know our demands first? Great. But don’t be too surprised.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“300 million gold in return for our withdrawal, but if you want to get rid of our secret client, your potential adversary, you can add another 300 million gold to it. In other words, a total of 600 million gold. Do you have it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Liberation Guild didn’t have that much gold, and even if they had, they didn’t have any intention of agreeing to her offer, but Minhum was attracted to her offer in a different sense.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Then, it means they have at least 200 million gold right now?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Minhum quietly stepped back. Whether it was 300 million or 600 million, the Liberation Guild could not afford to secure that money.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Looking at your expressions, it looks like it’s difficult for us to strike a deal. Do any of you want to bargain with me?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>No one answered. Then, she got on her high horse, nodded with her arms folded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you don’t have money, just run away quickly. You still have time to run away until our Tsar wakes up. But, you should go as far as you can. Just cross the Pacific Ocean to go to America in search of your American dream.”‘<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment she finished talking, the cigarette she held with her index finger began to freeze.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, you could survive for a few more months.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blah blah-<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the ice floor began to spread from under her feet. The marble material froze in an instant, and sharp ice sprouted above it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Aren’t you running away? Then, I think I have no choice but to put up a few ice statues at this station.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Her eyes turned blue. At the same time, the temperature in the area quickly fell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo, Hanho, and Minhum felt their skin hurt because of the freezing cold, and the Russian men sitting behind her also began to fasten their collars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was at that moment they realized who froze the entire Crusader Team members.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum trembled in the biting cold, then instinctively stepped back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Sungwoo was different. He walked forward. His body began to be covered with black armor. It was “Hellfire Armor”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle- Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blue flames emanated from the black armor around his body. Then, the ice floor that approached his feet melted and slowly began to retreat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Water vapor exploded from everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, what the heck! Who are you? Aren’t you the Necromancer? Yeah, you’re right. But why are you giving off something hot like this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having fire immunity, and as a result, not feeling something hot meant that Sungwoo had so much heat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Furthermore, one more buff was added to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Fire Spirit Stone (Higher)’ causes a ‘special effect’ in response to your power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Temporarily increases fire immunity (+10%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Temporarily increases fire damage (+10%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whenever Sungwoo moved, all the surroundings around him began to be filled with water vapor. The Russian guys who tightened their collars behind the woman unzipped halfway again. Then, they put down the alcohol bottles and took out their weapons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching them, Sungwoo smiled at them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, let me offer you a little cheaper price.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Give me 200 million in return for your going back alive.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crazy bastard!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Aren’t you running away? Then, let me do something else instead of setting up a statue…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A huge black sickle appeared in Sungwoo’s right hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m going to erect your bones.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In no time, heat and cold collided, causing a vortex.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ooooooooh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The frost that had stuck to the surface of the floor and walls rose as water vapor, then became snow in the air and scattered everywhere. That phenomenon was repeating over and over again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tatana tried hard to cover Sungwoo and his party with the intense cold she exhaled but that didn’t happen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? This guy is a lot more annoying than I thought.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t start to throw a tantrum already!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, an army of the undead came out from behind Sungwoo. Hundreds of undead walked out of the black smoke. What really annoyed her was hundreds of undying troops.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But even faced with such an overwhelming force, the Siberian hunters weren’t scared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Look at that shit! Lots of cute guys appeared.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, Andrei, there’s one guy that resembles your wife.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“My wife will kill you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They started to warm up as if they encountered something interesting. They totaled 21, only one-tenth of the undead army, but they stepped forward confidently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s wipe them out before our Tsar wakes up!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure. If he wakes up, he’ll still be drunk and talking nonsense!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The undead army passed by Sungwoo and pushed into the square of Yongsan Station like waves to clash with them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Tatana waved her hand, an ice pick soared from the ground. The vanguard of the undead army shattered at once, and an ice barrier blocked their advance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the undead army did not stop. They climbed on a pile of broken bones and jumped over the ice barrier.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>An explosion occurred in the air, scattering bone fragments in all directions. It was a canon. One of the hunters was holding a barrel the size of his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh! Nice explosion!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just like their title ‘hunter’ suggested, they moved in tandem to find the best way to attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tatana stepped back then used freezing magic around Sungwoo. Even that magic made lots of undead skeletons unable to function properly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wizards and shooters in charge of firepower attacked the undead in the rear, and freezing magic exploded over their broken bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the bone fragments that should be recombined were coated with ice, it took a considerable time for them to be resurrected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The strategy of the hunters was quite unusual.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If they keep attacking us like this, we’ll have no choice but to be on the defensive.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lots of enemies chose the so-called ‘main target assassination” as the surest way to attack the Necromancer. Since they found it hard to endure the unilateral damage inflicted on them, they came up with such a strategy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it wasn’t easy to translate it into action. The moment the assassination failed, their strategy was supposed to fail, too.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alexey! Charge at him and hit back the bone fragments with a shield! Make it hard for him to come back!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The hunters’ strategy was quite different. Because each of their skills was outstanding, they chose a war of attrition. They decided to close in on the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first, a large number of the undead army were defending the Necromancer, but when they kept up with the freezing and fire attacks, those undead skeletons who became incapacitated increased. And they didn’t give the incapacitated undead any time to restore themselves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Khaaaaaaaaaaa!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A giant brown bear rushed with the giant warrior named Alexey and blew away the undead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each time the brown bear swung its paws, five or six undead were thrown dozens of meters away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Man, I mobilized the entire undead army to confront them, but they didn’t kill even one hunter! Each of them is pretty strong.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo moved back and forth between the undead and fired the repeating crossbow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, they blocked the arrows by rolling on the floor or lifting their shields. They had extraordinary senses. It seemed difficult to hit them with a weapon flying in a straight line.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If that’s the case…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo took out ‘Bi Hyung’s Fan’ and summoned ghosts. Ten ghosts appeared around him. -You can control ‘ghosts’. (Your affinity for death traits is the highest.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You are not affected by the opponent’s ‘physical attack’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You can ‘control’ all grades of weapons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*You can inflict a ‘confusion’ curse on the target of attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You can ‘infuse’ into the targets below a certain level.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Next, he summoned two more Specters to give them a ‘synergy effect’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their moving speed increased by 30% due to the effect of the . After sending them to confront the hunters, he also fired the repeating crossbow once again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! </div><h2 id="chapter279">Chapter 279</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sungwoo twisted the trajectory of the arrows with the telekinesis of the ghosts. Since the arrows were so fast, he could not control them as he wanted to, but he twisted them in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eventually, an arrow hit a hunter’s thigh.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh! Damn it! I was hit! It’s so hot! Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His pain doubled because of the firing effect of the arrow. The ice wizard standing next to him quickly dropped the heat temperature by using ice magic on his thigh.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahaha! Stupid Alexey was hit by an arrow for the first time! It’s that bastard’s turn to wash the dishes tomorrow!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, they could not afford to be complacent that long because ten arrows moved randomly and flew toward them from unexpected directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! That bastard is using a weird trick again!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Watch out, shooters! There is something like a ghost!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they were distracted by something else like this, it was natural that they could not focus on their main target.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, the undead monsters frozen in pieces began to recombine one by one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And that wasn’t the end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? What is that over there?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Watch out for the sky!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Massive objects were pouring down from the air. At that moment, Tatana raised her hand and made a giant ice umbrella. All of the hunters went under that protection of the umbrella.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quaguaguagua―<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of spears were stuck into the umbrella. It was the attack by fire arrow rocket. Sungwoo already installed the fire arrow rocket system on the nearby roof using the ‘Inventory’ function.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good! We blocked everything!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Tatana, you are awesome!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But their cheers didn’t last long.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens of arrows exploded and shattered the ice umbrella, scattering its debris over the heads of the hunters like hail.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn, I’m so confused!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The hunters slowly lost their composure. Then, they plunged into chaos.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Master! I’m here! Rattle!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>An unfamiliar voice was heard behind the hunters. Standing there was skeleton Lich, as expected. Following Lich were thousands of zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ooh! Ooh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck are all these zombies?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crazy, what the hell are they doing here? It’s more hellish than Siberia!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wake up! If you wake up, you can survive! Don’t forget we won’t die easily because we are supported by the power of the wild!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since Sungwoo could not bring all the zombies near the DMZ here, he canceled summoning them, then gathered all the corpses of the monsters on the Korean server. It took him quite a bit of time to do that, but they arrived before it was too late.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the hell is our scout Nikolai doing anyway? He didn’t even tip us off in advance!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nikolai! Respond! Nikolai!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nikolai, who was in charge of spying on the enemies, had been killed already.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu wasn’t just taking care of Mir. She was searching and killing spies like Nikolai.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They’re zombies! Wipe them out!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fire!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>More than ten zombies were killed after being hit by just one cannon. But no matter how strong their firepower was, they could not block the massive onslaught of the incoming zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get ready for the clash!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Start a hand-to-hand fight!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eventually, both sides engaged in a scuffle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Alright, it’s my turn.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Relying on the Specters’ eyes, Sungwoo looked down on the battlefield from the air. And he placed his subordinate spirits in the right place on the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He dispatched the Bone Salamander he had obtained from Pyongyang to confront Tatana, the most annoying opponent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the power inherent in the Bone Salamander came out in the form of a “Fire Spirit Stone (higher grade)”, he was still exhaling intense heat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Go away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The freezing magic that Tatana cast was scattered into the air in vain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Stepping back, she kept casting the freezing spell randomly. Of course, as the freezing magic continued to overlap, the Salamander’s body began to get more and more frost, but she could not do anything else because of him for some time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sungwoo assigned Minsok and Durahan the task of killing the brown bear who was destroying the undead army with overwhelming power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- Thump- Thump- Thump!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Riding on Bone Drake, Durahan rammed into the brown bear. Bone Drake was a little bigger than the brown bear, but the brown bear was stronger than the Drake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The brown bear grabbed Bone Drake’s chin with his relatively free paws and struck him to the ground. Bone Drake’s lower jaw was cracked open.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is that all of your skill?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the real striker was Minsok. He jumped off after stepping on Bone Drake and stabbed the ‘Ruler’s Sword’ into the brown bear’s neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The sword, which became much stronger after its name was changed, tore the bear’s tough fur and inflicted a fatal injury on him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In addition, Minsok showed his talent as a “death wizard” and cast a curse that made the brown bear’s wounds fester.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Doo Doo Doo Doo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Subsequently, a horde of zombies dispersed when the headless knight, Durahan, charged at the brown bear along with the rough clattering of hoofs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Choo-ooh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Durahan passed by the brown bear at tremendous speed, leaving a long stab on his side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he then turned around, frantically moving around the brown bear, continuing to increase the cuts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, Minsok struck him down with the sword while standing on his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok and Durahan kept attacking the brown bear ruthlessly, stabbing and cutting all over his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This huge bear could not endure their continued attack and slowly collapsed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 4,500,000 gold by hunting the Ancient Druid’s subordinate spirit (Ancient Giant Bear Stage 11)’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as the huge bear fell, Sungwoo resurrected him as a skeleton. With his skin and flesh removed, the giant bear as tall as a three-story building slowly raised his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Mr. Big was struck!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Run away, everybody!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching them, Sujngwoo felt greatly satisfied.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Finally, I got them.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He obtained the huge bear’s bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hanho was also engaged in the scuffle, too, but he didn’t do anything. More precisely, he could not find the chance to attack because numerous zombies were confronting the 21 Siberian hunters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Aho!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He often threw daggers from behind then sat on the bench as if he was out of breath.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, little boy!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Someone came to see him in person.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>One hunter, who was 2 meters 10 centimeters tall, approached him through a horde of zombies, wielding a battle-ax.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho quickly stood from his seat in embarrassment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he got upset after recalling he was called a little boy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? Little boy? Did you call me a little boy…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, I did. I can’t tell big from small as far as Asians are concerned. Anyway, adults and kids are all small, right? You are dead meat!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment he finished saying that, he swung at Hanho’s head with a battle-ax.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Hanho lifted his dagger to block it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang! Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>His opponent was mighty. Hanho barely blocked his attack by raising all four arms of Asura Cloak. He moved one of the six daggers that blocked the ax and aimed for the hunter’s neck. However, the hunter easily avoided it by bending back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, you know how to attack, little boy!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Huffing and puffing, Hanho corrected his posture.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shut up, fatty!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Hahaha! Little boy, you’re so cute! What’s your name? I am Vladimir.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho stopped at that moment then laughed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Vladimir?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you sure?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>For some reason, Hanho’s mouth twitched in spite of himself as if he was about to burst into laughter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yep, my name is Vladimir!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahaha! Oh, how funny!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eventually, he burst into hearty laughter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahaha! Vladimir! Vladimir! Hahaha!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Vladimir frowned at his unexpected scornful laughter. Then, he lifted the battle-ax.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? Why are you laughing at me like that, you idiot?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho stopped laughing, then sneered at him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Because my hamster’s name was Vladimir. Hahaha! Then, you have the same name as my hamster, right? Hahaha! You are such a big guy with the same name as my hamster, right? Hahaha!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Vladimir’s face turned red with anger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What did you say? What the hell are you talking about! This crazy bastard! Who is your hamster? If I smash your head, you can’t talk nonsense.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he charged at Hanho, pretty offended by Hanho’s mention that his name was the same as his pet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me smash your head!” </div><h2 id="chapter280">Chapter 280</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Vladmir threw the ax over Hanho’s head. Hanho blocked it with a dagger a little while ago, but this time, he couldn’t respond.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although Hanho was wearing an iron helmet, it would be crumpled like a piece of paper and his skull would be broken by the ax.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang―<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Vlamidir’s ax stopped in the air. To be precise, it was blocked by a golden shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, your IQ is the same as my hamster!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>While Vladimir was confused for a moment, Hanho stabbed his body with six daggers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Khuuuuuuuuuuuu…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“When I put my hamster in the transparent case, he used to keep scratching it, thinking there was nothing there. You are exactly a giant hamster!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shut up, you crazy bastard…Kuhhhhhhh.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Vladimir fell under Hanho’s feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m… Kuhhhhhhh… a warrior…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Goodbye, hamster.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The warrior who lived harshly in the Siberian fields during his life ended up being treated as a hamster in his last moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyway, the tide was turning in favor of Sungwoo and his party. Above all, Tatana could not move freely because of Bone Salamader’s blocking her during the battle, which played a big role in helping Sungwoo’s forces beat the Siberian hunters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I got him finally!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Bone Salamander was frozen due to Tatana’s continued freezing magic. She then sealed the monster with solid ice then turned her gaze away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, let’s strike back!” she shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the frozen salamander’s body collapsed, and a blue fireball ran through the gap.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Huuuuuuuung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>He threw the sickle at her neck, but she blocked it with the small shield, Buckler, in her hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She suffered huge damage with Buckler cut in half, but she could save her neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But she couldn’t block him from throwing his left punch.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Khuuuuuuuuuuuk!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His punch held tremendous power and knocked down her left cheekbone. Her body was thrown into the air before falling down on the ice ground then sliding along it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Gasp, gasp…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a painful groan, she struggled to raise herself desperately. Her cheekbone was smashed, and one of her eyes was completely closed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I thought I was going to kill you with one stroke, but you’re much stronger than I thought. It looks like you have good bones.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking down on her, Sungwoo spoke in a relaxed voice. It was a completely different situation from when she started the fight. She could not stand her shame.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it, I really can’t stand it. Wake up the tsar!” she shouted, raising her body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the hunters standing behind her looked embarrassed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Are you serious? He’s going to be insanely upset!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Turning to the man, she growled, “Anton. He is going to chew up half of us who have survived. Are you going to put up with his anger?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way! Sure, let me wake up the tsar before it’s too late!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They hurriedly changed their strategy. Sungwoo wondered why they were hesitant to wake up the guy called tsar, notorious for his nasty temper, in this emergency situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the next moment one side of the walls of Yongsan Station was thrown entirely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Is he awake already?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, four “Agency Giant Bears,” one of which Sungwoo just killed a little while ago, appeared. The Siberian hunters began to retreat to the side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kuuuuh! Ouch, my head…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A huge guy appeared staggering among the four Ancient Giant Bears. He was holding a bottle of vodka in his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He looked around, as if he still had a hangover, and looked at Tatana.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Tatana, I told me not to wake me up until the sunset, right? Can’t you remember it better than me who hasn’t sobered up yet?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But if we didn’t wake you up, we’re in big danger. Just look at my face, Tsar…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Your face has always been ugly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bad guy!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar guy threw a bottle of vodka at Tatana and stepped forward. And he faced Sungwoo now. While rubbing his eyes, he seemed to have come to his senses suddenly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, are you that dog of death that the Chinese guys talked about?”<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>He smiled brightly, spreading his arms. Then, he shook his index finger up and down toward Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Very nice! After treating you with formalin, let me put some nails in your joints and display you in front of my room. You’re going to be a perfect display!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo retorted with a scornful laugh, “Oh, I’ve thought the same thing about you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sunwgoo also scanned the tsar up and down and said, “By the way, you can’t be my match. Can you do something like transforming yourself?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck are you talking about?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Jisu shouted, “Hey, Sungwoo!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was some urgency in her voice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can’t find Mir…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mir? When Sungwoo turned around, he could not see Mir in her arms.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Mir came right under Sungwoo’s feet, more precisely his shadow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Mir has duplicated my shadow movement?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was stunned. Was Mir able to imitate all his skills?<br/><br/><br/><br/>But that wasn’t the problem at the moment. Sungwoo covered Mir’s body with his feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If that guy notices he’s a dragon, he’s going to aim for him mercilessly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Mir came out of from near his feet, walked around, then stared at the giant bears in front.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is that? Is it a cat or puppy?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrrrrng!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Mir started to growl at the bears, hundreds of times larger than him as if he was not scared at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Dragon Fear’ has been activated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* It stiffens the creatures of low level and intelligence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Surprisingly, his skill worked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The huge bears opened their mouths, along with convulsion in their huge muscles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were violently trembling in front of Mir.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar guy turned his head and looked at his subordinate spirits because he felt something strange about them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What’s the matter with you? Did you drink my vodka when I was sleeping?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Since the target’s level and stamina are high, ‘Dragon Fear’ has been applied only to a certain extent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All bodily functions fall into a ‘rigid condition’. (-60%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ancient Giant Bears were much stronger than this little dragon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Was it because of their low level and intelligence? Certainly, the baby dragon’s “Dragon Fear” skill was paying off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God…” Hanho said, giggling at the spectacular scene.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, these guys from Siberia are all like hamsters despite their huge build, aren’t they?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Today, Siberian hunters at Yongsan Station were being treated as hamsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Yong or dragon, the legendary animal, was described as the most powerful creature in both East and West.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrr! Grrrrrrrrr!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sometimes it was portrayed as being comparable to God, or even accepted as God himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the skill that the dragon can best reveal his dignity is the skill called ‘Dragon Fear’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? What’s the matter with you? Were you guys hit by that little creature?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the Tsar guessed, the Ancient Giant Bears were horrified.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dragon Fear means the fear that the target feels when they see the dragon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It is a fundamental fear that goes beyond ultra-low frequencies that can be felt by beasts such as tigers and lions. If a fragile creature faced it, of course, all of its muscles would be paralyzed, and in severe cases, it would die immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo thought, ‘Mir’s Dragon Fear is still weak, but it’s more than effective.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though he was still a hatchling, Mir, who was from an absolute race, made monsters that were hundreds of times larger than him, get cold feet, and shrink.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if they were ashamed to run away, the huge bears began to move their paws like pillars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump… Thump…<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, their movements were unusually sluggish. Furthermore, their legs were clearly seen trembling violently. Even though they overcame their mental fear, they could not help but tremble out of fear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud······<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since their muscles were judged “stiff” by the system, their “status abnormality” was bound to continue unless some appropriate measures were taken.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why are you idiots so slow?” The tsar shouted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if he was pretty offended by their funny movement, he stretched his hand behind his back. Then, Tatana handed over the bottle of vodka to him. He drank vodka hysterically, threw the bottle, and broke it. Then, he lifted his index finger and pointed at Mir, raging into anger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Trample that wiggling thing and kill him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrrrrr.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if he was surprised by his shouting, Mir clung to Sungwoo’s feet. Then, he stared at the tsar, growling at him. His red eyes flashed once. </div><h2 id="chapter281">Chapter 281</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>At that moment, a dark wave spread in all directions. It was mana. Mir used some sort of magic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And a message about the identity of the magic appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, it was Sungwoo who was most surprised.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! ‘Fellbalde’ begins in the affected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Fellblade?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Did Mir already learn the Empty Haven and Fellblade magic? And what the hell was he summoning?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although Sungwoo was the owner of this little dragon, he realized at the same time that Mir was unpredictable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And something beyond explanation happened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A relatively small black smoke arose, and a group of skeletons walked out of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Chicken?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>All of them were ‘chicken skeletons’, 14 in total. Sungwoo wondered where all the bones of the 14 barbecued chickens had gone, and Mir put and kept all of them in the Empty Haven.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck are you doing?” The guy named tsar shouted at Sungwoo. Did he think Sungwoo tricked him?<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Sungwoo shrugged and said casually, “No idea.” He was serious.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And things he could not understand kept going on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Black Dragon (Hatchling)’ has created a ‘new skill’ by applying the skill he inherited from you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What else?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Death Flames<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Skilled<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Active (ON/OFF)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Consumption: 5 mana per flame<br/><br/><br/><br/>*You can give ‘Death Flames’ to the undead under your command. This flame does not turn off easily and inflicts “flame” damage to the target it contacts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, a red light lit up inside the ribs of the chicken skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was flame. It rose from the part where the heart was located and covered the whole body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my God! Sungwoo, what the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s answer was the same again. “I don’t know.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He really didn’t know. All he could guess was that Mir created something ridiculous by combining Sungwoo’s “Salamander’s Aura” with the Necromancer’s skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That wasn’t all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Synergy effect’ is given due to team play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/><br/><br/>4) Harmony of Death (Hidden)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: job synergy<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: 3 or more ‘Lich’-level death magic users<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Upgrade to the ‘Ultimate’ level of the exclusive skill (1 random type)<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that Mir’s use of the undead reached the level of ‘Lich’, and as a result, Sungwoo was given a hidden synergy thanks to the presence of a total of three Liches in Sungwoo’s camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Ultimate level?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The skill of “Bone Weapon Manufacturing (Skilled)” is temporarily upgraded to “Bone Weapon Manufacturing (Ultimate)”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, there was a higher level than the ‘craftsman’ level. Sungwoo felt that the so-called “ultimate” level was the final stage, as the name suggested.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I’ve added only one dragon, but the possibilities for my skill utilization are endless.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo was amazed by such possibilities, Mir pushed his snout forward.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the burning chicken skeletons began to run in a waddle. Mir ordered them to advance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, they are fire chicken skeletons!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho shouted excitedly at their bizarre and ridiculous appearance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ‘Fire Chicken Skeleton’ squad named by Hanho stepped forward bravely and clashed with the Ancient Giant Bears. It was a really ridiculous scene.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the bears, whose bodies turned stiff, couldn’t catch the fire chicken skeletons running around under their feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, the fire chicken skeletons spread flames on their bodies while rubbing against fur.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheeeeeeee-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The flames began to spread from their legs to their waists and backs, plunging them into a panic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Lol! Let me show you how painful our attack is! Do you know fire chicken? Yeah, this is the essence of our cruel attack!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was an unbelievable scene.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that the tsar did not want to watch such an absurd scene. A shape like a giant bear appeared behind his back. It was attack magic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘That’s dangerous.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo hastily made a bone shield to cover Mir’s body. Right after that, the tsar swung his fist. Then, the creature looking like a bear behind his back swung his front paws.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kuwoooong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if sonic boom occurred, the air exploded and the bear’s paws flew in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the tsar’s target was none other than his subordinate spirits, Ancient Giant Bears.<br/><br/><br/><br/>All the brown bears collapsed with one stroke with their heads smashed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the fire chicken skeletons lingering around them were also shattered. Only one of them bounced off and fell before Mir.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching the chicken skeletons smashed to pieces, Mir became so excited that he was ready to counterattack the tsar at any moment, but Sungwoo stopped him right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar shook his wrist then stared at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It looks like you are mistaken. They are only my pets. They are different from skeletons.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he laughed scornfully at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I am different from you. You’ll come out and fight me, won’t you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar jumped off the ground to attack Sungwoo. At the same time, the Siberian hunters and the undead army moved again and clashed for the second time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stepped back, firing his repeating crossbow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the tsar did not avoid his attack. He wrapped his body with both arms. Then, the bear shape behind his back changed. This time it was a turtle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tong! Tong! Tong! Tong!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A green shield floated over its body, repelling all attacks. Perhaps because of the turtle’s traits, his moving speed was markedly slow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo threw Mir at her. She jumped quickly and received him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mir might flee from her arms using Shadow Movement skill, but Sungwoo could not afford to pay attention to it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After exactly 10 seconds, the tsar changed into another shape. This time it was a wolf shape.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You are at best prey! A little tough game!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar charged at Sungwoo at a tremendous speed then e changed into another shape.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time it was a tiger. He was thinking of running to Sungwoo like a wolf and stopping his windpipe like a tiger at once. When he swung his fist, the tiger shape struck the ground with his paws. His sharp claws tore the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo blocked the attack with a bone shield, but it hurt as if his arm was broken. Sungwoo’s body bounced off, crushing a bench as he hit the wall of Yongsan Station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It had been a while since Sungwoo was hit directly like that, but he was not groggy yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo raised himself and controlled the undead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Surround him!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar changed into a wolf shape and charged at Sungwoo. However, Sungwoo’s undead were also fast. Those who could move fast gathered around the tsar immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get out of here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar swung his hands violently. Huge claws scratched the area around him, and the ghouls aiming at the tsar’s neck were smashed to pieces. However, that little moment was more than enough for Sungwoo to prepare for the next attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whooooooooong-<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo swung the Grim Reaper, ten black spheres were fired. It was “Evil Spirit Bombing”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the tsar did not avoid his attack again this time. When he wrapped his body with both arms again, and a turtle shape appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gu-gu-gu-gung-<br/><br/><br/><br/>A black sway flew through the shield, scattering behind the tsar’s back. He made a scornful smile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching it, Sungwoo thought, ‘Man, this guy’s defense power is tremendous. If the ‘Evil Spirit Bombing’ didn’t work, I can’t beat him by mobilizing simple firepower alone.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ten seconds later, the tsar became a wolf shape and ran at Sungwoo fiercely. But Sungwoo kept stepping back, throwing the undead at him. He also placed some undead on the retreat route to prevent the tsar from chasing him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey! How long are you going to play with me?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar stopped chasing then opened his arms toward Sungwoo provocatively.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Aren’t you a strong player who fought against and beat the Angel and Demon camps? Was it all a fake?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, let’s fight a one-on-one match!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar smashed a skull, showing a desperate wish to fight him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you are a real man, you have to show your own strength. Asian men aren’t even as strong as women…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He kept talking to Sungwoo with provocative words, but the latter lifted the repeating crossbow without replying to him. Then, he fired an arrow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar turned his head to avoid the arrow, but its tip got caught on the fur hat, sending it far away. A vein was seen on his forehead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Yeah, I’m interested in your response anyway!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He raised his right hand in violent excitement. The tattoo on the back of his hand began to glow black.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! A ‘Demon Beast’ has been summoned in the area. </div><h2 id="chapter282">Chapter 282</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Something started to happen. However, there wasn’t much that Sungwoo could guess from the message alone. Given the meaning of the word, it looked like a demonic beast came out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But, it’s Demon Beast!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time the hunter became nervous.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Tsar has used the power of a hell pilgrim!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it. Hide wherever you can!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The hunters who were confronting the undead army widened their distance from the tsar. Sungwoo also stepped back, feeling something ominous.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a black crack broke out over the tsar’s shoulder. Then, two small portals opened on the spot, and black lumps flowed out and fell. There were about 20 in total.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Krrrrrrrrkur―<br/><br/><br/><br/>They wriggled and started to take on form, something with four legs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were animals, but they could never be seen on Earth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The monsters with two heads and six eyes raised themselves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘That’s why he was called the Devil’s Druid.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>They called him ‘Devil’s Druid’ in the memory fragments of Chinese server players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could not understand it back then, but he now did.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This guy chose a high-ranking druid, Ancient Druid, as his primary job, and one that could control the hellish monster as his minor job.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two were linked together to deal with the beast of hell, the “Demon Beast.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, that wasn’t the end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Body functions are weakened due to unknown energy. (They are affected by a stronger wave because of the clash of two energies.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All stats decrease. (-5)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The above message appeared before everyone except Sungwoo and the tsar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, the tsar also turned into an unknown “deity’ status.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s now more fun, isn’t it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the “Demon Beast” completed his shape and moved.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh–<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was as fast as an arrow. He transformed his body freely and pierced the undead between Sujngwoo and the tsar like a drill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The skeletons guarding Sungwoo collapsed all of a sudden.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What do you think? Is he a little better than your undead?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The demon beasts spread in all directions and formed a siege around Sungwoo then charged at him all at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately hung on the claws of one of Bone Wyverns. In order to avoid the demon beasts closing in on him, he had no choice but to soar into the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaaaaaaaaaaak!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, he couldn’t escape them. Two of the demon beasts stepped on the rooftop of Yongsan Station then collided with Bone Wyvern, broke his ribs, and penetrated his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the two bounced back and forth inside, thoroughly disassembling Bone Wyvern. Sungwoo hurriedly fled from Bone Wyvern and hung on the back of the zombie bird.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I can’t let this fight drag on like this. I need to kill them with one fatal strike.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>While he was on alert, Sungwoo pondered over how to attack the tsar. He remembered one thing he had forgotten. It was the Bone Weapon Manufacturing (ultimate) skill he obtained through synergy effects. He was so absent-minded with the fight that he could not check it out in such a hectic situation, but he thought it would give him a way out. Now, was the time he needed a game maker.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo checked the skill information while giving the demon beasts the slip.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Bone Weapon Manufacturing<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Ultimate<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Active<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Consumption: 5~100 Mana<br/><br/><br/><br/>*You can make a weapon using the bones of the corpse. Currently, the types of weapons that you can make are as follows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(1) Common weapon<br/><br/><br/><br/>(2) Advanced technical equipment<br/><br/><br/><br/>(3) Flying weapon<br/><br/><br/><br/>(4) Free molding.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*The final products vary depending on the type and quality of the material, and the higher your skill level, the more sophisticated you can make the weapons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Based on the information, the Bone Weapon Manufacturing (Skilled) skill Sungwoo originally possessed was only capable of making general weapons. But as he improved his skills in the future, he would be able to manufacture more sophisticated weapons endlessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘No. 3 flying weapons are amazing. But what is this No. 4 free molding? Does it mean I can mold them freely?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>To be honest, Sungwoo didn’t know how far that limit would be. However, as it was the “ultimate” stage, it would not be a mediocre weapon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How long are you going to run away? Huh? Since you guys are so weak like this, your people suffered so much in the past!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ignoring the tsar’s sarcastic remarks, Sungwoo pulled the repeating crossbow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s useless!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, the tsar turned into a turtle shape after folding his arms then charged at him from the front.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It’s only 10 seconds.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stepped back and the tsar kicked the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo counted the numbers deep down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘5 seconds 4 seconds, 3 seconds…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>A tiger shape emerged behind the tsar’s back at the last second.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Right, this guy can’t change into a turtle shape for another 10 seconds.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo found out that the tsar could not change into another shape for ten seconds once it became a certain shape. So, this moment was a good opportunity for Sungwo to strike him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stretched out his hand into the air then cast the magic with a small voice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Manufacture bone weapons!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, a group of Bone Wyverns flying all over the sky stopped flapping their wings. Mana came out of their bodies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, their huge white bodies shattered and poured down. They were rain made of bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The whole world was covered with pure white bones and black shadows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ooh ooh ooh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Before long, they began to swirl in the air and merge into a single stem. Soon, some form was completed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a giant’s legs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The giant’s huge feet fell over the tsar’s head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kwa-ang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment he stepped, a tremendous shock shook the whole area. It was as if a ancient giant was resurrected to end the civilization of mankind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ground where the tsar was standing collapsed, the pipes broke, and water soared. Buildings in the area were staggering and windows broke. Abandoned cars on the roads sank under the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it wasn’t over yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Manufacture bone weapons!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then all kinds of bone fragments, including the giant corpses of brown bears scattered on the ground, began to unite into a single place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kugugugugugugu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time it was the hand of a giant. As soon as the giant lifted his feet, a huge palm fell over it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, a tremendous shock swept through downtown. The giant clenched his fist slowly. More precisely, he grabbed something under his palm.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the tsar. Covered with blood from only two strokes, the tsar raised his head painfully.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kheeeeeeek! Shit!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it wasn’t the end. The tsar found something and raised his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were a dozen “bone ballista” made of bones behind Sungwoo’s back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Before you die, show off all your power, you tough guy!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The way Sungwoo dealt with a racist like the tsar was to make him feel keenly that no humans were superior to each other.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Ultimate Bone Weapon manufacturing was materialized beyond common sense. Hundreds of undead were merged into one to form the arms and legs of the giant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar groaned, twisting his body. Even the “demon druid” who exerted superhuman power could not escape the grasp of the giant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He realized that he could not escape with his own power, so he belatedly moved the ‘Demon Beast’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Come here! Bite off this one!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The demon beasts could have broken the giant’s arms and escaped, but Sungwoo was faster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Fire!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as Sungwoo ordered, the skeletons standing behind the ‘Bone Ballista’ activated the huge flying weapons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, spears made of bones were shot like bullets. It was 14 in total. They were fired off from the giant’s hands and hit the one target, which was the tsar’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the tsar was intact, for at that moment a bear shape behind his back swung its paws and struck the flying spear. He was quite an adroit fighter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only one spear passed through his side, but that alone couldn’t defeat him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I have to give him another blow before he recovers.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo raised his head. However, the giant’s feet were already tattered by the attacks of the horde of demon beasts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo succeeded in striking the tsar by a surprise attack, but if Sunwoo could try to manufacture bone weapons again, the tsar would block him after noticing it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I need extra undead!’ </div><h2 id="chapter283">Chapter 283</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>While looking around, Sungwoo found Victor and over a thousand zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he yelled at Victor, “Victor! Revoke all summons of your subordinate spirits!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? Crackle!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Recover mana from your zombies!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Understood!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Victor at first looked puzzled because he didn’t understand Sungwoo’s intentions but followed his order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the zombies who were excluded from Victor’s “subordinate spirits” became wobbly and collapsed. Now there were their bodies everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Evil Spirit Bombing’ dwells in your weapon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo once again triggered the Evil Spirit Bombing then fired them at the tsar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the tsar changed into a turtle shape right away, protecting his body. However, this time he did not easily give up the turtle shape because he was hit directly by the giant’s feet the moment he was released from it a little while ago.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo seized the moment and attacked his soft spot when he was noticeably slow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Twilight Raid.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>– ‘Twilight Raid’ has begun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned into a black whirlwind and rushed toward him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Goooooooooooo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how powerful the tsar was, he couldn’t withstand the Twilight Raid. The tsar’s body was entangled in a black tornado and swept away. A few seconds later, he was thrown on the ground violently. At the same time, the hand of the ghost came up from the ground and bound his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kheeeeeee! You son of a bitch!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, there was an odor coming from the surroundings. It was from the ‘field of zombie corpses’ that Victor created a little while ago.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking down on him, Sungwoo murmured, “Keep crouching well, so you can be roasted well.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he jumped off the ground and got out of the zombie corpse field.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He shouted at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Explosion!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Without changing the shape behind his back, he was helplessly engulfed in the explosion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment Mir, who was in Jisu’s arms, released mana at the same time when Sungwoo did. It was a corpse explosion magic. And Victor also participated in the chain explosion subtly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Explode! Crackle!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kwa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wang-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Over a thousand zombies exploded when Sungoo, Mir, and Victor released mana at the same time, bursting with tremendous shock and heat. It was as if an oil refinery had exploded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When one explosion stopped, two or three explosions followed in succession, shaking the whole Yongsan area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The melting heat spread into the air, quickly heating the Siberian cold around Yongsan. A magnificent haze arose at the point of the explosions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is it over?” Hanho asked, but nobody answered because they didn’t know until they confirmed the results.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was Jisu who first noticed something unusual.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, it’s not over.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the smoke from the explosion disappeared, and something was moving.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Keeeeeeeeeeeeh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the tsar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Is he still alive? How could he survive?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tsar, covered with wounds and in tatters, raised himself from the ground, his eyes full of resentment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Necromancer….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the “Demon Beasts” began to gather behind him. They were united again and changed into a completely different shape, which was a black dog with three heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I will tear you to pieces and kill you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Cerberus? Is that his deity form?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the tsar raised his head, the three heads charged at Sungwoo. Sungwoo could not escape by throwing his body. Fortunately, he escaped it through the shadow movement at the last minute.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kwa-wa-wa-wang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The three heads hit the Yongsan Station building. As if three demolition cranes with iron beads moved at the same time, the ceiling and the outer walls of the station collapsed like shattered glass.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Yongsan Station was destroyed in a series of explosions. So much so that it was an unrecognizable shell as if somebody with three hands pulled down a handful of sandcastles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This is dangerous.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Three giant heads turned and found Sungwoo. When they revealed their teeth and released black smoke, Sungwoo was reminded of a hellish world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Necromancer… you are smart. I admit you’re smart, but you are finished. Thanks to you, I’m now fully sober.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar survived Sungwoo’s double attacks. How could he deal with the tsar?<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If I allow his attack, it will kill me instantly.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Sungwoo racked his brain to find a way to block the tsar’s attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘It wasn’t that the explosion had no damage on him. If I can aim for another chance…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment the whole world has turned white. Both the sky and the ground were swallowed up by the light. All the shade disappeared and the outlines of things blurred. Everyone had to stop moving and cover their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Light?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was no sign of anything. All they could sense was that the light reached this place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As everything around them turned white, a flash of light came from the sky. Then, dozens of lightning bolts poured out like a waterfall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not only Sungwoo but also the tsar stepped back, wary of that unexpected phenomenon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tramp- Tramp-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Amid the beam of light appeared a familiar face. It was a man wearing black ‘hard leather armor’ and holding a wooden hawk-carved cane.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I came here, feeling the energy of hell. What the heck is this? Just a pilgrim?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was Kangsok Han, the No. 1 in the Korean server rankings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He glanced up and down the tsar with an irritated expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Four-star cards and a hell pilgrim. I came down because I smelled something disgusting. Was it you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The fairy and butterfly flew over Kangsok’s shoulders and looked around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Gosh, it’s so boring! I’ve been looking forward to it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The butterfly flew toward Sungwoo and his party, waving at them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hi! It’s been a long time!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But no one returned the fairy’s greetings because they were in a dangerous situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a sulky expression, the fairy sat down on his shoulders again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn! I hate you all!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking at the situation, the tsar looked frustrated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kangsok approached the tsar and said, “Hey, hell pilgrim, you are now using the hellish power with the support of the Angel camp, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t pretend to be innocent when you have the three dogs behind you like that. I came down here after gathering all the information about you. By the way, that’s not even a regular deity, isn’t it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How do you know that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kangsok smiled at him scornfully. He walked slowly and closer to the tsar. And he boldly put his hand on the tsar’s shoulder.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar’s eyebrows wriggled. Normally, he would have raged into anger, but he was just staring at Kangsok silently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kangsok opened his mouth in no time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I am the one who will become the lord of hell, the devil king.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar’s eyebrows wriggled again, and Sungwoo also frowned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Devil king?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo couldn’t understand what it meant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, he could understand why he was so obsessed with the place called ‘hell’ and what kind of quest he was proceeding with.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘By the way, demon king? Does it mean he has the power to control the monsters of hell?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The background of the game became more and more complicated as the days went by. Following the “Devil’s Gate” dominated by World Eater, “Hell” seemed to be more than just a dungeon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it. You must be No. 1 in the Korean server rankings, right? You are also that player who devastated the southern island of Japan, right? Yeah, I remember you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, No. 1 in the Russian server rankings and No. 1 in the Korean server rankings stood face to face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I knew you were awesome when I watched you on TV, but when I watched you here, I now know how strong you are.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kangsok just chuckled at his words, and said, tapping the tsar on the shoulder once more, “Hey, just run away now instead of trying to show foolish pride.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though he was completely sober, the tsar blushed again because of anger and humiliation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What did you say?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was the No. 1 warrior in Russia. If he turned after he was humiliated like this, he would not survive the harsh tundra fields.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He smiled faintly and manipulated the three heads of the black dog behind him. No matter how strong Kangsok was, he was confident of killing the strongest Korean player on the spot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Your people are originally so arrogant like this…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the tsar couldn’t finish his words because he was thrown through the air and got jammed into a rusty truck when something flashed before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kheeeeeeeeeeeeeek!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching him, Kangsok smiled and said, “Don’t try to trick me. I’m smarter than you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, you are so damn slow! Idiot!” </div><h2 id="chapter284">Chapter 284</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>In fact, Kangsok didn’t move at all. All he did was shoot a beam of light from his cane.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the tsar shook his head, feeling dizzy as if the whole world was twisting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But he still didn’t give up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haha…” The tsar raised himself with a feigned laugh. While he was at it, he was still looking for a way to kill Kangsok, which showed his hunter’s instinct.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Anyway, he is a wizard-type. His damage is enormous, but I can kill him with one stroke. Let me block his attack by changing into a turtle shape and attack him.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>But before he put together his arms, another flash occurred.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His body bounced like a ball, pushed the truck, and rolled on the concrete floor randomly. His head broke and blood gushed. And his left knee was folded upside down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar’s plan failed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, you are not only incompetent but also stupid. If you’re so stupid, you won’t live long.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kangsok held out his cane. It was the first time he moved since the battle broke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, a spark erupted from the tip of his cane, and hundreds of thin rays of light poured out and wrapped the tsar’s body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar’s body soared as if being attracted by a magnet. A terrifying electric current began to strike every corner of his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kangsok walked slowly, swinging the cane. When he took each step forward, it seemed to increase the intensity of the current.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think your game is over.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>But at that moment, the tsar broke through the electric current, reached out his hand, and picked something from his pocket. It was a familiar object in Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘That’s an angel’s wing piece.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was an item that could teleport its user to the ‘Angel’s Statue’ within a certain range, which Sungwoo once used during the raid in Taiwan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar used it to escape in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kangsok stopped the attack and pulled the cane back. He frowned and stared into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The tsar disappeared in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The butterfly soared and opened her eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No! Did you miss him?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I guess so. Looks like the portal just opened. I never expected he could move his arm when he was shocked.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Of course! You should have killed him quickly!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, he wasn’t the one who could stand in the way of my plans anyway.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s just an excuse!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The butterfly kept whining and punching and kicking his shoulders.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if he didn’t care, Kangsok turned casually and looked at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Necromancer, it’s been a long time! I didn’t know we would meet here like this.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His eyes turned to Jisu. More precisely, he was looking at Mir in her arms.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“World tree, and now a dragon? You are overflowing with item blessings. What I’ve got is this noisy butterfly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? What did you say now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, what brought you here?” asked Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kangsok just scratched his cheek, then said, “Actually, I didn’t know you were here. I just have the ability to sense the power of hell. I came because of the quest I had been proceeding with.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Devil King?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, did you hear it?” said Kangsok, smiling bitterly. “It’s a childish and funny name, right? Just think of it as a hidden deity.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, you’re chasing the gate of hell after clearing the quest and becoming the Devil King?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kangsok nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. It’s a long quest, but now I’m starting to get sick and tired of it, so I want to stop it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Gosh, you’re so weak!” said the butterfly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Given the implication of ‘Devil King,’ Kangsok’s ambition to become the king was like proclaiming that he would become a heinous being. Sungwoo’s name, the Necromancer, was also often described as an evil being.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Therefore, the most important thing was his ‘intention’. In other words, it was important to find out what Kangsok would want to do after becoming the Devil King.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It may be a strange question, but what good is it for you when you become the Devil King? Aren’t hell monsters invading the Earth? Can you stop them?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Have you heard about the World Eater?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He mentioned a familiar name.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, that giant eye! That’s so disgusting!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Butterfly, just get out of here, please.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded slowly at his question.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then I don’t need to explain it in detail. If we don’t do anything, our Earth will be ruined by them, and if you are complacent, you are going to be ruled by the Angel or Demon camp. Anyway, they are basically invaders with a different name. Then, what should we do?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately replied, “Well we need to build an independent power, so we can’t rely on either camp.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kangsok nodded with a smile and said, “Yeah, I think you are doing very well in that regard. In my view, the one who can survive alone in the end wins. That’s what I’m doing now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He suddenly praised Sungwoo, but Sungwoo was confused whether he should think of Kangsok as his ally.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the butterfly flew, then put her palm on her forehead and looked somewhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kangsok! Again! Again! Look southeast!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn quest, it won’t give me any break! It looks like the door to hell has been opened somewhere,” He said with a sigh as if he was tired.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I wish we could talk in a more relaxed mood later. But can we ever have such a chance?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you can survive, sure we will.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay. Please don’t die.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, Kangsok disappeared to the portal opened by the butterfly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho, who was watching them from behind, said with a sign, sighed “Wow, what the hell has happened? I’m so confused… I only remember the buzzing noise of the butterfly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo agreed with that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Minhum standing behind him said, “Sungwoo, please take care of our men here. Let me go and check whether the Crusader Team members are alive.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and his party could not afford to take a break just because the tsar was gone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the tsar fled alone, the Siberian hunters surrendered without any resistance. No matter how tough they were, they did not try to resist to the end in a faraway country.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tatana, the annoying freezing wizard, died in battle. As a result, the curse that froze the entire Crusader Team disappeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The news spread through the Wide Area Surveillance Team that Junghoon and the Crusader Team were awakened finally.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What a relief!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But that wasn’t the end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, our Commander says he wants to talk with you urgently.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo instinctively sensed that it might not be good news. About ten minutes later, a helicopter landed. Junghoon, who was exhausted, got off the helicopter. He seemed as if he would collapse anytime soon, barely managing to stand, supported by Minhum.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, you helped me like this, I’m sorry to give you more bad news…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Just tell me without any worries.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon nodded his head, then took his breath and continued, “Yesterday, I broke the statue of the angel.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was something unexpected. The Liberation Guild has belonged to the Angel camp for quite a long time. They were the core supporters of the Angel camp on the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We were cursed when I broke it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What’s the curse?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Eleven hours from now, an angel will come to Yeongdeungpo Station. And I hear the angel will punish the whole of Seoul. The Absolute Race people will come down.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>These guys who had been trying to dominate the Korean server for a long time using all kinds of tactics finally decided to act on their own.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seeing Junghoon’s anxious expression, Sungwoo calmly nodded and said, “Does the angel have any bones?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If Kangsok conquered hell and tried to become the Devil King, it meant he could conquer the place where the Angel race lived. </div><h2 id="chapter285">Chapter 285</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>It was 10 hours before the arrival of the angel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re going to start the temperature now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But there was something more urgent than that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It is currently measured at negative 34 degrees centigrade near Mt. Namsan in Seoul! As for the temperature of the center, we need to get close to measure it precisely!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Wide Area Surveillance Team reported the results of the temperature they measured with specialized equipment on a helicopter flying over Namsan. According to their report, the temperature in Seoul kept falling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo, his party, and Junghoon were getting warm in a building near Mt. Namsan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After a while, Minhum came back and briefed them about the situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“After interrogating the Russian prisoners, we found out what they planted in Mt. Namsan was the so-called ‘Frozen Seed’. It means something like a winter seed. It’s a strategic weapon that quickly lowers the surrounding temperature and freezes the whole area.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you remove it, does the freezing function stop?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo asked, Minhum said with a nod, “Yes. The problem is without that woman sorcerer named Tatana, nobody can touch it. It’s so cold that you won’t be able to even touch it when it’s running unless you have enough cold resistance.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon swept his face down with his palm as if he was frustrated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tatana was the person who used the freezing magic strong enough to freeze the entire Crusader Team. Who else has that kind of cold resistance? There was none like her, as far as Junghoon knew.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo stood up and said, “I know something.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? Do you even have cold resistance?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, I’ve got something similar.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo could endure the strong cold through the “Salamander’s Aura”, the effect of the flame traits opposite to cold resistance. There would be some limitations. He wondered how far he could endure it, but right now, there was no other way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I have to finish it before the angel comes down, so let’s move right now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Members of the Wide Area Surveillance Team wearing specially modified cold protection equipment were climbing Mt. Namsan. Water vapor was rising from their bodies then soon became frost and landed on their shoulders.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haaa… haaa…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s a blizzard ahead!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They wore gas masks and attached ‘burning stones’ they obtained by hunting “fire golems” inside their coats made of the leather of the “Ice Troll”. They felt hot as if there was a heater attached to their bodies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, even when they were thoroughly prepared for the extreme cold, they had no choice but to feel cold as they approached the top of Mt. Namsan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The blizzard is so severe! Everybody, grab the rope and move in a single file!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Move in a single file!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After such a hard hike, they finally reached near the peak. When they looked up, they saw Namsan Tower standing in a blizzard, but thick ice was sticking to it as if the Ice Age had arrived.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Set up the equipment and measure the core temperature!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They installed precision temperature measurement equipment then aimed the laser at the center of the blizzard. A number appeared on the dashboard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The core temperature of the blizzard is negative 259 degrees centigrade!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Absolute zero,” commonly known as the temperature of outer space, was negative 273 degrees centigrade. So, the temperature at the core of the frozen seed was comparable to that of the space.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crazy… Now, we’re getting out of the blizzard! From now on, the Necromancer will carry out the operation!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get out of the blizzard!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While the crew members were retreating, a helicopter flew to the slope of Namsan Mountain. But the point was the limit where the helicopter could fly because there was a great possibility that if the helicopter flew further, it would be caught in a blizzard and crash.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A man jumped out of the hovering helicopter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He has arrived! Necromancer!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God! Is there anything impossible for him?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer, wearing black armor with blue flames, walked uphill covered with snow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every step he took, the snow that accumulated as high as his knees melted into a fan shape and disappeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheeeeeeeeeeeeee-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The operation team leader stepped forward to welcome the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think the target of our temperature measurement is stuck right under the Namsam Tower!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since they couldn’t get into the blizzard, they had no choice but to estimate the location as accurately as possible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“And the core temperature is negative 259 degrees centigrade, so if you breathe in, your lungs will be frozen. Is it still okay with you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No problem!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Just in case, our team is on standby, but we cannot guarantee we will take any action to help you if something happens to you inside. Sorry.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it.” Sungwoo calmly nodded then walked straight to Namsan Tower without any particular preparation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The operational team leader who followed him was forced to fall back at some point because he couldn’t endure the cold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please be careful.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo disappeared into the blizzard without looking back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can he make it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The team leader shook his head when one of his team members asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I have no idea. If he can’t succeed, we have to pack up and flee from Seoul.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haaa… By the way, why is that person always our last hope?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The team leader knew the right answer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, it’s because he has never failed. And there is no other player after him because all the events and quest ended once and for all when he intervened.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But no one could be sure what would happen to him this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whooooooooooo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The blizzard was so severe that no one could see further than their noses. Since the trail was also covered with snow, nobody could walk on the right trail. It was the so-called whiteout phenomenon that could be seen in a snowfield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fortunately, Sungwoo had a hidden weapon that was not affected by the laws of physics. It was a ‘Spector’. He could move forward little by little by relying on its eyesight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At last, he reached the heart of the blizzard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Goo Goo Goo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>A huge pillar of ice towered over him. There was a hole in the middle of the long column, where a white ball was vibrating, floating in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Frozen Seed’ is working.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Creates an ice age in the area (Seoul). (22:44:00)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* If you want to stop it, you have to remove it from the ‘tower’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Ice age? Man, it was terrible stuff.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a weapon strong enough to blow up the entire ecosystem of a certain area as the Russian players confessed after they were interrogated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I can’t get closer.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even if he was wearing Hellfire Armor and wearing Salamander’s Aura, Sungwoo couldn’t overcome all the cold. His whole body got cold rapidly, and his fingers and toes began to hurt. He might already have gotten frostbite.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo summoned two “troll skeletons”. If he couldn’t go inside directly, there were plenty of skeletons who could do it for him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pick that one.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, right after he summoned the troll skeletons, frost began to accumulate all over their bodies. The blizzard penetrated their bones, making it difficult for them to move their joints.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They tried to move forward, but the moment they reached out to the pillar of the Frozen Seed, they were frozen completely and stopped moving.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Any subject with a physical form can’t approach it.’ </div><h2 id="chapter286">Chapter 286</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>After all, Sungwoo used another hidden card. He unfolded Bi Hyong’s ghost fan and summoned a horde of ghosts. They lifted the bone weapons made by Sungwoo with telekinetic power and flew towards the Frozen Seed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The powerful magical energy of the affected area blocks the access of the ‘spiritual being’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ghosts were pushed away like a piece of cloth blown by the wind. Frozen Seed wasn’t an easy target.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, should I go inside?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>There seemed to be no other way in Sungwoo’s eyes. He took out the “Fire Spirit Stone (Higher),” which he had placed near his heart. Fortunately, he could prevent his blood from freezing because of this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay, let me go inside.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo grabbed the object in his right hand tightly and stepped into the blizzard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tramp- Tramp-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The closer he got to the Frozen Seed, the more he lost his senses gradually. He now found it hard to bend his joints. Every time he breathed, his heart hurt. The breath he exhaled became solid and scattered instantly. At one point, even his vision became blurry.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If I don’t do anything now, I will die soon.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He couldn’t stand it even a minute. Feeling the cold, he finally stood before the Frozen Seed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You are now being exposed to severe cold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All physical abilities decrease (-70%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>If he felt so cold like this when he was standing around the Frozen Seed, it would be suicide for him to touch the Frozen Seed, just as standing near a wood fire was different from putting one’s hand in a wood fire.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, if he could use the ‘Fire Spirit Stone’, he could offset the cold and give it a shock.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo raised his hand hard with difficulty and struck the Frozen Seed with the Fire Spirit Stone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang―<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Frozen Seed shook roughly. Sungwoo once again raised his hand and struck it hard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang―<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like a train running off the metals, the Frozen Seed, which was shaking violently, bounced out of the hole of the ice tower. Sungwoo succeeded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Frozen Seed’ has stopped working.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the blizzard that was blowing all over the place stopped.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whoooooooo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if the pure white curtain was cut off and fell, the white veil collapsed on the ground. The unobstructed scenery of the snow on Mt. Namsan unfolded before his eyes. It was beautiful.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Since you have survived the strong cold, your cold resistance increases. (+2%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo picked up a white marble that fell on the snowfield. It was still cold to the touch, but he could stand it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Frozen Seed<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Orb<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Grants the traits of ‘snow man’ for more than 100 days, cold resistance increases (+10%), mana consumption decreases when using freezing-type magic (-80%). Causes ‘Ice Age’ in a certain area when it’s installed in a high area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stopped the Ice Age from arriving in Seoul.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though Sungwoo solved the case at the risk of his life, he had to tackle another big case right after that. Sungwoo’s party and Junghoon’s Crusader team gathered at the entrance of Yeongdeungpo Station. It was time for them to stop the descent of the angel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The Angel statue we possessed was somewhat different.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He said that he had an angel statue of a higher grade than that of an ordinary grade. Namely, a statue with four wings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Was it because of that? Junghoon had been forced to become the vanguard of a ridiculous quest that only pursued the interests of the Angel camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the end, Junghoon couldn’t stand it and broke the statue. By breaking it, he wanted to shake his hands off and get out of the camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But once I belonged to the camp, it was impossible for me to withdraw from it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He said that the moment he struck the angel’s statue with his sword, a warning message appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have made an indelible mistake. After a certain period of time, the “Angel Judge” will come down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All players who have joined the Angel camp through the Angel statue will be ‘punished.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>(All stats will be reduced by 90% when they face the Angel Judge.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* The target of the judgment cannot leave the Seoul area. No matter where you are hiding, the “Angel Judge” will go after you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* On the day of the Angel Judge’s descent, if you select and offer 500 sacrifices (players) and repent your sins, you can be forgiven.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon shook his head, recalling the warning message.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, you were right from the beginning. I now know playing into the hands of the Absolute Race had nothing to do with the happy ending… Yeah, I’ve come to realize it now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s not too late yet.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The remaining time until the Angel Judge’s descent was about 7 hours. So, Sungwoo and his allies could prepare and confront the judge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, like Junghoon explained, the Liberation Guild belonging to the Angel camp could not confront the judge. A 90% reduction in their stats meant that they could not fight at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, that’s right. But we are not going to give up either. If we had given up, we would have been killed much earlier.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was strong determination and fighting spirit on his face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded and said, “From now on we must build up our strength. The Angel camp is not the only one targeting us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Devil…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There are more terrible things…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Angel, the Devil, and the World Eater were all no different. With different names, all of them wanted to take control of this world. Among them, “World Eater” was the worst.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘And there is another one above them, who is watching my words and action closely. He’s called The Creator. Even if I stop all of them, I will just play into the Creator’s hand if I don’t know what He wants.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a message appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Exclusive Quest]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Guardian’s Duty-2<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Type: Goal Guardian<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Goal: Protect the Angel camp’s target of judgment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Reward: Choose the ‘upgrading of your deity’ or the right to change your job<br/><br/><br/><br/>*An external being known as the Absolute Race, or the Angel race, is supposed to come down to slaughter people on this earth. As the “guardian” of this earth, you have the duty to remove pressure from the external being. If you stop the plans of the Angel race, you will be able to inflict big losses on them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You will fail when more than 80% of the ‘target of judgment’ dies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Additional rewards will be provided when you kill the ‘Angel Judge’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a quest related to the title of ‘Guardian’. Sungwoo knew it was triggered when the Gate of Hell and the Devil’s Gate were opened.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Then, it means that the Absolute Race is not different from the monsters, right?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo now realized that the title “Guardian” he possessed meant the person who defended this land with an independent force, not with the help of any external force.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Therefore, such guardians were inevitably very few because most of those who survived the destruction succumbed to the temptation of the Absolute Race and relied on their power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘By the way, the upgrading of my deity?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, the reward caught his eye. The ‘Anubis’ power’ that he currently had was described as the first stage. If so, did it mean that it was going to be upgraded to the second stage? Then, could he make another huge development? Whatever it was, Sungwoo had no choice but to look forward to it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, how should we prepare?” Junghoon asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After pondering over it briefly, Sungwoo opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please gather as many people as possible who deal with water and fire.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Water and fire?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Right. Let’s splash water on the unwelcome guest!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, what Sungwoo was preparing was not just the downpour of water alone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He felt some intense energy in his pocket. </div><h2 id="chapter287">Chapter 287</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The expected place of the angel’s advent was ‘above Youngdungpo Station’. In fact, it was never specifically stated, but the Liberation Guild speculated like that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If the angel comes down to judge us, she will come down where we are because we can’t escape Seoul anyway.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Minhum said, it was unlikely that the Absolute Race would secretly descend in a corner of Seoul then sneak up to them to attempt an assassination.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The core fighters of the Liberation Guild began responding based on such speculation, and soon, Youngdungpo Station became noisy with them preparing for the defense.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Large vehicles are coming in! Please move away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Place the water tanks right here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon and Minhum, who were standing on the rooftop of the station, were looking down at all the preparations. They were preparing in unison, and the leaders of each team came up and briefed them about the progress of their preparations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The first one to report was the supply team leader.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have mobilized all the sprinklers. And we also moved all the rainwater tanks we had collected nearby.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good job. If you can mobilize more from nearby places, please get them all.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, let me check once more.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fire trucks they mobilized from all over Seoul arrived at several places. They were all filled with water.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next to report to them was the security team leader.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have placed players on each rooftop capable of dealing with freeze and fire-type wizards and water spirits. When they use their magic, we will be able to use the water sprayed from the sprinklers and the water tanks on the rooftop.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. Deploy multiple tanks to protect them. That’s the heart of this battle.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The team leaders kept reporting about the status of their preparations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time the transport team leader said, “The fire helicopters are filled with water. If you give orders, we can pour tons of water at once.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please have the pilots on standby all the time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Firefighting helicopters used for transportation were restored to their original function after a long time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, all the water that they could draw from Youngdungpo was stored in various forms.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it. I will report to you right away if I have any additional things.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Upon receiving all the reports, Minhum suddenly looked around. The man who asked for this kind of preparation was not seen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Commander, where did Sungwoo go?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon shook his head. He also has not seen Sungwoo since they started to prepare for the defense. So, he just believed Sungwoo was taking some important measures right now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, can you figure out why he has asked to collect so much water like this? Even the swimming pool wouldn’t use this much water, as you know.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo asked them to collect all the water as much as possible, but he didn’t explain why the water was needed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Normally, Junghoon would have objected, but since everything depended on Sungwoo, they had no choice but to trust and follow him. Furthermore, he understood why Sungwoo didn’t tell him the reason.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think Sungwoo is right. Since we belong to the Angel camp as of now, it’s possible that this kind of information can be leaked to the Angel camp, so it seems safe that we just don’t know.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That makes sense!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Absolute Race would be watching over this land. Junghoon couldn’t figure out what method they used, but the most promising method was to use the players under his command. Of course, Junghoon and his players were still registered as the ‘target of judgment’ because he broke the angel statue and escaped from them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Because they can still use our eyes and mouths, we should be careful.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If the weaker side dared to confront the stronger side, they had to be very prudent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Time passed. The remaining time until the angel would come down began to pass, which deepened their worries and anxiety.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The time remaining until ‘the Angel’s Advent’ (00:01:42)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, it’s only a little over one minute left. The players of the Liberation Guild on standby could not hide their anxiety.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are we all dying when this time passes? What if we die even without confronting them?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, why are you making such an ominous comment? We’re all here to fight back, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But they are the Absolute Race. Shall we be able to fight them?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ironically, the very being they served and followed would be judging them. They just felt uncomfortable. They felt as if they were uprising against God.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Therefore, they needed a new spiritual leader, some hero who could be a strong supporter enough to fight against the Absolute Being.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Even if we didn’t know, the Necromancer was constantly fighting the Absolute Race. He is right here with us right now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Naturally, they came to repeat the name of the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, if you think about it, didn’t the Absolute Race keep losing to him?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s right. They even issued a world quest, but they were defeated. Well, they might not be the Absolue Race in that respect.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Absolute Being had been defeated several times already, so they began to gradually realize that they could stand up on their own and survive. Such awakening made them pluck up courage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. Let’s fight to the end!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, where is that man? I haven’t seen him for a while. He must be working on some strategy…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man could not finish his words because time was up now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Time remaining until the ‘judgment.’ (00:00:00)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It is the beginning.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as it started, there was silence among them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The air around them became heavier.<br/><br/><br/><br/>More precisely, the flow of air stopped. Then, as if the wind disappeared from the world and the sound evaporated, perfect silence came.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Without saying anything, everybody raised their heads and looked up at the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A blue sky and a mass of heavy clouds were slowly passing over Youngdungpo Station, but there seemed to be nothing strange about it yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, look over there…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the abnormal sign started from something very trivial. There was a hole in the middle of the cloud. And soon the whole clouds began to disappear. Specifically, the clouds were being sucked somewhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s a hole!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Someone muttered quietly. There was a hole in the sky. It was a portal of enormous size.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A portal is a door. Yes, someone opened the door. If so, what will come out of that door?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wind and sound that had disappeared came back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wind and the sound were insane. They became a roaring sound like the cry of a beast, as if they were awakened from the primitive nature that had been asleep, and blew above their heads wildly<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, something began to come down very slowly from the door that was opened from the other world. It had pure white toes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is that an angel?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The angel put her feet into this world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘Angel Judge’ has begun to come down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Because of the ‘Angel Judge’s power’, all your stats are drastically reduced. (-90%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the moment when the Absolue Race revealed themselves for the first time in the history of the Korean server and other servers around the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh! I feel like I’m emaciated…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I feel like my legs have become wobbly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players of the Liberation Guild began to feel restless, faced with the expected curse.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Keep your place! We’re going to confront them according to our operation!” </div><h2 id="chapter288">Chapter 288</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>However, none of them moved from their assigned positions. They were patiently waiting for Junghoon’s order and the Necromancer even though their legs were quaking violently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if the angel’s body was tied to a string, she slowly descended. She had nothing like wings. She was just huge, white, flat, and soft. Like a newborn child, her white skin was rather pink.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When she approached the station with the sun against her back, a huge shadow engulfed the entire Youngdungpo Station. In the darkness brought about by the white body, the players lifted their heads and looked at the angel at an extremely high altitude.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The angel also slowly lowered her head toward the players. Her fluffy blonde hair was brilliant, but her face was far from beautiful.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Is that the Angel we have relied on?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is nonsense.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Her white and soft face had only a mouth. Her pink mouth stretched from her forehead to the tip of her chin and slowly opened with translucent saliva falling from it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was the reality of the angel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Gee, now is the time! Sprinkle it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They couldn’t wait any longer. If they delayed it, they would find out what punishment that terrible being would mete out to them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Spray water!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As directed by the Necromancer, high-pressure hoses placed in all directions began to spray water profusely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the water spirits controlled by someone made a wave-like waterway from the open water tank and marched toward the angel. Tons of water soared with just one single magic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Spell fire magic in the air!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our target is not the angel, but the air! Evaporate the water!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the flame magic was cast. It got entangled with the water, causing something like water vapor in a wet sauna.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But all their attacks were in vain. There was no way that such water bombs could inflict any damage. No matter how powerful they sprayed water, it just scattered into the air when it approached the angel. All of the air and mana nearby belonged to the angel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, the angel was in control of this area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A rainbow spread over the shoulders of the angel hovering in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoon clenched his fists while watching the angel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I still don’t know what the angel is trying to do, but take some action quickly, no matter what.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the angel said, “You guys will see your final moment today.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the players standing near the angel collapsed after losing their strength.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nobody knew what happened to them, but the angel seemed to have exercised something like absolute power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck! How could they…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! We are going to be killed!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The angel lifted her left hand forward, slowly. Then, the water drops that surrounded her stopped moving in the air immediately. It seemed that God was doing miracles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You guys are just meaningless and worthless.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>More players in a wider area fell at the angel’s words.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? Are they dead just like that? Everyone, step back!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The angel’s attack range was gradually expanding. Death began to slowly swallow Youngdungpo. And their despair spread faster than that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Just run away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No! Keep spraying water on the angel!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you crazy, captain?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players’ will to survive knew no limits now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The will to live began to explode.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shut up! Fire water cannons!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How long should we keep doing this? All of us are going to die!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you think you can survive by running away? The Necromancer is the only answer now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, when is that person coming?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right, at that moment he appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Kuggugugugugu!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ground under the angel’s feet suddenly sank. There was an explosion underground. And a handful of blue flames soared from it. It was a very trifling movement compared to the gigantic angel, but everyone’s eyes now turned toward it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He has arrived!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was none other than the Necromancer, the angel’s opponent as well as the man who got rid of the Absolute Race’s footprints on the Korean server. Standing tall on the ground, he looked up at the angel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Welcome to our land.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In his left hand, he was holding a jewel that gave off red energy, and in his right hand, he was holding a jewel that gave off blue energy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as the Necromancer appeared, the water in the area began to boil and evaporate because his body was blowing out tremendous heat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The angel’s long mouth wriggled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You sinful existence; you can’t reach me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? But it’s not me you have to fight.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While saying so, Sungwoo dropped the blue jewel “Frozen Seed” in his right hand right under the angel’s feet. At the same time, he jumped off the ground and moved back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as the jewel was stuck on the ground, a pillar of ice soared from the ground, holding the “Frozen Seed”. At that moment, the temperature in the area began to drop rapidly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Frozen Seed’ is in operation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* The temperature of the whole area is dropping sharply.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* A powerful blizzard will blow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everything happened in an instant. The water drops that had been sprayed expanded rapidly after being frozen. A huge amount of water or huge chunks of ice filled the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Keep spraying the water!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Spray the water!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then evaporate it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The water drops that the angel used her power to stop moving in the air now backfired, threatening her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dozens and hundreds of tons of water and water vapor floating around her body froze all at once, binding the angel’s body tightly like a straitjacket.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was why he ordered the players to sprinkle and evaporate tons of water.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Goo Goo Goo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>A blizzard created a huge glacier above Youngdungpo Station. The body of the angel was buried entirely in the glacier. She had no time to move at all because it all happened in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Frozen Seed’ is in operation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Creates an ice age in the area (Seoul). (49:59:59)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* If you want to stop the operation, you have to separate it from the ‘tower’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The angel murmured, “How dare you play a trick on me…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Her long mouth stiffened quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s why you should have checked the local weather. You will feel frozen to the bone here, regret the winter of Korea.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The giant angel froze entirely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Angel Judge was certainly an overwhelming being.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, that angel is tremendous.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She was bigger than any tall building in Youngdungpo Station. She was the largest of all the monsters that had appeared on the Korean server so far.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players couldn’t do anything, buried under her magnificent shadow. Just raising their heads and looking up blankly was all they could do.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kheeeeee!! I still can’t breathe well.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Those with lower levels, step back!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though the angel did not launch any serious attack, many players lost their minds or died just by being in the same space as the angel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just like the title ‘judge’ suggested, it was obvious that the system designed the Liberation Guild as an entity that was virtually impossible to resist because they were stigmatized as the ‘target’ of judgment by the angel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Therefore, this was an event that should have been conducted unilaterally as the system designed, so this event was a clear lesson for all participants. In other words, the event was a clear warning to all that they would receive a heavy punishment if they betrayed the Absolute camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, such a warning was ignored by the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! He’s the Necromancer we have been looking forward to!” </div><h2 id="chapter289">Chapter 289</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Watching the angel completely frozen in a blizzard, the players recalled only one name. The Necromancer, the adversary of the Absolute Race, once again tarnished the lofty image of the angel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is it all over now?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The angel was motionless. The secret operation that involved the sprinkling of hundreds of tons of water over the angel to freeze her by activating the “Frozen Seed” was successful.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But they could not relax yet. Many of them were watching the angel with bated breath and their eyes trembled.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s not over yet. When the ice melts, the angel will move again. And maybe she will break through before that.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They could not shake off their anxiety. It seemed that the overwhelming existence of the angel was frozen, but stood firmly inside the ice, and someday, she would move again and destroy the Liberation Guild.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They talked about the worst that could happen as if they were alarmists. They were not worrying unnecessarily. It was the expression of a natural sentiment of the weak who had to watch out for the worst crisis.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was different.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can win.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the moment, when he froze that gigantic angel, Sungwoo was already convinced of victory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, his strategy was close to gambling. And as soon as this gamble worked, he was convinced that everything would work out as expected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To put it simply, he almost won.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If we mount a general offensive right now, we can kill the angel at once.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Evil Spirit Bombing’ dwells in your weapon. (MAX)<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, an undead army appeared behind Sungwoo and lined up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo finished preparations for the battle and looked at the rooftop of Youngdungpo Station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Junghoo and Minhum standing on the rooftop were looking down at Sungwoo. Since they entrusted him with everything, they were now waiting for his next order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Have the flying weapons ready!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he shouted, Minhum came to his senses and immediately picked up the radio. Soon, the flying weapons that had been prepared in advance began to move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not only those owned by the Liberation Guild, but also fire arrow rockets that Sungwoo stored in the inventory aimed at the frozen angel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And Minhum’s voice blared out from the speakers installed throughout Youngdungpo Station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, we’ve all the flying weapons, all the shooters and all the wizards on standby right now. Just let us know when you need to attack.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo thought that something was still lacking. To kill the angel once and for all, he needed to mobilize all the firepower available.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo got aboard Bone Wyvern and soared into the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Deputy! I heard there is a corpse depository!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes. We have piled up the corpses of the monsters steadily to make them available for weapon materials.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please take out all of them right now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, are you going to use explosions?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum could immediately figure out what the Necromancer was going to do when he mentioned the corpses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, that’s right! We have to use all our weapons at once to blow up the angel with one stroke! Didn’t we clear the quest before the Frozen Seed turned Youngdungo Station into something like an Antarctic base, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minhum nodded and lifted the microphone. His voice came out of the speaker again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Support Team! Take out all the corpses from warehouse B33 and move them to the front! And the entire army should concentrate their attack on the angel. Our target is her head and chest! Concentrate your attack!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he gave a specific order for the first time, the players started moving again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t have time to idle away like this!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alright! Let’s smash the angel!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how scary the situation was, soldiers were supposed to act once they received an order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They began to demolish the angel’s ugly ice statue standing tall in the middle of Youngdungpo Station.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>How much time has passed? The explosions that kept banging like a drum stopped. With the blizzard fading away, a huge white body, namely the angel’s body was seen resting on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have earned 35,455,650 gold by hunting the ‘Angel Judge’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s over now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo recovered the Frozen Seed while looking up at the angel’s body. It was proved today that the absolute being that descended from the sky was by no means absolute.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘The Absolute Race is also no different from a single monster. If so, the World Eater would be like this.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Today’s battle proved lots of stuff. Sungwoo not only confronted the external beings but also beat them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have acquired the title of ‘Angel Killer.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Your magic resistance increases (+5%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Your fainting immunity increases (+10%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Your electric shock immunity increases (+10%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have leveled up. (LV. 23)<br/><br/><br/><br/>And the reward for his victory was enormous too. It’s been a long time since he saw the level-up message.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Is it the first time since I saw one during the Devil’s Gate quest?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a matter of fact, he has been engaged in more fighting the enemy players than hunting since then. It’s because he could obtain more EXP by hunting the monsters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, he put off choosing the level up card for now because his top priority was to obtain ‘deity upgrade’ above all, which he thought was so valuable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have cleared the exclusive quest  with ‘Additional Condition (Angel Judgment and Killing)’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You can choose a reward.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1) Regular upgrade of deity<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Right to change your job<br/><br/><br/><br/>As before, he could choose between the ‘regular upgrade of deity’ and ‘the right to change your job.’ Of course, what Sungwoo needed right now was the regular upgrade of deity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo chose No. 1 option.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Your deity grade has been upgraded. (Step 1 → Step 2)<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Skill information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Anubis’ Power (Step 2)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Demi God<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Classification: Passive and Active<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Consumption: 0<br/><br/><br/><br/>*For only one hour and 30 minutes per day, you can gain the power of ‘Anubis’ by gaining deity. All stats increase by (+15). You can use the exclusive skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, he could use the ‘Anubis’ for another 30 minutes, and all his stats also increased significantly from 10 to 15.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Well, I don’t have to be so impatient because of the time constraints in the future.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was not all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Additional reward is given for clearing the exclusive quest ‘Satisfying Additional Condition’ (Killing the Angel Judge)’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With that message, something came off the angel’s chest. It was a ray of light, which flew toward Sungwoo’s hand. A message rang right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Judge’s Mark<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Special<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Camp item<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: A person with this mark can designate a member of the same camp as the ‘target of judge’. (Location can be tracked, and all stats are temporarily reduced by 90%.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: This is the power that you can gain through the camp’s special achievements, which will be able to play an excellent role in maintaining the camp’s discipline and security.<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to the description, if the camp grew bigger, it would require a more subdivided organization, and some members could be given special positions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The “judge” was also seen as one of them, and this mark was an item that could be given to the leader of the legal entity who would mediate the problems arising within the camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘However, it will take a lot of time for us to be as big as the Absolute Race, so I don’t have to appoint a judge right now.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, there was an unexpected achievement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have met certain conditions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Lich (the one who deals with death) + Bi Hyong’s Fan (the one who controls ghosts) + the judge’s mark (the one who enforces the law) + the judge’s mark (one more judge’s mark is required.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This is the message that rang when I got Bi Hyong’s Fan.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that the “judge’s mark’ met the remaining conditions. However, because it needed a total of 2, he was not yet given the reward.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘So, what the heck is this?’ </div><h2 id="chapter290">Chapter 290</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">

<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The place where Sungwoo arrived, guided by Kyongsu, was outside Suwon. It was an old town, but a light smoke was rising from a store building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What’s that?” Hanho opened his mouth, raising his head. He was watching the rooftop of a store building. It was something like a ship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Isn’t it a real ship? Why is it here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a boat on top of a five-story store building. From a distance, it looked like unique architecture in a port city, but it was a real wooden sailboat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The sailboat with holes in various places around it was inclined downward on the crushed rooftop of the building, which looked pretty dangerous because it was likely to collapse at any moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is an airship traveling in the sky, not sailing in the sea,” said Kyongsu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is this flying?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes. I was also embarrassed to see it. It looks like it was hiding in a cloud, but it crashed in this place this morning with an explosion.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo checked it after hearing that, he noticed the ship was really different from the typical ships in the sea because it had huge engines on both sides of the hull.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The building might collapse, so we have to approach it carefully.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was dangerous for them to enter the building, so they got onto the rooftop of the building through the next building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While the players of the World Tree camp were on the lookout for any suspicious movement nearby, the technicians who were looking inside the sailboat came out to the deck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking down at Sungwoo and Kyungsoo, they explained the results of their investigation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“When we looked into the engine compartment, we found circular compartments for each engine. It looked like some important parts were missing. Perhaps some items that could fly the ship were there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Got it. It seems like the intruders took the part, but they must be very valuable.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If they were the items that could fly this huge object in the sky, they would definitely have tremendous value.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If then, doesn’t it mean there are a few more airships like this somewhere?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded at Kyongsu’s reasoning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Maybe there are players who can manufacture something like this, just like the Evolution Society made items in the field of biology.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muyon, who had the job of a “high architect,” built the wall several kilometers long in only a few days. As a result, there must be a player who could make such a huge piece of equipment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“America has the best technology even after its ruin? Sungwoo, if you approach it, the item information appears.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They installed a temporary foothold because the rooftop floor partially collapsed when the sailboat crashed. Sungwoo stood on the squeaking foothold and put his hand on the bottom of the ship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Dwarf Class 3 Airship<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Class: Unknown<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Player’s manufacturing item<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: High-altitude flight and large-scale defense barrier.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: This is , an aircraft transport plane made with Dwarf technology. 85 meters: long, maximum load capacity: 40 tons, total crew members: 55, maximum speed: 35 knots, general manager: Jonathan Cage, No. 1 External Affairs Team Leader. Other detailed information is confidential.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*This item is valuable and property of W·P·U, so anybody who approaches without authorization can be killed without warning. (Manufacturer’s direct description)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Status: Operation suspension (completely destroyed, no power source installed)<br/><br/><br/><br/>After reading the message, Sungwoo frowned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know what that means, but the message has lots of details.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s right. But I’m not sure if they are systematically organized…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo took a dim view of the fact that they were operating systematically because he had never seen any group with a system of their own operating like this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, a well-established system would be needed someday. But what’s important right now was a flexible survival strategy, not the procedures and rules that delayed decision-making.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’ve found a total of 42 bodies inside the ship. We can’t figure out what happened, but I assume there was a revolt inside.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>On one side of the rooftop, they were busy moving the corpses inside the ship. So, Sungwoo approached them because he could get lots of information from the corpses than anything else.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the corpses had their heads and limbs cut off altogether.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In this case, he could not confirm their memory fragments because he could not resurrect them as skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment Inho, who was in charge of managing the players at the accident site, approached.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Given the magnitude of the slaughter, don’t you think somebody with electric chainsaws came here from Texas in America?” he said jokingly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he began to explain, looking down at the corpses with a serious expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t know exactly why they did this terrible thing, but it looks like they slaughtered their targets brutally to make it impossible to identify who they were.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Their identity?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They come from very far. They were not definitely from the Korean server. Then, I guess there was a civil war.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His guesswork was interesting. Civil war beyond a simple revolt?<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo nodded, he continued, “Assuming the American people engaged in fighting with each other, they must have killed their opponents in a way that nobody could identify who the victims were.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded at his reasoning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That makes sense…” Jisu cut in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Drawing her sword, she came forward and stared at the sailboat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, we have to evacuate the people inside.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo did not ask what was going on because her reaction like this meant that something dangerous was going on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at Inho, who put the radio in his hand to his mouth without asking why.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everybody, escape from the sailboat right now! Get out of there right now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>In no time, the players working inside of the ship came out in droves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only then did Sungwoo look at Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, what’s going on?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s something small, but I can sense a lot of their movement in my ears like a bug.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately summoned two Specters. Then, he dispatched them deep inside the ship where she felt the sound of movement was coming from.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Specters penetrated the sailboat and reached the area in question in no time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a black box. Sungwoo read the information of that object through the Specters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ooooooooooooh-<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Player Killer Box (Poisonous Bug)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Rating: Unknown<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Player’s Manufacturing Item<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: When the player approaches it within 5 meters, the box opens and 3,000 ‘Poisonous Bugs’ are released. Regardless of your defense power, you will be counted as killed unconditionally when you are shot ten times.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This is actually a booby wrap.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Someone left behind a terrible gift, knowing that the World Tree camp would search the wreckage of the ship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They can kill us regardless of our defense power? Man, this is the worst gift!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fortunately, the object was hidden in the deepest part of the ship. In order to cause great damage, they hid it there, so Sungwoo’s party could find it later, not early on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After Sungwoo evacuated all the players, he dispatched the skeletons to pull out the box.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, he made sure no players should approach it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is virtually like terrorism against us. If I hadn’t noticed it, many villagers could have died.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was deep anger on Jisu’s face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo said coldly, “Let’s return the box to them because we haven’t opened it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She was embarrassed because Sungwoo clearly wanted to counterattack the enemy with terrorism.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo continued with a hardened expression, “If we don’t kill them now, somebody else could be killed. By the way, how can we find the enemy?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were determined to fight, but they could not know their opponent. If Sungwoo had watched their memory fragments, he would have solved the problem, but unfortunately, the heads of the corpses were cut off completely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, someone came to his mind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo immediately looked back at Kyongsu and said, “Kyongsu, please contact Hunter Company. If you tell them you need to ask them a favor, they will accept it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Hunter Company was very friendly to Sungwoo because their leader was Sungwoo’s hardcore fan. So, he would accept any request from Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay. Actually, I’ve been in contact with them. What do you want me to tell them?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I need to find someone. Oh, please tell them it’s not a human, but White Werewolf.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If the White Werewolf had the ‘psychometry’ ability to read the memories of objects and connect with their minds, he would be able to read information from the beheaded corpses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? Who is that Werewolf?” Kyongsu asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He did not know the White Werewolf’s capabilities because he had never seen it before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Sungwoo said briefly, looking up at the sailboat. “It is a hunting dog that will catch the intruder.” </div><h2 id="chapter293">Chapter 293</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Hey, Johnny, Johnny, come to your senses, man! Wake up!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Under the flickering lights, Jonathan Cage opened his eyes slowly. His vision was blurred.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He struggled to trace his memory. What happened? What happened to the airship, Messenger, and the crew?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, Johnny, how come you look so miserable as the hero of Central Park? You look like a Doberman who has just come out of neutering surgery.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, Parker…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan recognized the man named Parker in the blurry vision. He was a brown-haired, white man and first mate. Robin Parker used to be Jonathan’s direct subordinate right before the airship crashed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He gave Johanhan a solemn salute.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Right, Captain! Haha, we have finally come to communicate with each other,” Robin said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was a lot of ridicule in his tone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did you betray me? Why?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan was the head of the 1st External Affairs Team WPU as well as the captain of the Messenger. As a level 19 rock-type wizard, he was quite a strong man.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, he had no choice but to be helplessly exposed to the sudden attack of his betrayers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Betrayal? Well, you can talk about betrayal only on the assumption we were in the same boat, but we never shared our hearts with you from the beginning.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chuckling at him, Parker tapped Jonathan on the cheek.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, this is an operation. We’ve carried it out so well that even James Bond would envy us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, Parker stood, “Okay, to sum up, I don’t know what Chairman Love is thinking about, but it seems he is trying to get along with the master of this small land, but Admiral Baker disagrees with him. He seems to be interested in decorating an oriental garden these days. So…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way! Are you now aiming for the world tree?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, bingo.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The reason Jonathan came here with the airship Messenger was that some people disagreed he wanted to build a friendly relationship with the Necromancer by contacting him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, Chairman Love, the head of the WPU organization, greatly appreciated the worth of the hero of this Asian land. He repeatedly said that the Necromancer did not fall under the control of the Absolute Race like they had and that he even confronted the Absolute Race, so he would be the key player in the reconstruction of the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, there were also people who disagreed with the chairman within the WPU. They were hardliners led by Admiral William Baker.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Paker, is Admiral Baker trying to cause a useless sacrifice again this time? Are you indulging in that ridiculous heroism, too?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Johnny! This is not heroism, man. You also saw that terrible world tree, didn’t you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hope you don’t think the world tree is just an ordinary shade tree. It’s like a weapon of mass destruction buried somewhere in the desert in the Middle East. If you squat in front of that and recite the Quran, it will surely fly up, destroying Washington D.C. like a Lego block,” Parker said as if appealing to him with his arms wide open. “Hey friend, we’ve always blocked the upcoming disasters at the risk of ourselves. And this is part of such efforts.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>All the players from the US military under Admiral Baker still believed that the U.S. had to take the lead in solving all the problems. Therefore, they regarded the alien power as a “potential threat” that would harm the US-centered world order and boldly eliminated them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan shook his head and said, “Parker, that’s not true…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Parker rejected him and said, “And the crash of the Messenger will be a catalyst.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He continued with a proud expression, “You and the Messenger will be known to have been brutally slaughtered by the exclusive Asian terrorist, and Admiral Baker will be supported by the Provisional Congress. Then, the Dwarfs will send us a fleet.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan shook his head again because he imagined the scene of the WPU’s Dwarf Fleet crossing the Pacific Ocean and bombing the world tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And that wasn’t the absolute path for peace.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please think carefully…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Parker’s eyes turned to the ceiling. He frowned and gazed at the corners of the flickering lights, where two vague objects were floating.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was obviously a ghost. Parker didn’t know why the ghost was here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly, an explosion broke out above his head. With a roar tearing his eardrum, he squatted down helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan, a rock-type wizard, cast magic on the falling concrete even though he was trapped, forming a round dome shape to protect his and Parker’s heads. If not, both of them would have been fatally injured.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Cough! Cough! What the heck is this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Parker climbed out of the dome and raised his head to check the situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Faint light and an unidentified black smoke penetrated through the rubble.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Parker instinctively covered his mouth and nose.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! Check the inside!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sailor! Are you okay?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He heard his subordinates shouting at him nearby. Fortunately, not all of them were not buried.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right at that moment, the debris blocking the concrete above their heads was lifted and light poured in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Parker doubted my eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A giant hand made of bones was lifting a handful of debris. As if he felt like an ant in a burrowed anthill, Parker crouched.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’ve found them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>An unfamiliar voice rang above his head, and soon someone jumped down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was an Asian man wearing a dark green robe. A few more people came down after him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even if he didn’t confirm them, Parker immediately realized that they were the players of the World Tree camp. If that was the case, it meant that the famous Necromancer also came here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How did you know we were here?” Parker asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But no one answered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, Jonathan? You are Jonathan, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was Kyongsu’s voice. He recognized Jonathan right away, the leader of the 1st External Affairs Team, whom he had met several times. Given that Jonathan was tied up in chains, Kyongsu could grasp the situation to some extent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He’s that man over there!” said the White Werewolf, who was standing at the back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He lifted his long finger and pointed at Parker.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That white man took the initiative in slaughtering the sailors on the ship.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He succeeded in reading the memories contained in the corpses and objects through his ‘psychometry’ ability and chased them in this place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? How could you say that so confidently?” Parker asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Parker panicked, but he did not lose his composure. Since he served in the military as a US Navy sergeant for a long time, he was sort of immune to this kind of dangerous situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, I don’t know why you guys stormed into my place so roughly, but I thought FBI agents chased me here! As intellectuals, we can talk with each other nicely, can’t we?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Parker stepped forward, pretending to be calm. Then, he faced the Necromancer, Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Park said nothing. The situation was clearly unfavorable to him. He and his men were only a small number here, and this place was far from their home base.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, he knew that if he lost a war of nerves with the enemy, his value as a prisoner of war would go down, so he didn’t try to be subservient to the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, look here. You know this guy, Jonathan Cage. He went to meet you on our behalf, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shrugging proudly, Parker stepped closer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You know what? There was a rebellion led by this guy, Jonathan. It’s hard for me to explain this because it’s a complicated family feud, but we were interrogating him to find out what the plan was after subduing their revolt.” </div><h2 id="chapter294">Chapter 294</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Parker grabbed Jonathan by the shoulder, who was tied to his chair and looked into Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Although our diplomatic meeting with you was postponed for inevitable reasons, we really hope you can understand we want a friendly relationship with you…Kheeeeeeek!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He could not use his cunning trick any longer because Sungwoo threw his right hand, grabbed his neck, and lifted him off the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo shouted, “Why are you talking so much?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kheeeeek! Kuuuuuk!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It looks like you are mistaken a lot, but do you think I’m here for a diplomatic dialogue with you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ka…heeek…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think you already know about me, don’t you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo threw Parker to the floor violently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His shoulder blades were fractured after being thrown down to the concrete. As if his spine was cracked, he felt a sharp pang in his lower body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t stop there. He approached Parker and crushed his knee with his foot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crunchy!<br/><br/><br/><br/>His knees bent like sorghum straw. Parker couldn’t even scream because of immense pain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He just scratched the floor so hard, groaning in extreme pain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As you know well, I’m just an exclusive terrorist, so I just want to cruelly slaughter those foreigners who have come to our land. That’s my hobby.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said so, Sungwoo laughed heartily. Of course, that’s what Parker told Jonathan just a little while ago.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a matter of fact, Sungwoo was listening to their conversation through the ghosts attached to the wall, namely the two Spectors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Isn’t this the scenario you wanted, right?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Parker shook his head in a nerve-burning pain, shedding tears.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t be ridiculous! You won’t get anything by torturing me like this. I’m a soldier of the United States.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the iron gate collapsed, which was standing intact despite the collapse of the building. And, a woman with a sword appeared behind it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ve killed all of them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She was Jisu. She stood next to Sungwoo, wiping off the blood on her sword. Drops of blood she wiped off fell over Parker’s face.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Whatever you do, it’s useless. I’m not going to tell you anything. Don’t waste your time. You had better kill me quickly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though his spine was fractured and his knees broken, Parker was not ready to give up, with strong resolve on his face. He was a strong soldier full of patriotism. So, he was confident that he would not succumb to any torture.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo smiled at him scornfully.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m sorry, but I don’t do anything like torture.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What did you say?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you think I’ve found out about this place by torturing somebody?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Parker’s face was covered with something. It was a mask. Parker smelled the blood around his mouth and heard the voice of the Necromancer ringing from somewhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“And I won’t even kill you. From now on, it is you guys who are going to be used in this political fight, not us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Parker never gave in, but he couldn’t shake off the anxiety that he was captured by the wrong person.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I won’t kill you, but you’ll be remembered as the worst soldier in your proud homeland.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The place where Parker and his party were hiding was the basement of Sanghyeon Station in Yongin City. Sungwoo’s party came out of the rubble and was cleaning up at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is an object we have found inside.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The search team members came out with a large case. Sungwoo stepped back and made a skeleton open because he did not rule out the possibility that it might be a trap, like the “player killer box” found on a crashed airship in the past.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nothing unusual is inside.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fortunately, no accident happened. When Sungwoo approached and checked it, there was an orange sphere inside the case. There were a total of 4 inside it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This must be the core part that was in the engine compartment, right?” asked Kyongsu, who was looking at it, standing next to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think so.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The engineers who searched the airship said they found traces of missing important parts in the engine compartment. And when they checked the plane, the parts that supplied the ship with power were missing. Sungwoo felt these parts were the power source.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo put his hand on the part.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Airship engine core type-3 (flying seat)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Class: Unknown<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Player Manufacturing Item<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Injecting mana reduces the weight of a certain volume by up to 98%, and the airship can soar into the air when injecting mana once more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: This model is equipped with an ‘amplifier’ that amplifies the effect of weight reduction of the general flying seat by 300%.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*This item is a valuable property of the W·P·U, regarded as top-secret and needs top security management. Those except for authorized people are strictly prohibited from controlling it. (Manufacturer’s direct description)<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to the description, when they attach this item to the engine, the weight of such a huge sailing ship will be reduced by more than 98%, making it easier to soar into the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, the airship would need other propulsion or steering gear, but just reducing its weight would make the whole process much easier.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Keep this well.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Werewolf Skeleton put the case inside the backpack. If Sungwoo returned the skeleton to the “Void Haven” in this state, he would not have to worry about losing the parts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was obvious that the W·P·U cherished them a lot, but Sungwoo had no intention of returning them once he obtained them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hanho was healing the wounds of that black guy named Jonathan Cage by healing him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, you were a priest, right?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bet. Actually, I forgot it, but just remembered it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sitting on the rubble, Sungwoo looked at Jonathan. When he overheard the conversation through the Spectors in the past, Sungwoo knew he was friendly to the World Tree camp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why did you come as far as here from America? Don’t talk bullshit like forging a friendly relationship with us. Just tell me the real reason.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo asked, Jonathan was tight-lipped for some time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But when Sungwoo kept staring at him, he had no choice but to open his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The US server is somewhat stable.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s why you guys have taken the liberty of coming to the Korean server.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan raised his head and said, “But they are not in South America.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“South America? Which one is it? Brazil?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Specifically, the Amazon area.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tropical rainforest, the Amazon, was often called the lungs of the Earth. What happened to it?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The Amazon is so vast and rugged that the players on the Brazilian server wouldn’t have been able to use it freely.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I see…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo understood at once what he was trying to say. Just as the king of monsters appeared in Mt. Taebaek, and the king of the monsters on the North Korean server, monsters in the neglected the Amazon would have gone through evolution until now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, those who evolved in the Amazon were likely to be much more powerful than those in Mt. Taebaek or on the North Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Amazon was one of the deepest and largest unknown lands in the world, so it was a space that was out of the reach of the players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Monsters born there are threatening the North American continent. In the end, we believe that it will be difficult for us to stop them with our strength, so we hope we can form a global alliance to unite to confront the Amazon monsters.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t think all the guys in your group want it, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan nodded bitterly and said, “After our group has become stable to some extent, there has broken out a power struggle and secret strife among us.” </div><h2 id="chapter295">Chapter 295</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>According to Jonathan, an old man named Chairman Love showed leadership in bringing several organizations together to create one large organization called WPU.<br/><br/><br/><br/>WPU succeeded in stabilizing the eastern part of the United States, but they were faced with the next big problem.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The problem was that Chairman Love had strong leadership, but he didn’t have the overwhelming force to back up his leadership.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a time when the individual’s forces could destroy a large organization. So, those strong men craving for power could not sit idle, doing anything to challenge his leadership.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the end, there was a sharp, invisible conflict within the WPU.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think the news of the crash of the Messenger and their fabricated report must have already been conveyed to the leadership of the WPU. Even though Chairman Love and his aides are still in firm control, this kind of false news will have a big impact on the Congress’ decision.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you mean they can attack us?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s exactly what Admiral Baker, who made up this plan, wants. I’m sure he has already started agitating and persuading Congress. Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Hanho was done healing him, Jonathan was stabilized much more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But his expression got harder and harder.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He suddenly stood up from his seat and said, “Thank you for your help. However, even in this worst case, there is nothing I can do to contact the WPU leadership.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How about accessing the US server community using a mobile phone? Can’t you get through to them?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan shook his head calmly and said, “Soon after they launched the raid, they collected all cell phones that could access the US server community and destroyed them. Even if we get a new cell phone, it’s useless unless we can scan the QR code drawn on American soil.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo instructed the search team to check if there was any cell phone on the enemy’s bodies, but no cell phone was found like Jonathan said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Parker and his subordinates also destroyed their cell phones in case of this kind of situation. They had been planning this for a long time, so they must have thought of almost all the potential outcomes.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan shook his head while sweeping his face with his large hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He seemed to be trying to be calm, but he suddenly expressed frustration.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can you go to America if we can get you a plane?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He shook his head at Sungwoo’s suggestion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, you can’t cross the Pacific Ocean with any ordinary plane because it can’t withstand strange magic storms and monster attacks. That’s why we needed the Messenger. Since it was completely destroyed, it won’t be able to function unless the WPU engineers fix it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, he squatted down on the concrete debris.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo said something, and he sprang to his feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re now fixing the Messenger.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head and looked at Kyongsu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kyongsu, how long will it take to fix the sailboat?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, it won’t take that long. I hear that they’re going to fix it by tomorrow morning.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Jonathan looked surprised.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He said, “No, you can’t fix it here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Because it requires a lot of magic engineering skills.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded, then turned around, spitting out, “Our technical prowess is considerable!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Given that they built such a huge airship, Sungwoo realized that the WPU engineers’ technology was amazing. However, Suwon village, the hometown of the World Tree camp, also had a group of engineers with considerable technical skills. Many engineering students devoted themselves to the research and development of all kinds of weapons, based on the overflowing materials and gold with the blessings of the world tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What do you think? It’s enchanted wood, but its durability is good, isn’t it? There is no regenerative power at all, so it looks like they don’t know how to mix the troll blood.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, who would think of mixing troll blood with something like brick or wood? As you know, we also didn’t know anything about it until some crazy guy painted with it, thinking it was red paint.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rather, they were ahead of the WPU engineers in some respects.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It looks like there was a shield, but it doesn’t seem to have been hung on the hull itself.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, it looks like it’s coming out of some sort of engine inside. Hey, Team No. 2, go in and check the internal facilities again. ”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, just repairing the exterior of the airship wasn’t all they had to fix.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It seems that they intentionally destroyed the engine and steering gear as well. Obviously, they intended to disable the airship.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But we can fix these kinds of problems easily. They should have burned it if they wanted to disable it. How stupid they are!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Repairing the airship Messenger was not an impossible task. The engineers of Suwon village analyzed the design of each part and succeeded in reproducing or replacing the damaged parts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They worked on it overnight, and when the next morning came, they finished the job.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One engineer shouted, “We’re done!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They completely succeeded in repairing the airship that crashed in a strange land.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they finally installed the four core type-3 engines, powerful energy circulated in the air intakes and began to encircle the hull. They were done preparing for its departure.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“15 wizards who will infuse mana are now aboard the airship. We have also succeeded in reducing the weight of the ship by injecting mana first. If we inject mana again, the airship will be able to soar into the air. Shall we start?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Kyongsu asked, Sungwoo nodded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alright. Let’s have a takeoff for a test run!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Five, four…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With everyone focusing on it, Kyongsu kept the countdown.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Three, two, one!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“First test, take off!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gooooooooooooooo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>A giant 85-meter airship slowly floated in the air. Its wild shadow slowly covered the spectators’ heads. Then, it stopped about 50 meters in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It has made a successful takeoff!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The inside of the ship is also stable, with no shaking or vibrations at all. We still have to do a little more testing, but we haven’t found any problems until now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Spectators shouted for joy everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan’s jaws dropped in surprise when he watched the whole process. He felt that the WPU engineers boasted of their superior technology in the world, but the engineers here were ahead of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I just can’t believe this…” Jonathan said, looking at Sungwo. “Who the hell are you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo replied quietly, “Look, I already told you their technical prowess is considerable!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the Messenger left America to cross the Pacific on a mission of staying on other continents for a considerable period, there was a variety of supplies on the ship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This item is…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Among them, one item caught the blacksmiths’ eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s big and beautiful!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, I’m so excited. I’m not dreaming, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a huge cannon with a 4 meter-long barrel. It was the main cannon of the Messenger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Supernatural Storm<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Legend<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Special Quest Reward<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: When you load ‘Spirit Stone’ in the magazine, you can fire a ”Spirit Bullet.’ (Once every 2 minutes)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Description: A mechanical device created by the ‘Iron Spirit’. It is compatible with the power of various spirits and can fire ‘Spirit Bullets’. The higher-level ‘Spirit Stone’ you load, the more powerful firepower you can release.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the blacksmiths had been working hard on the production of flying weapons, they had no choice but to pay attention to this huge cannon. </div><h2 id="chapter296">Chapter 296</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>“Quest reward? Are you sure? But this isn’t a player’s manufacturing item, isn’t it? If so, can’t we reverse engineer it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But the thing is somebody has made such a cannon, right? If so, why can’t we make it, too?<br/><br/><br/><br/>How about disassembling it?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you serious? Are you confident?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I have to disagree. Until you reach the ‘equipment design’ master grade, don’t even touch it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While they were in the thick of discussing how to handle it, Sungwoo came into the blacksmiths’ workshop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, you are here, Sungwoo. Take a look at this. It is a canon called ‘Supernatural Storm.’ If we have it, our defense power, as well as our ability to use flying weapons, will increase significantly. Isn’t it cool?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The blacksmith team leader spoke excitedly, so Sungwoo got also interested in the cannon because he felt the necessity of securing flying weapons such as the Iron Mace of Lightning and Fire Rocket Arrow after experiencing their enormous firepower.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What kind of features does it have?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo asked, the team leader explained each part of the cannon and opened the magazine of the cannon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“And this is the core of this mighty cannon. You don’t have to load any ammunition here. If you insert the Spirit Stone here, it creates and fires the cannon with the power of the Spirit.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he pulled out a total of three red stones from the magazine, which were “Fire Spirit Stone (lower grade).”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hum…this is a Spirit Stone?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo took out the ‘Fire Spirit Stone (high grade) that he obtained after hunting the Salamander. When he compared the two spirit stones, this one was about three times bigger than the Fire Spirit Stone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, if you put this here, is this cannon going to be stronger?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo presented the Fire Spirit Stone, it seemed they had some kind of perverted desire.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! Yeah, hand it to me right away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can we experiment with it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It only takes a moment for us to experiment with it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They shouted at Sungwoo at the same time, and he gave them the Fire Spirit Stone (higher grade).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, an intense heat soared from the thermal power experiment site outside the village with a roaring sound of explosions. Even though it was more than 2 kilometers away from the village, they could feel the vibrations through the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly afterward, the blacksmiths with a lot of soot on their faces rushed to Sungwoo with a toothy smile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s a jackpot! With this firepower, we can even break through the shield the same size as the Messenger and shoot it down with one stroke. What a jackpot!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I would say it’s a really artistic explosion! We have blown away a five-story building with this. I wish you had seen it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sensing that they got completely carried away with the firepower of the Fire Spirit Stone, he just nodded at their words calmly instead of responding.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good. Nice job.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the Fire Spirit Stone (higher grade) was an item he obtained after hunting an emperor-grade monster, even the WPU of the US server would not be able to bring firepower as massive as this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Jonathan came to Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Necromancer…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although he called Sungwoo, Sungwoo did not look at him with a nonchalant expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Jonathan made a desperate expression as if to ask him a favor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was not the first time he asked Sungwoo a favor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Please! Please return the Messenger to me!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the Messenger started functioning again thanks to the hard work of the engineers of the World Tree camp, Jonathan said he would go back to the US server on the Messenger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He said needed to go back as soon as possible to stop Admiral Baker from taking control of the Congress of the WPU and stop their ambition to try and conquer the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo refused his request without any hesitation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Give it back? To whom?” Sungwoo replied with an annoyed expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan cautiously expressed his opinion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As you have saved me, I’m sorry to tell you this, but the Messenger is the property of the WPU as described in the ship’s information.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that point, Sungwoo stared at Jonathan intensely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Property? Don’t you think you use that word too easily? You can talk about your property under the common system recognized by society as a whole. How can you claim it as your property in this crazy world?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan was embarrassed by Sungwoo’s criticism.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo continued, “We found some of these enormous items which were partially destroyed, so we repaired them by ourselves, and we captured some others from the enemy. Which part of the Messenger you believe is the property of the WPU? Do you think we took this ship from you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo took a step closer to him and said in a much softer voice, “Now, let me make it clear to you. The WPU is not my enemy, right? They are your enemy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan nodded and said without any hesitation, “Yes, of course.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“And the invaders we fought against yesterday didn’t represent the WPU, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are the betrayers of the WPU. Believe me! They have never been affiliated with the WPU.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo smiled at him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Jonathan felt he made a mistake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s right. We won by fighting the invaders who were trying to occupy our land and our lives then obtained the legitimate spoils. That’s all.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan couldn’t respond at all when Sungwoo made conclusive remarks like that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan’s argument was poor. He just appealed to Sungwoo emotionally, saying he lost the Messenger unfairly, but he didn’t come up with any legitimate reason for getting the Messenger back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the other hand, the World Tree camp, like Sungwoo said, beat the invaders and obtained their possessions. They didn’t even touch the possessions of the WPU.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jonathan, you’re not trying to claim ownership by morality or law in a crazy world like this, right? Think about it carefully. If you claim the Messenger, your thinking is neither civilized nor wise. It’s anachronistic and old-fashioned.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then Sungwoo turned away coldly, “Ah…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan looked at him blankly, and muttered to himself, “You are right. But Chairman Love hopes that it’s possible to take back a normal world, and that’s why I came…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it seemed too early. Maybe it would be an eternal ideal because the world was too barbaric for them to create a human society.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, we need you all the more, Necromancer.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ironically, there had to be someone who could face the barbaric world in a barbaric way in order to rebuild civilization.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But even Chairman Love, who Jonathan trusted and followed, wasn’t a good person.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, they lived in an era of uncertainty, a time when unexpected things happened when they woke up the next day.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo! Sungwoo!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was turmoil early in the morning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Sungwoo rushed into the room at Hanho’s shouting, Mir, who was sleeping, tossed and turned, throwing a tantrum.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the door opened and Hanho came in, holding a cell phone in one hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Startled, Mir raised his head buried under the pillow. At the same time, Mir summoned two chicken skeletons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahh! What the heck is this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo kicked a chicken skeleton running towards Hanho and threw it against the wall before sitting down at the chair.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, they just tried to kill me, right? I’ve eaten numerous chickens until now, but I haven’t thought about getting killed by a chicken.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, what’s going on?” </div><h2 id="chapter297">Chapter 297</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>After checking Mir’s condition, Hanho approached Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While groaning a bit, Mir buried his head again under the pillow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my…some airships appeared on the south coast. After he checked the airships, Jonathan said they seemed to be the WPU fleet.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They came here already? WPF fleet?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The situation was more dangerous and urgent than he thought. This time Jonathan came to Sungwoo and explained in more detail.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The airships appeared briefly on the Korean server’s broadcast, and I’m sure they are WPU fleet. While I was here, Admiral Baker took control of the Provisional Council and obtained the right to wage a war.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Frustration spread over his face. Admiral Baker’s forces were operating in a far more organized manner than he thought. Even if Sungwoo had returned the Messenger to him, he would not have stopped them from dispatching the naval fleet here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But how come they have arrived so early like this? They can’t cross the Pacific Ocean overnight, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It has been less than three days since the news about the crash of the Messenger in Korea was delivered to the US server. While it was possible for them to control the Temporary Congress during that time, they could not reach the Korean server during that time span.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is this an item?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously, they didn’t cross the Pacific Ocean to come here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I guess so. I think they have used something called a ‘server jumper’.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to Jonathan, there was a special weapon called the “server jumper” among the items developed by the Dwarves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was literally something that could move at once, as if jumping between the servers, but to put it simply, it was better than the “Hyper Gate” used by the Kyushu Union Army in Japan previously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In order to open the ‘Hyper Gate’, they had to install it first by penetrating their arrival point in advance. However, Jonathan said that the portal would open as soon as they put the mark on the map without going through such a cumbersome process.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s a top-notch security item even within the WPU, too, and judging that they used it, it would be reasonable to think Admiral Baker’s forces have taken full control of all power beyond the Provisional Congress. They have been preparing carefully for a long time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While saying so, Jonathan looked at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Though Sungwoo looked calm, it seemed that he made up his mind about something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He slowly opened his mouth, “Whatever it is, the WPU is our enemy.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan sighed at his words and said, “Anyway, all this happened because we couldn’t stop it. So, please beat them, so they will come back to their senses once again.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>please overcome it. So that I can get their act together.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo stood up from the chair and said, “I can beat them, but I can’t guarantee they will go back safely.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The World Tree camp held a strategy meeting. Each team leader gathered in the conference room.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is a videotape of the broadcast that was aired three hours ago. The place is Changwon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Kyungsoo said that, a video appeared on the screen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thump- thump-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The video was filmed inside a building with a clear view of the south coast amid a roaring sound.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Huge objects floated at regular intervals between the sea and the blue sky. They were not something like an island. They were airships.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What you see on the screen are seven airships right now.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What came next was the scenes of the airships bombing a group of survivors on the southern coast. All sorts of flying weapons on the seven airships fired cannons, and the buildings along the coast collapsed like sandcastles. It was an indiscriminate bombing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, there were lots of players inside the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Because the airship launched a surprise attack, the players had no time to evacuate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their screams rang endlessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the video was over, Kyungsoo first opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, watching the video, we can find out that Admiral Baker’s purpose is not simply to hit us, the World Tree camp, but to take control of the whole Korean server.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Inho replied, nodding at his words, “They know that if they can beat the World Tree camp, the entire Korean server falls into their hands.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, each team leader began to give their opinions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, I just wonder why they attacked the southern area first before coming directly to Suwon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are now holding their heads high because of their victory in the south. Doesn’t it mean that they think they can win without launching a surprise attack?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Good for them. If they have decided to move up from the south, we have plenty of time to prepare for the onslaught. We have completed the new wall, and produced lots of flying weapons, too. So, by the time they reach here, we will be able to attack them. I think we can make seven more airships on this occasion.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Jonathan, who was watching the meeting from the back, interrupted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, I’m sorry, but they are not all the WPU fleet. They must be the advance party.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having said that, Jonathan looked at Sungwoo, who, in turn, nodded at him, so he could explain in more detail.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The purpose of the advance team is to lay the groundwork for their main unit to land.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The item called ‘Server Jumper’ that I mentioned earlier is highly effective, but it would not have been able to move the entire fleet. But if the advance party brought a few “Hyper Gates” here, they could open more portals .”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Jonathan finished talking, Inho wrapped his head with his hands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, that’s why they landed on the southern coast, not Suwon… Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His frustration represented the feelings of everyone sitting here. Their heads were spinning like a top at the moment. After all, Hyper Gates was the problem!<br/><br/><br/><br/>By now, the advance party must be busy installing Hyper Gates to have more troops land here, and their fleets would multiply in a few hours.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Once again, I would like to emphasize that Admiral Baker’s army is quite strong. They can smash an army of 20,000 Iron Orcs into ashes in just a few minutes….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan sighed, recalling his old memories.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I still can’t forget that terrible thing. Winning the battle unilaterally is their specialty.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With his fingers interlocked, Sungwoo looked at him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment Jonathan met Sungwoo’s eyes, he could guess how Sungwoo was trying to respond. He recalled what Sungwoo told him in a confident voice only recently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo slowly opened his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As I told you before, our strength is also huge.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then Sungwoo stood up and said, “It will take time for the enemy to install the ‘Hyper Gates’ for large-scale space movement. But they won’t have little time to do so.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head to Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, did you hear anything from the King of the Great Mountain?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu nodded. As a matter of fact, she sent a message to the king at his request.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He decided to give you a stone for space movement. Instead, he forced us to buy 1000 sacks of potatoes they grew by themselves, saying we could trade them for other food.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It seemed that the king and his men were finally sick and tired of potatoes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyway, Sungwoo succeeded in getting a space movement stone from the king.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This space movement stone does not require installation but allows a small number of people to move freely within the same server. Although only a few of us can go, we can go straight to Changwon where the enemy fleet has landed.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kyungsoo laughed at his words and responded, “Well, our small elite force is far from small.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everybody in the conference room except for Jonathan looked relaxed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Jonathan still had a hard time understanding this atmosphere. </div><h2 id="chapter298">Chapter 298</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>At Jinhae Port in Changwon City.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was the place where a group of survivors belonging to the ‘Hwarang Guild’ lived until this morning. During the Korean and Japanese war, they didn’t suffer any direct damage from the Japanese troops that landed on the Korean server, so they were thriving on a solid foundation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, this place turned into ashes.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they looked down from the WPU airship in the air, Jinhae port was completely ruined.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since seven airships fired all sorts of magic shells like rain, it was natural that the port was devastated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What a spectacle!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two men were standing on the deck of Vanguard, No. 4 warship of the Baker Fleet. Leaning against the railing, they watched the ruined port city.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bet! It’s so spectacular that nothing has survived.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, isn’t it your first time to see something like this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I experienced it in Philadelphia.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, Philadelphia…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two men chuckled at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our admiral hoped this kind of spectacle could be broadcast on the Korean server to break their spirits, right? Other than that, it’s just unbelievable for us to pour out shells here instead of on the monsters.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You’re right. Admiral Baker, you know, looks like a performance artist. Don’t you think this kind of performance is also sort of a strategy?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Philadelphia?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They laughed again. It seemed that they had some special memories in Philadelphia.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, that’s why we devastated Philadelphia because Chairman Love accused him of causing an unnecessary sacrifice. What did he say? Didn’t he say that it was because of the indiscriminate bombing that the Philadelphia Alliance surrendered early? He even said Admiral Baker traded shells for the lives of soldiers.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did Admiral Baker major in psychology?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He’s an old man who was mistaken that he could get the psychological analysis of his men. But look what happened? Since the world has changed like this, doesn’t it seem that everybody tends to believe him?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Right. I hear that the sailors on the ship call him Odin with two eyes open. I knew that someday he would beat Chairman Love and become the top leader, but I never expected the day would come so early when he took control like this.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As their conversation suggested, the Provisional Congress already fell into the hands of Admiral Baker.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The crash of the Messenger and the slaughter of the crew on the airship made a big impact. Everyone knew that the Necromancer was a crazy wizard who controlled corpses, but who knew he was a barbarian psychopath who we could not even talk with?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, that’s what the lawmakers who supported Chairman Love didn’t know. That’s why they supported Admiral Baker without knowing the exact situation. As a matter of fact, they gave up the hope that Chairman Love’s troops were a reinforcement who would alleviate their anxiety about the monsters coming from Amazon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, the wrong news seemed to have changed the atmosphere of the Provisional Congress.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sipping tea, they clicked their tongues.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, by the way, I hear that there are about 6 hours left until they are done installing the Hyper Gate. I wonder if we can take a break until then.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, if you listen to the guys on the ship, they might attack Busan, too…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a shadow quickly passed over the deck. The two raised their heads at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did you see that a moment ago?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seeing a shadow wasn’t common. Unless it was a cloud, nothing could pass over their heads, and the clouds would not pass so quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Look over there!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they looked at the far end of the horizon, something with wings disappeared through the clouds at a tremendous speed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But even before they thought about the identity of the unidentified flying object, they were distracted by another object.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly, a square box fell on the deck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Player Killer Box’ opens!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God! This one is…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They immediately noticed what it was. It was a surprise box containing hundreds of “extremely poisonous worms,” which was called a “Player Killer Box” (extremely poisonous insects), an inhumane killing weapon that the Provisional Congress banned them from using.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But such an object fell right under their feet, which was something very ominous.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re finished!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeing!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, the four corners of the box opened with a mechanical sound, and a swarm of black smoke-like insects began to pour out. They began to squeeze through the cracks in the airship. The two could not stop the killer insects.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the airship shook violently as if it had had a seizure.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was watching the whole scene of the Player Killer Box opening from a distance through the Specter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hmm…the box has completely swallowed up a sailing boat.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ‘Player Killer Box (venomous insects)’ could not be stopped once it was opened, and it could be opened only when the player approached it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After Sungwoo discovered the object, he had the undead hold it so as to stop it from working, which was kept by them until now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo now counterattcked them with the killer box.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. I have no reason to fight them moderately.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>They lost a whole airship and many crew members because of Sungwoo’s unexpected attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the other airships began to evade. They ran away from the airship full of killer bugs as if they fled from those struck by a plague.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Great! We’ve secured one more airship!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, it seemed that they didn’t want to give up the airship easily, so they fled from the airship far away with small flying objects being separated from the fleet. They looked like an emergency boat, but fire-type wizards wearing protective clothing were aboard the flying objects. Were they assigned to taking care of the killer bug box?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, they can’t easily throw away the ship they like so much, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, after a while, they turned the course again, helplessly returning to the fleet in despair.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, they began to shout in embarrassment here and there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s an enemy fleet! The enemy fleet has appeared!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo also turned his head. Black figures were approaching from the inland sky. They were none other than dozens of Bone Wyverns and the Messenger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A large-scale air battle between Sungwoo’s allies and Admiral Baker’s fleet began on the sea off Changwon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everybody, get ready for the battle! A fleet of the World Tree camp has appeared from the north! Everybody, get back to your position!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the broadcast rang with the siren, the WPU fleet began to be busy. The sailors on the ship conveyed orders and the engine room continued to run the ship at high speed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if they were familiar with this kind of operation, all the airships moved in unison.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The six airships fired huge cannons and formed an artillery line.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Align the entire muzzles and stand by!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players on the ‘gun deck’ were taking their breath, pointing their guns to the enemy fleet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their subordinates stared at the enemy with telescopes in silence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck? Wyvern? That’s a Wyvern made of bones, right? Are they flying here to attack us?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the subordinate shooters sneered at the Wyverns and handed the telescope to the chief shooter. The chief shooter’s reaction was also no different.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Insane guys, they are coming for suicide!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They lost one airship, but they were still elated with high morale<br/><br/><br/><br/>Most of the soldiers of the Baker fleet were former soldiers, obeying the admiral’s absolute orders, and winning victory after victory. And they were virtually responsible for the creation of the WPU, the core group of the eastern United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, how come they dare to attack us like that? Are they crazy? Don’t those barbarians have no sense of art at all?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They mocked the approaching Wyverns and Sungwoo’s troops.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahaha! It looks like we have to smash them to pieces.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just a few hours ago they devastated Jinhae Port beyond recognition, so they were confident of turning a dozen winged bones into ashes at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everybody, shut up! We have an order!” </div><h2 id="chapter299">Chapter 299</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>When the gunnery officer shouted, those on the deck were quiet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But soon somebody asked mischievously, “Hey, manager! So, what is the client’s request?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The gunnery officer opened his mouth with a stern expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, he has ordered us to begin the attack as soon as inspiration comes to our mind!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>A peal of laughter burst out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, those on the ‘superstructure deck’ were also busy. A number of combat troops were preparing for an unexpected situation. Their mission was to block the enemy by spamming attack magic when they approached, and going one step further, they should also prepare for a hand-to-hand fight just in case by getting on the deck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that? Shadow?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What made them so embarrassed was the shadow cast on the deck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But this time the shadow didn’t pass by quickly. It got bigger and bigger and covered the deck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was the outright approach of the shadow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s over our heads!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Above their heads came down a pair of huge wings. They were an exceptionally large Bone Wyvern and Bone Wyvern Alpha Male. The enemy was about to attack them over their heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Prepare the freezing magic!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do not panic! They can’t penetrate our shield anyway!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>All ships were covered with powerful shields. So, they couldn’t jump off the deck. If somebody threw himself without knowing anything, he would slide and fall into the sea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The troops on the deck were on standby just in case.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everyone, save mana! If they are stupid enough to touch the shields, we’re going to smash them to pieces!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But their expectations were wrong.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A large cannon mounted on the back of Bone Wyvern Alpha Male fired. A beam of flames struck the ship’s shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The shield was crushed with one stroke, shaking the deck. The deck soldiers lost their balance and fell. Then, the enormous heat that melted the shield came down, burning their faces and necks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! What the hell did they fire?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a ‘Supernatural Storm’ equipped with a ‘Fire Spirit Stone (advanced)’. Contrary to the blacksmith’s expectations, the cannon could not crash the airship with a single stroke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, it did its job nicely by breaking through the shield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>– Caution! The ‘Fellblade’ has started in the affected area.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this message?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Along with a messenger that the players on the US server had never seen before, black smoke rose from the wings of the enormous shields above their heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first, they thought it was just a dark cloud.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, God…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the undead army began to pour down onto the deck like a waterfall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the shield was gone, they could not attack the enemy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The panicked players were crushed to death by huge skeletons falling from the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They covered the superstructure deck in an instant. Then, they squeezed themselves into the cabin, went down the stairs, and began to occupy the airship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their ambush was an unexpected development, and it happened in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since they had little time to grasp the situation, the order from their superior was delivered belatedly. So, the players onboard were kept in the dark about what’s going on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You heard something like an impact, right? What was it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even the gunnery players on the deck were sitting blankly, aiming at the approaching Bone Wyvern.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We have received no orders yet.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If there was anything different now, they didn’t smile anymore. Tight-lipped, they listened for the strange noises coming from above their heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the horrible rocking noise got closer and closer, someone left the place and quietly stood. His action was a violation of the rules, but no one stopped him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He slowly approached the door.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, the door broke, and white demons poured in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In contrast to the gray ruins that they left behind in Jinhae Port, another work of intense red was born.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The flagship “Bird of Washington” led by Admiral William Baker of the WPU was shrouded in silence. There was only the screaming of the signal officer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Blue Wing! Respond! Respond!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, all he heard from the radio item was a miscellaneous signal. He could not make any contact with the players on the airship that they had dealt with the enemy’s intrusion and reported back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“There is no answer from them.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ‘Blue Wing,’ the 3rd airship, as seen from the flagship, broke away from the line of battle and gradually sailed backward. But it looked as if the airship was sinking into the sea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The massive Bone Wyvern that hit the Blue Wing was expelled by its shielding, but only after a significant number of undead troops invaded the ship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nobody could figure out what kind of terrible things were going on inside the ship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With everybody silent amid restlessness, Admiral William Baker, in his late 60s, was resting his chin on his hand with a calm expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? The Blue Wing is moving again!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The altitude of the Blue Wing, which was slowly sinking as if drifting, was up a bit. That meant that somebody was doing it manually.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ll try to contact them again!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the signals officer said, the admiral’s eyes wriggled a little, but still, he looked like a relaxed old man keeping an eye on a rye field.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he slowly fixed his posture and spit out a command in a slow tone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shoot it down.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Pardon? Shoot down the Blue Wing?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the admiral ordered, all the crew members of the flagship turned around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first, they could not believe their ears.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even if they allowed the enemy to intrude into the ship, how could he sacrifice the precious airship and the lives of dozens of crew members on the Blue Wing?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When all the crew hesitated, Admiral Baker’s eyebrows wriggled twice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He typically showed that body gesture when he was displeased with something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shoot it down before I shoot you in the head right now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His tone was still slow, but there was a murderous intent in it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, all the crew looked at the Blue Wing and began to carry out the order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This is an order to all the battleships! Fire and shoot down the Blue Wing…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it was too late. Suddenly, the Blue Wing’s muzzles tilted and began to fire.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Four shells hit the No. 2 ship, floating right next to the flagship. The lower deck was crushed, with the pieces of wood fluttering everywhere like autumn leaves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, what the heck?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>No. 2 ship lost its track, tilting before colliding with No. 6 right beside it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two ships broke away from the line of battle and started drifting back a few dozen meters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everyone on the flagship was so shocked that they could not think straight. What the heck happened? How come the Blue Wing was attacking their friendly forces?<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Admiral Baker raised his hand for the first time. Then, he loaded one of the four rifles behind his back. At the same time, the signal officer, who stopped while conveying the admiral’s order to fire, was shot through his head. When he fell, with his head slamming against the dashboard, the crew member next to him immediately picked up the radio.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“All the battleships! Bombard the Blue Wing!” </div><h2 id="chapter300">Chapter 300</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>As soon as the order was conveyed, the remaining five battleships poured shells at the Blue Wing. As a result of the ruthless bombing, the Blue Wing lost its balance and began to sink into the sea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Blue Wing is sinking!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With such heavy damage, it was obvious that its engine was damaged. So there was no chance of its rising above the sea again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Admiral Baker stood up and shouted, “You idiots! Did you think all the undead were stupid like you? They are human-controlled undead, and somebody who is much smarter than you controls them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He loaded all four rifles behind his back and shouted, “Okay, from now on, I’m going to keep only useful guys on the ship.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The crew members corrected their postures.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, Sungwoo soared to a high altitude, riding Bone Wyvern Alpha Male. Shortly after he raided the Blue Wing from the air, he was intensively bombarded by the ships, but he managed to get out of the striking range at the last minute.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He took turns hiding behind the clouds and coming out, repeating such a strange action for a while.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Summon!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he said that, a skeleton was summoned over the wide spine of the Wyvern Alpha Male. It was Victor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Rattle… rattle…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Victor felt tired a lot. So much so that he squatted as soon as he was summoned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Master? Rattle…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Leaving that word behind, he was summoned back into the “Void Haven.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Summon!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And he was summoned again. It was already his 11th resummon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was just staring in the air without looking at Victor at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Rattle….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Done.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo smiled at the message that appeared before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Synergy effect’ is given due to team play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Synergy List]<br/><br/><br/><br/>5) Death Harmony (Hidden)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: job synergy<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Condition: 3 or more ‘Lich’-level death magic users<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: Upgraded to the exclusive skill, ‘Ultimate’ level (1 random type)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Players only<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The skill  is temporarily upgraded to .<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo aimed at a loophole in the condition of synergy activation to obtain  among random skill enhancements.<br/><br/><br/><br/> synergy was triggered when three Lich worked as one team.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, when Victor’s summoning and returning were repeated, synergy’ activation’ and ‘cancellation’ would be also repeated, which meant that the target skill to which the synergy was applied should be continuously ‘reset’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Rattle… Rattle!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And Sungwoo could get the skill he wanted after summoning Victor and canceling it eleven times.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way! Should I continue to do so in the future? It feels like motion sickness…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Victor said that, Sungwoo looked at him, which made him flinch.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do you get motion sickness?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s right!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Even if you have motion sickness, you have nothing to throw up, right? Are you lying to me? Biologically, you can’t get motion sickness.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you think like that, it is impossible for me to be biologically alive. Rattle..”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head, thinking Victor was smarter than he looked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Victor was nervous because he thought his tongue slipped before his master.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, let’s go out of the clouds.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was time to launch a full-fledged fight with the enemy fleet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whoooooooooooo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bone Wyvern Alpha Male pushed the wind hard and rose above the clouds in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked down on the terrifying battlefield from the high sky. The Baker Fleet looked like a tiny dot on the sea down there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Two battleships broke away from the flagship. There are only five left.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even before the full-scale battle began, the lineup of the Baker fleet was quite disorganized because Sungwoo took over one of them then bombarded another using it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nonetheless, they didn’t retreat. Watching the approaching Bone Wyvern, they were still prepared to fight back. It showed they were confident of defeating Sungwoo’s army.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, then destroy them as much as you can!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo controlled the undead army in the northern sky. Dozens of Bone Wyverns spread to the left and right widely. It was a battle formation intended to suffer as little damage as possible from the enemy’s firepower.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, the battleships of the Baker’s fleet also began to widen the space from each other little by little. It was a change of location to fire shells over the widest possible area. It was this kind of comprehensive attack that made people so scared of the attack by the fleet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘But they are moving slowly, compared with the Bone Wyvern.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo confirmed the weakness of the Baker fleet. Although the weight of the battleships was reduced due to the power of the ‘flying stone’, the weight of the cargo and crew in it could not be ignored.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘When starting from the hovering position, they can’t help but move slowly.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>If the battleships accelerated, they would be able to achieve a speed of more than 30 knots (55.5km/s), but when they stopped moving before operating again, it was inevitable for them to move very slowly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Let me break them one by one.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo gave orders again. All Bone Wyverns turned to the right. They aimed at the leftmost airship of the Baker Fleet as their main target.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, the Baker fleet wasn’t stupid either. The leftmost airship, which was Sungwoo’s target, slowly sailed back, while the airships on the right gradually advanced. It looked as if the compass needle was spinning slowly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Just by tilting their ranks with the flagship as the center, they could confine the battle group of Bone Wyverns within the striking range of their bombardment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And finally, when they got close enough, dozens of muzzles began to fire from the Baker battleships.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were sporadic explosions along with tremendous vibrations shaking the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though the battleships fired only once altogether, the battle line of the Baker fleet was forcibly sailed back as far as ten meters by the impact of the firing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Colorful shells containing the power of various spirits were fired in a straight line.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In just 3 seconds, the group of Bone Wyverns was destroyed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kugugugugugugugugu-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The bombardment not only affected the entire group of Bone Wyverns but also filled about one-third of the northern sky with smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Crazy…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although Sungwoo was prepared for their fierce counterattack, their firepower was much more forceful than he thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Explosions of all colors intertwined, forming a huge layer of fog. And he saw numerous pieces of bone being smashed and bouncing everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bone Wyverns were devastated. Sungwoo’s undead army as a whole evaporated in just one moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They’re so thrilled….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo watched the soldiers on the deck of the Baker fleet cheering for joy. It seemed that they were confident of the victory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo was making a mockery of their hasty joy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But it’s too early for you to rejoice…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next moment, something popped up from the left side of the colorful layers of fog.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Googoogoo-<br/><br/><br/><br/>It rotated fast, like a tornado moving horizontally, and fired toward the airship on the far left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The soldiers on the deck then stopped cheering and began to see the strange phenomenon taking place in the devastated enemy camp far away. They still didn’t know what it was.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was as if a huge monster in the fog layer stretched out its tentacles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking down at them, Sungwoo murmured, “Manufacture bone weapons!” </div><h2 id="chapter301">Chapter 301</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">

<br/><br/> <br/><br/>They were embarrassed to see the official broadcast changing to a different battlefield in an instant. All the viewers were confused.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the reason was simply that there was a much more interesting situation unfolding somewhere else. The camera was illuminating the center of the ruined city covered with black fog. Nobody would have survived in such a situation. But the Necromancer was standing in the middle of that hell. He was grabbing someone’s neck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kheeeeeeeeeek!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo shouted, “Why did you come back?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was Boris, the assassin sent to kill the Necromancer, who was No. 1 in the Russian server rankings, called the Tsar, who was struggling to get out of the Necromancer’s tight grip.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With both eyes bloodshot, he could not use any force. He somehow survived the hell the Necromancer created, but that was it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“So, the land here is much colder and harsher than Siberia?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The last survivor of the Busan battlefield was captured by the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since he once fought against the Necromancer, he was confident that he could kill the Necromancer easily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, Boris is the strongest guy who can beat anybody, and I’m sure he can beat the Necromancer. Sure, I trust him.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing concluded that Boris could beat the Necromance after carefully analyzing his power based on a lot of information. That’s why he dispatched Boris to the battlefield in Busan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But I can’t rely on Boris alone.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing was not the type of man who relied on his own conviction too much. So, he recognized Boris’s power but did not trust him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Of course, he can fail…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>That’s why he took extensive “additional measures” in case of Boris’s failure. In addition to the priests requested by Boris, he decided to select and send a number of “elite soldiers” to Busan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right before he deployed them, General Xing gave them a sharp reminder.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Just remember that nothing is as foolish as your conviction. Your conviction leaves you off guard and makes you miss the chance to prepare thoroughly. So, you should try to stand on your own rather than relying on Boris.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, we’ll kill him without fail.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“General, don’t worry. You trust us, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The “elite troops” selected by the general were full of confidence, as always. In fact, they comprised one thousand ace fighters, including the sniper squad who assassinated thousands so far, the Kwanggum Unit, often called China’s holy knights, and the sorcerer corps led by the four-star “Arc Mage”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Because of that, they would certainly get on their high horses even when they were sent out to confront the Dragon, not the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alright. No matter what they say, you are the best elites of the empire. But you have to make yourself perfect warriors for your honor and reputation all the time. And you can become perfect when you think you are not perfect.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as General Xing spoke with a heavy voice, they, who were overflowing with confidence, became sober and sincere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’re going to keep in mind what you have said, and join you in Suwon, your battlefield right after doing a great service in Busan.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, I will trust you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With such a large number of overwhelming elites deployed in Busan, General Xing thought it was a fait accompli that Busan would be the Necromancer’s grave.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, their operation completely failed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Twelve hours after they were deployed in Busan, the battle began.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While General Xing was commanding his troops in Suwon, he was briefed on a shocking report.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“General!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What’s up?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Busan was bombed!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“And it’s estimated that our forces were annihilated!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first, the general could not figure out what his deputy was talking about. He even doubted the war report. But by checking the official channel broadcast, he could confirm the devastated Busan, which gave him the creeps.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Man, this was a much more difficult battle than I thought.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Despite the tremendous tragic news, General Xing was not embarrassed. He rather began to be happy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘A difficult war is supposed to bring more pleasure.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Feeling his heart beating fast, he quickened the pace of occupying Suwon because he was not sure when the unpredictable monster Necromance would appear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘This is a race against time. I have to end this fight before he appears here.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, the general lifted his head and looked at the World Tree rising in the center of the village inside the city.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Let me quickly break through the wall and pull out the world tree. So, even if the Necromancer wins this battle, I have to make sure he does not challenge us again.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He smiled softly. Even if he lost one battle, he had no problem as long as he won the war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Boris struggled with his neck grabbed by the Necromancer. He could not admit it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wasn’t he the ruler of the harsh Siberia and No. 1 in the Russian server rankings?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although he was humiliated in a surprise attack last time, he was different this time. He came out, burning with desire to take revenge on the Necromancer. He didn’t even drink to guard himself against any stupid lapse or mistake.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But he collapsed without even attacking the Necromancer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn bastard…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Boris survived thanks to his strong build but that was it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He couldn’t even walk on his own because he was trapped by all kinds of curses, such as explosions, poison, and Abyssal Breath.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How could you attack me in such a mean way…?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He couldn’t give up his pride until the last minute.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo punched his abdomen heavily, its impact made him droop helplessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kheeeeek…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, Sungwoo tightened his grip on his neck hard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This time I don’t smell any alcohol from you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, I didn’t drink because I came here sober after deciding I would not be defeated again. I was determined I would not let you deceive me…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo sneered at him and quipped, “Man, that’s why you’re stupid. You just believed you found out how to attack me and became arrogant as if you found a new world. That’s why you are repeating the same mistake.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo smashed Boris down to the concrete. A tremendous impact climbed up his spine and made his backbone tingle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Next, a troll skeleton appeared right next to Sungwoo. The skeleton was holding a lava-flowing sword, ‘Levatain,’ in his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was handed over the sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wait a minute…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Boris held out his palm, but Sungwoo stabbed the sword in his chest without hesitation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how strong his body was, he could not withstand Sungwoo’s lethal stroke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m sorry, but I don’t have time to hear your bullshit.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Lebatain turned red with flames, Boris’s upper body crumbled and turned into ashes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment the last survivor collapsed, a message appeared before Sungwoo’s eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The Korean server has won the ‘Busan’ battlefield!<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You can ‘join’ another battlefield in 5 minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s eyebrows wriggled when he saw the message. It was an unexpected situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, this is dangerous…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He could not move to Suwon in five minutes, no matter what. These five minutes would make heaven and earth difference in this all-out war. If he couldn’t arrive at the next battle in five minutes, his allies could be killed. </div><h2 id="chapter320">Chapter 320</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Huge roots and vines filled everything inside a 35-story building made of concrete and reinforced steel. They sprung up from the basement, blocking the windows, and tightly wrapping the walls and columns. Thump! Thump! The bombardment against the building continued. The enemies intended to use flying weapons to destroy the building. The building shook as if it would collapse at any moment, but it would hold out for 11 minutes because the roots were firmly supporting the entire building. “Their bombing has stopped…” When Jisu said that, the King of the Great Mountain gently opened his eyes. Sitting cross-legged in the middle of the building, he was energizing the roots at the moment. “They realized that attacking so recklessly like that would take more time. They know how precious time is now…” Although Jisu and her party preferred to hold out even one more minute, the enemies wanted to finish the battle one minute faster. Apart from victory or defeat, the battle in Seoul was a ‘race against time.’ “But the fact that they became so quiet…” Jisu gently closed her eyes. She expanded her senses and examined the situation outside the building. “Well, it means that they have hidden intentions.” The enemies were still hovering around the building. Unlike when they were determined to blast the building with flying weapons, they were now moving very secretly. ‘They are moving while muting their footsteps as much as possible. They are ninjas!’ The King of the Great Mountain also noticed their movement. “Exactly. They have decided to penetrate our area. So, please understand my arrogant posture like this because I have to pay attention to supporting the building all the time.” The king was using all his power to control the roots. Nodding at him, she drew his sword and said, “Don’t worry.” And she stood in the middle of the dark corridor. Beyond the darkness was the main gate of the building. She stared at the gate. She could not check it out with her naked eyes because there was no light, but her sharp senses vividly reproduced the entire space. ‘They have come in.’ Jisu turned her wrist holding her sword to loosen its muscles. “Jisu, they just took off the roots and came inside the building. Let me continue to regenerate the broken holes, but I can’t keep stopping them like this, so you have to fight them.” Then, the king’s eyes turned to the two tigers behind his back. “Just assume you’re dead when you go out and fight.” “Yes! Of course!” “I will sacrifice my life!” Instead of the king who could not move, the two tigers stepped forward. They stood side by side on both sides of Jisu, with a huge sledgehammer on their shoulders. Then, he stared into the darkness of the hallway. At that moment, a breath of wind blew in and wandered the hallway. It meant that the entrance of the main gate was opened slightly. The two tigers pricked their ears attentively. Jisu opened her eyes wide. She slowly raised her left hand and put on the Ghost Face Mask then held her breath briefly. Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu- This time it was not the sound of the wind. This was the sound of their footsteps disguised as that of the wind. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr- When the two tigers exposed their teeth, their heavy roaring resonated throughout the hallway. Obviously, they sent a warning to those who came inside the building. It was also a warning to the friendly forces that if they dared to approach, it would be inevitable for them to collide. ‘They are coming.’ What came next was obviously their collision. Something flew in the dark in the hallway. It was a heavy leather pouch. “It’s a bomb!” The tigers shouted. It was a bomb bag. They struck the hammer to the floor. Then, a green shield bounced off the floor and encircled them. However, Jisu made a different choice. ‘If we let them take the initiative, we are going to be driven into a corner. We can’t hold out long here in that case.’ In an instant, a blue flame rose above her shoulder. At the same time, she jumped off the ground. She got out of the shield and ran toward the darkness in the hallway. Bang! Bang! Bang! An explosion was heard behind her, scattering pieces of iron in all directions. She was still within the striking range of the enemies. Dozens of pieces of iron were being thrown to rip her apart. She could feel that her neck, back, and pelvis would be smashed into pieces when hit directly. So, she had to lie flat on the floor. But she couldn’t stop here. Hwaaaaaaaah! She swung the sword to emit the flashes of the blue blade. Dozens of flashes were shot toward the narrow corridors, ripping the roots tangled in walls and ceilings. When they made roaring noises from the walls, those faces hidden in the darkness were clearly revealed, stricken with fear. She wielded the blue blade of the sword against them. “Ahhhhhhhhhh!” “Argh!” The flashes of the blue blade killed the ninjas in black clothes hiding between the roots mercilessly and disappeared at the end of the corridor. It was a perfect stroke. “Ugh!” But Jisu was also hit, with blood coming from her shoulder and waist stuck by pieces of metal. No matter how fast she ran, she couldn’t avoid the flying fragments of the bomb. But she adjusted her position without caring at all. When she was done slaughtering a group of ninjas, their blood gushed into the air, then came down into her sword. -‘Wolfberg’ absorbs the enemy’s blood. (Total 5)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Temporarily increases muscle strength and agility (+5) Her Viking Sword “Wolfberg” began to take a peculiar effect with blood. In addition, Jisu also prepared for a full-scale hunt. -You have activated ‘Hunting Instinct’.<br/><br/>When the battle lasts for 120 seconds, ‘Hunting Start’ opens. Her eyes were torn vertically, scanning the darkness. “Whew…” There were corpses scattered in the corridor where the blue blade of her sword swept through. But not all of them were killed. “Kill that bitch!” “Tear her right away!” Those who escaped her attack crawled out of their fellows’ corpses. They were a total of 11. They threw shurikens at Jisu at the same time. Two of them even lifted ‘hand cannons,’ which were very lethal in a narrow place like this. Bang! Bang! Jisoo struck back their shurikens then turned her body round to get out of their attack range. However, the corridor was too narrow for her to avoid all the iron beads scattering widely. “Argh!” Several iron beads brushed past her neck and shoulders. One of them crushed her left collarbone. She felt pain and hotness all over her body. “What are you doing? Stop her!” But when she swung her sword, two guys’ necks were cut at once. -‘Wolfberg’ absorbs the enemy’s blood. (Total 7 people)<br/><br/>Temporarily increases muscle strength and agility (+7) Right after that, she pushed the falling enemies to the side then penetrated the enemy line and nullified their rifles. Spitting out curses, they fired hand cannons and drew swords. But it was too late. When she swung her sword twice; their four arms were cut off at the same time. They instinctively stepped back but got entangled back and forth in the narrow corridor, creating a huge mess. “Kheeeek!” And she beheaded two more in the blink of an eye. Puck! Puck! She brutally killed them one after another, as if she were a wild cat attacking a chicken coop at dawn. “Damn it! Ignore that bitch and infiltrate into the building! Kill the guy making the roots!”<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter321">Chapter 321</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            They were now on the defensive. So, they focused on tackling the source of the problem rather than confronting her. In other words, they thought that if they could get rid of the roots surrounding the building by obstructing the King of the Great Mountain, their troops estimated several thousands could mount an all-out attack. “Who the hell are you aiming at now?” “You can’t pass here!” The two tigers firmly blocked the exit of the corridor. The ninjas charged at them recklessly, but they right away turned into chunks of meat when hit by their sledgehammers. “Man, they’re easier to handle than boiling potatoes!” “Jisu, don’t worry about this place!” Instead of caring about the ninjas who were running away behind her back, she kept moving forward, killing a total of ten ninjas. At that moment, a message appeared before her eyes. -‘Wolfberg’ has absorbed enough blood from the enemy. You get the ‘Song of Battlefield’ effect for 5 minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You become immune to all ‘abnormal status,’ so you don’t feel ‘pain’. ‘Alright. I can fight more boldly now,’ Jisu murmured. She looked down at her sword and checked out the effect again. [Item information] -Name: Wolfberg -Grade: Legend -Category: One-handed sword -Effect: Whenever you cut the enemy, your strength and agility are temporarily increased by (+1). (Maximum 10) When you reach the maximum, you get the ‘Song of Battlefield’ effect for five minutes. (You become immune to abnormal conditions, so you don’t feel any pain.) But that wasn’t all. -You have been invited to an ‘Unknown Place’.<br/><br/>In order to accept the invitation, you must meet the ‘special conditions’ first, then open the ‘Door of the Recognized.’ ‘Unknown Place? What the heck is this?’ This was a strange message to her, but it seemed that she received a ‘hidden quest’ when the effect of “Song of Battlefield” was issued. ‘This is not important now.” She had no time to pay attention to the message. “Break it!” shouted the enemies. Suddenly, more enemies came inside the building. This time there was a whopping 22. Jisu charged at them once again. “Uh?” The enemies momentarily stopped at Jisoo’s bold attack. And their hesitation led to their death. “Kheeeeeeeel!” The moment the tip of Jisoo’s sword touched the enemy’s neck, the lights of blade energy came out, cutting his neck before hitting the eyes of another enemy right behind him. Jisu killed the two enemies who were collapsing then got right into the middle of the 20 enemies. “What the heck is this?’ “Oh my…” The enemies were embarrassed by Jisu’s fanatic attack, as it was beyond their understanding. Their embarrassment clouded their judgment and slowed down their action. Jisu was again much faster. She swung her sword in all directions as if dancing with it In an instant, 14 out of 22 enemies fell after they were beheaded. The remaining eight aimed for the king’s life, but they were stopped by the two tigers. In no time, the long corridor was filled with the enemy corpses so much that there was no place to put their feet. There was a pool of blood under the corpses. While adjusting her posture, she felt like she was now standing in a muddy field near a ditch. Without the disgusting smell of blood, she might have believed that. “Dispatch Team 4!” “Just advance without stopping! There are only four enemies!” The enemies kept intruding inside the building. With thousands of enemy troops on standby around this building, it was natural that they would stay on the offensive. Gasp! Gasp! Jisu was out of breath now. She didn’t feel any pain thanks to the effect of the Song of the Battlefield, but the blood kept coming out from the open wounds all over her body. She even felt the fragments stuck into her skin were getting into it more deeply. But what she could do right now was to ignore such strange feelings and cut the enemies. “That bitch has appeared again!” There were more enemies this time, 26 all told. She chose to charge at them again. She didn’t want to give them any time to respond calmly. “She is coming! Get ready!” the enemies shouted. However, the moment she took one step forward, she realized that she made the wrong choice. ‘There must be something different here.’ The moment the enemies dispersed to the left and the right, an unknown object lifted its head. “Ah…” It was a huge cannon. It was already ignited, making the powder chamber and barrel glow red, just like the snout of an excited sea crocodile. ‘Let me Shadow Step as soon as possible…’ she murmured. No enemies were moving at that moment. While she paused very briefly, the muzzle opened fire. Bang! No matter how fast she was, she couldn’t escape the attack of the massive flying weapon that fired hundreds of shots in this narrow corridor. Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh! Hundreds of pieces of iron flew in, slashing the air into pieces. No matter where she moved, she couldn’t escape. She crouched, but her little body was swept away by the pieces of iron. She soared into the air like a kicked doll, thrown into the wall at the end of the corridor. “Argh…” Her vision turned blurry. -You got closer to the ‘Door of the Recognized.’<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Standing in the ruined Busan, Sungwoo was staring at the message before his eyes. -You can join another battlefield soon. (00:00:04) “Finally, I can move….” It was a timer. Five minutes was very long for him, but finally, the countdown was over. -Choose the battlefield you want to join. </div><h2 id="chapter322">Chapter 322</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>While all those who stepped out to block the hole were warrior-type players, only Hanho was an assassin-type player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Do not worry. You may worry if I have only one dagger, but I’ve got six! You will see me using an unprecedented skill.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, four arms protruded from behind his back, lifting a total of six daggers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Of course, there are few players who can withstand their attack as well as you, but I can’t believe a thief-type like you is standing at the forefront like this…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a blue light flashed from Hanho’s iron helmet. Then, a protective shield was created around Hanho and Minsok. It was the effect of the “Spirit of the Personal Guard”, an iron helmet Hanho received from the King of the Great Mountain, which gave a shield to him and one of his allies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Minsok, I am not an ordinary thief,” said Hanho with a smile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, you must be a miscellaneous, oh no, talented thief…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They stopped talking right away because the advance party of the Chinese troops approached them very closely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are coming!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The overwhelming number of Chinese troops stormed like a swarm of grasshoppers, which dwarfed the Korean server troops.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everybody, get ready for collision with the enemies!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Put your shields forward!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everyone lifted their shields. In the name of the Korean server, they were now ready to engage in an all-out fight with the Chinese troops.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sheeeek! Sheeeeek! Sheeeek!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right before the two sides started fighting, Hanho threw three daggers at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The advance party of the Chinese troops also lifted their shields, but Hanho’s daggers fell through the shields, stabbing into their chests accurately by flying in a parabola as if they calculated the enemies’ movement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two at the forefront fell. Then, a holy shield was overlaid on Hanho’s body. It was the moment that his skill, ‘Killer of Conviction,’ was triggered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When Minsok reached out with his left hand, green energy shrouded Hanho’s six arms.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Paralysis Poison’ has been applied to your weapon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* When you attack the enemy, it causes a “paralysis” effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho looked at Minsok with a surprised expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! What is this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you received something, don’t you think you should give me something in return? As a matter of fact, I’m not an ordinary knight.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Great! Bring it on!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, the knight who used magic and the thief who used all kinds of skills joined hands to block the enemies at the forefront.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let’s fight!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hold out!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as the warriors shouted and collided with the enemies, five or six weapons were thrown at Hanho’s head. Noticing he had no helmet, they wanted to kill him first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it was their mistake. Hanho was covered with a heavy shield just like the Crusader Team. Besides, it was refilled with a new one when broken, so he was more sturdy than any tank.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Without any hesitation, Hanho got entangled with the enemies and stabbed them with the six daggers randomly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get away from me, bastard!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh, who the heck are you, son of a bitch!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>No matter how wide their shields were, they could not block the six blades he was stabbing randomly from their left, right, above, and below.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kheeeeeeek!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their screams burst out endlessly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In addition, the paralysis skill that Minsok used on his behalf also played a part in stopping the enemies from charging at him. As a result, those enemies who collided with Hanho collapsed without any exception.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Bring it on! Hey, you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho defeated more enemies than Minsok, the “Death Knight” who stood next to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seen from a distance, it looked like a mixer with six blades seemed to rotate when Hanho attacked them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even Minsok, fearing the enemy’s offensive, was standing firmly while holding up his shield tightly, but Hanho could unilaterally attack them without any hesitation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, you are much stronger than I thought, Hanho…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok was truly surprised. He fought with Hanho on the same battlefield several times, but it was the first time he witnessed Hanho fighting right before his eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hahaha! Oh, I’m disappointed that you have realized my abilities only now! Yeah, there are a lot who don’t know I’m the hidden strong guy among the Necromancer’s team members.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyway, they could defend the No. 3 hole thanks to Hanho’s brilliant performance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Great! We can hold out!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everyone, hold out with the strongest thief as the leader!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Highly motivated by Hanho, those fighting with him shouted Hanho’s name here and here. And their morale was at an all-time high.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, Hanho was always forgotten among his allies, but it was true that he was one of the top fighters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the Chinese troops didn’t ignore the defeat of their advance party. They immediately began to carry out another operation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, look at that over there!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The security guys at the watchtower at the highest place of the castle wall in the village found something suspicious.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’ve noticed some suspicious movement in the enemy’s flagship!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Admiral Baker appeared directly on the deck of his ship. He was aiming at the third hole with a rifle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is he going to snipe?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“From such a distance?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The guards couldn’t figure out what he was trying to do, but they noticed a line of red lasers coming out of the muzzle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way! Is that a guided bomb?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was similar to the technique of inducing an air bombardment by the ground troops. As expected, something strange rose from the stern of the flagship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It climbed vertically, followed by gray smoke, then quickly flew toward the wall in a parabolic curve. Obviously, it was something like a guided bomb.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was one of the exclusive skills that Admiral Baker could use, which he could not use in succession, but it was a special item that boasted of a tremendous striking range.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Frightened by that scene, the guards shouted at the third hole.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Run away! It’s a long-range bombing!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But they had little time to avoid the bombing. With the troops from both sides engaged in fighting with bare hands, the guided bombs fell over them. Baker even killed his own troops to break through the blocked third hole.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Red heat filled the third hole fully. About a hundred people, both from the Korean server and the Chinese server, were killed at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fortunately, Hanho survived the bombing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ooops! I feel like throwing up…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Swept by the tremendous explosion, he bounced off into the castle and hit against the street light, but he could come to his senses because of the hard banging.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-All your shields have been ruined by the big impact.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The shield covering his body flickered, then went out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho’s mother, Eunhee, jumped out from among the non-combat players who were supporting the battle in the rear. But she called her son’s name desperately when she was stopped by people around her. Actually, she secretly discouraged him not to when he told her he would go to the frontline for fighting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho! Oh, no! Come over here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho shook his head violently. He felt so dizzy but came to his senses a bit when he heard his mother’s voice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You were wounded a lot. You need treatment quickly!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Hanho barely stood, feeling the pain all over his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shaking his head, he murmured because he was too weak to shout to his mother.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, I’m sorry, mom.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He again turned to the third hole.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Gosh, I don’t really want to play this cool role again, but if I come to your side, mom, the guys here are in big trouble.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he adjusted his helmet and summoned Asura’s arm again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can’t run away from here. Sungwoo has assigned me here…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the moment he took his first step, he became frustrated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He stumbled. At the same time, he felt tremendous pain all over his body including the back of his head. He felt like all his nervous system was screaming, so he almost fell over and screamed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it…It hurts so much.” </div><h2 id="chapter323">Chapter 323</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>As a matter of fact, his ankle was broken. He just stood frozen on the spot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God! I shouldn’t stay here like this, but I can’t move. What should I do?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho was embarrassed. He wanted to fight by all means, but he could not walk at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even the high-ranking Priests weren’t around. Hanho himself was a priest, but he was not strong enough to set his broken ankle right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no…I should get up.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He raised his head and looked at the third hole. Taking just one step was so painful. How could he move his aching body over there and fight?<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, somebody called him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Brother! Toughest thief brother!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ugh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was that little boy Youngin, Hanho’s only fan. Classified as a non-combat player, he saw Hanho while carrying brick materials to the second hole.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Brother? Are you okay? You are not okay, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His eyes were trembling. Despite his young age and low level, he was full of excitement and curiosity, but he was terrified right now because he had never been exposed to this kind of war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are we losing now? Are we losing this time? Like when we were beaten by the pirates…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Did he recall the trauma of the pirates’ slaughter of his father? It was true that they were now on the defensive because of the enemy’s strong attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tears welled in Hanho’s eyes because of tremendous pain, but he smiled at Youngjin to show he was okay, but at that moment, he had a nosebleed showing that he was hurt.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, don’t be scared and fight confidently! You said you want to become stronger like me, right?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Hanho remembered what Youngin had told him on Ganghwa Island.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Although he felt ashamed to hear that, Hanho felt most proud about it in his life. In fact, he fought more fiercely after that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey, next time you may have to stand in front of that hole. So, stay awake!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Are you sure? Me next time?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why? Can’t you do it?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At this moment, Youngin couldn’t answer confidently, but Hanho nodded because he could understand that young boy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, this battle really sucks! But you can’t run away from it just because you can’t fight.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then Hanho turned his head again and walked toward the third hole with a limp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He said, “Man, since I’ve met the wrong guy, I’m playing the role of a hero where no credit is due…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He took out a bottle of health recovery potion from his waist, drank it, and moved to the hole of the castle wall. He kept complaining while walking, “Shit! It would have been better for me to throw daggers from behind somebody!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The hole got even bigger because of the bombing. Since the bombing affected not only Hanho’s allies but also the enemy, there was a brief lull in the fighting at the third hole.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the second batch of the enemy’s troops was already advancing toward them. But the allies could not even regroup and prepare for their attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What are you doing? Back to your position!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We should block the hole!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those who witnessed their fellow soldiers being killed by the bombing could not dare to go back to defend the hole. Only one, namely, Minsok, was standing before the broken hole.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bounced away by the bombing, there were cracks in his skull and armor, and his shield was cut in half.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hanho, you are definitely different from an ordinary thief,” he said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho stood next to Minsuk with a smile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I told you about it repeatedly in the past. You are the second who has finally recognized me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What? Only two? I can’t believe it. Have you hidden your abilities on purpose?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He said, shrugging, “Well, I like to move around quietly like you, Dark Knight. By the way, the enemies must feel very upset because they failed to kill us, right? I guess it’s time for somebody to appear to rescue us…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, he looked up at the sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, it looks like he is coming late today. But if he really comes late, we might be in big trouble…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing became impatient. The resistance of the Korean server was more persistent than he expected. In fact, it was natural for him to expect the fight would drag on like this. He also felt their resistance was understandable. However, he became impatient because the Necromancer won the battle in Busan too soon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘We have to make a breakthrough. Admiral Baker used even the hidden skill exclusive to him but failed. The two guys are the problem.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only two people were changing the tide of the war strangely by blocking the key points.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Let me directly take action!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing eventually stood up. He expected his troops could break through the holes of the castle wall quickly, but they couldn’t. So, he could not afford to command without fighting himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Deputy, open the Spirit Control Box!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When he shouted, his deputy standing behind him raised his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“General! Are you going to fight in person? Currently, we have only four high-grade boxes controlling the spirit.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, I was thinking of saving them until the last moment, but we have no time. Open two of them right away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two trucks appeared at his order. There were white wooden boxes in the cargo compartment on the truck, which had not only all sorts of amulets attached to them, but also a chain icon meaning ‘seal magic’ around the boxes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey! Handle it carefully! If the high-grade box is opened, we are going to be annihilated!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The words ‘water’ and ‘high-grade’ were engraved on the boxes in calligraphy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing approached the frontline, followed by the two trucks carrying the boxes. Senior sorcerers were deployed around him to spread protective shields. Since their defense was so tight, anyone could guess that the commander-in-chief of the Chinese army appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Open the boxes!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wizards who were on standby at the general’s command used the ‘unseal magic’ on the boxes. And each time the magic box was unsealed one by one, the boxes shook violently as if to explode anytime.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gugugugugugugu—<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something inside the boxes was expressing pain and anger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, the boxes broke and something flowed out of them. It was just transparent water.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was nothing more than that. The wizards who unsealed the boxes were also embarrassed by something unexpected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Is that all?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the next moment the water that came out from the boxes with a scream began to soar in the air. It was split into dozens of strands, then changed into the shape of a human face. It was full of pain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That is…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are the high-grade water spirit!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Only then did the wizards notice what was coming out from the boxes. It wasn’t water. It was a spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The high-grade water spirit that we captured after defeating the wizard Leeway of the Chinese 2nd server? Man, who would have expected he would appear here?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a matter of fact, Leeway was the colleague of the spirits who dominated the “China-2 Server” until recently. It was widely known to the public that the spirit was intelligent and kind to humans. There were even rumors that he splashed around with kids. But the spirit as known to the public was gone. Instead, there was a vicious beast tied to a purple chain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kheeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me give you an order now. Destroy the enemy according to my orders!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When General Xing beckoned, the purple chain darkened. Then, like a dog being dragged by a leash, the chain was moving freely as the general directed it with his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Water Spirit, don’t resist! If you resist, it will bring about your end! Your fate is in my hands!”<br/><br/> </div><h2 id="chapter324">Chapter 324</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>General Xing was also a spirit controller by profession. But he preferred to use his “control” to have spirits serve as his slaves rather than borrowing the power of spirits by cultivating “affinity” with them. The general used the method of hunting and detaining spirits for this purpose, but he needed a special solvent and courage for this, so he created dozens of “dedicated teams” made up of spirits and alchemists.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I feel good. They are the guys who used to be under Leeway’s control.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The “high-grade water spirit” was a strong weapon as well as a difficult material that could not be obtained again. So, the general saved it to deal with the Necromancer, but he boldly used some of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kheeeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The water spirits began to swell like a bubble while it was being dragged by the chain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Run away, everybody!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get away from the wall!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Chinese army hurriedly retreated, remembering the indiscriminate bombing carried out by Admiral Baker. Soon, the high-grade water spirits turned into huge waves, soaring like dragons before thundering toward the wall. Then, they swept away everything like a roaring river.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cracks broke out in the wall, and those standing in front of the hole were swept away by the “spirit waves”.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wasn’t just a stream of water. Long arms protruded between the streams, grabbing, scraping, and pulling those that stood in the way before drawing them. All this happened in an instant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, those blocking the third hole were swept away once again. It was more effective than Admiral Baker’s bombing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing said to his deputy, with his hands behind his back, “Now, I’ve opened the gate to the wall. Just go and take over the castle!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, his expression was distorted as if he felt ominous.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my…General, look over there!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were some who were standing tall in the place devastated by the overwhelming waves. “I can’t believe it! They withstood it and survived?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As expected, it was Minsok and Hanho who survived the devastating attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minsok held out by hooking a chain on the wall, while Hanho endured, holding on to the six daggers he struck into the ground. In other words, they withstood the natural disaster with their bodies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Cough! Cough! Man, this is nothing, compared with the Ocean World’s wave pool! Cough!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With his hands trembling violently, Hanho was shouting in anger like a stray cat revealing her teeth to protect her territory after she was hit by a splash of water.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the presence of the two was enough to slow down the enemies who were about to charge at the castle. It was natural that they were scared of the two players’ strong resilience before such a devastating attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who the hell is that guy?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Why didn’t he fall?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And finally, the man that Hanho had been waiting for arrived.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘winner (Korea Server)’ of the Busan battlefield has joined the battlefield in Suwon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* ‘Battlefield victory buffs’ are issued to the Korean server. (Temporarily increase all stats +10)<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>The time has come.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The same message appeared before everyone’s eyes on the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hanho grinned, spitting out water mixed with blood from his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, we’ve survived!” he shouted with joy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the other hand, there was a deep confusion on the Chinese side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Chinese troops got louder and busier to prepare for the Necromancer’s attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, where is that guy?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The general looked around, but he couldn’t see his undead army anywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Singh shouted, “No matter where he appeared with his forces, our forces are overwhelming! Watch out for the explosion! Stop him from advancing and break through the castle gate!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing thought that although the Necromancer blew away Busan entirely with an unknown skill, such a trick would not work in Suwon.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>‘No way! He would never turn the tide of the battle with such a cheap trick.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing thought he could win the battle in Suwon easily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘And it’s not difficult to stop his undead army. Let me have the water spirits and the rear army delay his advance, then break through the castle gate and pull out the world tree!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer’s troops were certainly strong, but they were not enough to overwhelm the huge Chinese army. As a result, the battle would inevitably drag on, and given the limits to the Necromancer’s power, the Chinese army would inevitably win, the general thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Soon, my troops will join us from Seoul, so we will prevail anyway.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like he said, if the Chinese forces joined them in Suwon, the battle would be over in favor of General Xing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a blue light spread over his head with a roaring sound. Everyone raised their heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Over the sky of the battlefield, something began to come out from the grey clouds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Watch out!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He is coming down from the sky! Prepare for anti-aircraft fire!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Chinese army quickly moved in unison. Since they already predicted his attack from the air, they were well prepared for that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, a portal opened in the sky. Everyone looked at it in silence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, someone shouted, “Uh? What the hell is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What popped out of it was something that no one predicted. The Chinese soldiers were swallowed up by the enormous shadow of that ridiculous object.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Is it a building?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>What protruded from the portal was the skyscraper of an overturned building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kugugugugugu–<br/><br/><br/><br/>A huge arm made of bones appeared, holding the whole building broken in half.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The building used to stand in Haeundae, Busan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nonsense! How come a building popped out from the sky?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Perhaps because the building was swept by a big explosion, flames were soaring all over the building. With hundreds of undead spirits attached to the wall, they were hugging many more corpses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kugugugugugu―<br/><br/><br/><br/>That enormous object fell toward the middle of the enemy camp, exhaling long streams of gray smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was something like an asteroid colliding with another one.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Hanho giggled at the scenes because he now knew why Sungwoo could not join him late.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I didn’t expect he would arrive with a meteor. This is a bit too strong…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Necromancer didn’t want a long fight. That’s why he appeared with a fatal weapon to destroy the enemy with one attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu was gasping for breath, leaning against the wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment the tanks fired cannons, she fell on the floor and hid between the corpses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She could save her life, but she could not avoid being severely wounded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Haaaa…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Her palms on the floor were soaked in blood. Lots of blood flowed from the wounds all over her body. An ordinary man would have already died from shock.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The Necromancer has arrived in Suwon. Please rest assured.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain approached her. He had stopped maintaining the enormous number of roots because his roots attack paid off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, we have made it!” She smiled at him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Their operation was a success. By tying up to 6,000 Chinese troops in Seoul, they helped protect the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, their fight was not over yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was an explosion in the hallway. Soon, two tigers covered in blood were thrown into the room. They were hit by the large cannons.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kheeeeeek!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After Jisoo collapsed, the two tigers were trying to stop them by all means, but they could not resist any longer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh! Brother, my younger tiger was…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>One tiger raised another one’s head, but that’s it. He didn’t move at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He is dead.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a matter of fact, the tiger was covered with more wounds than Jisu. His fur was already soaked with blood, with iron fragments all over his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“And I don’t think I’m going to survive. Sorry…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even the surviving tiger’s eyes began to be blurry. He struggled to survive, but couldn’t.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Thanks for your good job!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the king approved, the tiger lowered his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Poor guys! They lived on potatoes all their lives…But you guys will have a different fate.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king lifted the blue dragon ax that he stuck on the floor. </div><h2 id="chapter325">Chapter 325</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The king reached out to the corridor where there was a big fuss. When he did so, the remaining roots moved like curtains and blocked the hallway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jisu, the roots are going to disappear soon, then the enemy will try to destroy the whole building again. What are you going to do? It doesn’t matter whether you go out or stay inside because you will be killed anyway.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way, I can’t let myself be killed without doing anything.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She raised herself with difficulty. Although she stumbled, she had no intention of being killed as an onlooker.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I thought you would fight to the end,” he said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The roots that were blocking the wall and windows disappeared, and light came in instead. Then, the enemy made more disturbances than before. It was the sound of their flying weapons rolling on the floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thud! Thud!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if they noticed that the roots were disappearing, they began bombing again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Goong-gugugugu!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The building began to collapse, hit by only two cannons fired by the enemy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They began to bomb us already? Ah! Because the roots that were supporting the building disappeared, the building can not stand! We have to get out of here now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king moved the remaining roots and wrapped them around her body because they would be killed under the collapsing building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment they got out of the building, an explosion suddenly broke out, throwing each of them in different directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’ve hit them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wizards who were waiting outside the building shot fire magic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu rolled on the ground miserably. Normally, she would have minimized the impact of her fall and recovered her balance, but she could not do it right now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Her body stopped rolling after her waist bumped against a fire hydrant. She raised her upper body using the sword like a staff, but she could not give strength to her legs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She slowly lifted her head. Her vision was blurry because her face was stained with blood. She found herself surrounded by hundreds of enemies in no time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Surrounding her from all directions, they approached her slowly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though they must have heard a lot about her reputation as a formidable fighter, she now looked like a dying fox, so they courageously approached her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, this bitch can’t even move right now. Kill her right now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Jisu shut her teeth tightly, sneering at them. Then, she raised her body with all her might. There was already a pool of blood under her feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She raised the Ghost Mast that stretched to her neck and put it on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, this is a good opportunity for you guys to kill me. Kill me if you can!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, they threw knives, spears, axes, daggers and arrows at her with a shout.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang! Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>She struck down two arrows, but she couldn’t stop one of the daggers from getting stuck in her back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Let me kill as many of them as possible.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>She didn’t stop their attack. She didn’t care about getting wounded because she needed to move efficiently to kill more of them. So, she moved solely to destroy the approaching enemy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang! Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>She deflected three blades at the same time, but she staggered. She was so wounded that she could not withstand such a little attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But that was the same with her opponents, who lost balance from her attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She stabbed the sword into the staggering enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kheeeeeeek!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>She stabbed their hearts with the sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have obtained 12,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As soon as she took the sword out of the enemy’s heart, she swung it at the men behind her hack. Two of them fell, grabbing their necks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have obtained 14,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have obtained 14,000 gold by killing a player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a couple of daggers were stuck into her shoulder and thigh. Her left arm drooped with its tendon broken. Then, the enemies began to close in on her again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kill her!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, she was still holding her sword. As long as she was holding it, she could kill one more enemy. She swung the sword at the enemy charging at her from the left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>But there was no sword in her hand, or more precisely her right hand was missing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When she turned her eyes, her severed right arm was soaring into the air, then fell on the pool of blood on the ground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Great. But you are finished now,” said the masked man who cut her arm.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She nodded at him. He was right. Her end was nearing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But she lowered her head. The masked man approached her. He grabbed the sword with both hands. She felt the blade falling over her head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right before his sword touched her neck, she twisted her body and stuck to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, she pulled out the dagger from her left shoulder and cut his neck by turning her body quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kheeeeek!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although her left cheek was torn apart, she succeeded in killing him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kill me if you can…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although she was completely defeated, she was not yet ready to be killed obediently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You tough bitch! You are really…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, they began to admire her resistance. Since they were used to training while serving their swordmaster, they had no choice but to feel in awe of her toughness in such a perilous situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But that was it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Three arrows were stuck in her chest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She felt that something indescribable was flowing out of her body in addition to the gushing of all the blood from it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Is it my soul?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>She felt the world became dark.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then it became bright again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have entered an ‘unknown place’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘What the heck? It’s so noisy here.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>And it became very noisy. Loud laughter and shouting came from everywhere, which included the sound of somebody singing and others fighting. She felt like she was thrown into the middle of a party.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What the heck is this place?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jisu looked around, but she could see nothing. All she could guess from her blurry eyes was that a lot of people gathered in a huge hut were eating and chatting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Be quiet!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, they became silent when someone shouted. He was the man who sat at the highest palace of the hut. According to her senses, they didn’t really exist. They were something like an event scene to convey a message.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Your new fate has arrived here. After a very intense fight, you have faced a miserable death. You have killed so many before you were killed. So…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Obviously. that message referred to Jisu.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, she wondered if this absurd scene was her delusion of the dying process or did it mean some kind of change by the system? Of course, she hoped for the latter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment the man sitting on the high place said, “You are fully qualified. You are qualified enough to go back to the earth to kill more bad guys. Any objections?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nobody responded. She pricked her eyes at that. Back to the earth?<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Then, let me entrust that role to her.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having heard that, she thought to herself, ‘If so, send me back to the earth!’<br/><br/><br/><br/>There were too many bad guys she had not killed yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The building that fell from the sky struck down Admiral Baker’s fleet floating in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way! How could it…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was no way for them to avoid such a devastating attack. Their two airships were still smashed to pieces. Only Admiral Baker’s flagship barely avoided it using the special engine attached to the ship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>After destroying the two airships, the building fell over the place where the Chinese army had been camping out. It was also a place where dozens of flying weapons were stationed. All of them disappeared under the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhh…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it was just the beginning of a more intensive attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The building that was stuck upside-down slowly began to tilt to the side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh! It’s coming our way!” </div><h2 id="chapter326">Chapter 326</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>As things stood now, thousands of Chinese soldiers, who were lined up along the four-lane road, would be killed instantly, crushed under the building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get out of here right now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Everyone, run away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, a huge stream of water soared from the wall. It was the “high-grade water spirits” that had swept through the castle wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kugugugugu!<br/><br/><br/><br/>They swirled and flew toward the collapsing building. Then, with tremendous force, they supported it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quaguaguguagua!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Numerous concrete debris and bone fragments were scattered in all directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the hell are you doing? We are still at war!” General Xing shouted, stretching out his hand toward the building. “Come on, move again! Advance! Take over the enemy’s castle! Let me stop him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, General Xing’s wishful thinking went nowhere. He was still mistaken. He could never stop the Necromancer’s power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hundreds of undead troops were hung on the building that stopped collapsing thanks to a stream of water. They started jumping down all at once. It looked like airborne rangers were descending from a huge transport plane.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Furthermore, the giant ‘bone hands’ holding the building began to turn into thousands of ‘bone spears’ after being separated and scattering in the air. They rained down on the heads of the Chinese army like rain. It was an attack that the Necromancer launched by applying the skill .<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, my God…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Unfurl the shield right now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Chinese soldiers could not keep up their morale in the face of all sorts of bizarre phenomena unfolding right before their eyes. So, they desperately ran about to survive without remembering the general’s order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gugugugugugu-<br/><br/><br/><br/>And there was a creature running down the outer wall of the sagging building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was ‘Durahan’. That headless knight charged fiercely at the Chinese army, as if riding on a runaway, just like he did on a giant snake before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He’s coming our way!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The moment Durahan landed on the road, the ghost knight guard popped out from both sides as if his wings spread. Then they trampled on the embarrassed Chinese soldiers and moved on. It was a terrible slaughter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Such a heinous scene was a shock to the Korean server as well. While letting out a sigh of relief on the castle wall, they were amazed by what’s going on right before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, what’s going on all of a sudden?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow, I can’t believe it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the real spectacle just began.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The center of the building collapsed, creating a huge hole. And something bizarre popped out from the hole. It was so bizarre that even those Chinese soldiers running away stopped and looked at it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it, what the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We are finished!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was Bone Imoogi. That giant snake monster was coiled up inside the building for a long time. And the moment when the tide of the battle turned in favor of the Necromancer, the giant snake appeared. Its sudden appearance dealt a devastating blow to the morale of the enemies who already lost the will to fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bone Imoogi pushed its heavy body towards the Chinese military stationed on the four-lane road. It was as if a KTX train was running over a sidewalk crowded with people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Rattle! Rattle! Explosion!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sitting on top of Bone Imoogi’s head, Victor triggered a corpse explosion in the middle of the Chinese army.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Concrete fragments, bone spears, and an army of undead rained down on their heads, while Durahan and Bone Imoogi were pushing them hard like a tsunami from behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And a huge wall was standing before them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, a massacre was underway and none of them had a means of escape.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They should move faster.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Riding on Wyvern Alpha Male high in the sky, Sungwoo was controlling the situation, but he didn’t feel at ease.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Seoul is dangerous. I could save time because I pulled out a building and carried it here, but as things stand now, Jisu could be killed.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, like he said, there were always variables in a war, and the tide of the battle in Seoul was turning due to unexpected variables.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Reporter Ahn looked at the screen with his mouth wide open. His assistant covered his mouth with his hand. They were shocked by a series of events that they could not believe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Chinese troops in Busan were annihilated by a huge explosion that wiped out the city entirely, an overturned skyscraper of a building crashed over the Suwon battlefield, and Bone Imoogi popped out of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, at this moment, the screen of the official channel was showing not the fierce battlefield in Suwon, but one corner of Seoul because something important was taking place there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a road covered with blood on the battlefield in Seoul that the drone camera was showing now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That woman…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The assistant barely opened his mouth, but he couldn’t say any more. Then, Reporter Ahn stepped forward and wrapped it up with an important announcement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“She finally stood up again…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a variable in the fight that would turn its tide.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Bird of Washington, the only surviving airship and Admiral Baker’s flagship, was also involved in the battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Somebody is infiltrating the ship!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Take them out right now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although they barely avoided the building falling from the sky, several undead that got stuck to the building jumped over the airship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, our deck soldiers are fighting them, but they seem to be on the defensive right now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the airship boasted of strong firepower enough to break through the invisible barriers and walls, there were only 47 people aboard the ship. Among them were only thirty crew members who could actually fight, so it was impossible for them to respond properly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Our forces are being pushed by the enemy right now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You are the guards of the flagship! Don’t allow them into the ship!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They could barely hold out because some of them with fine capabilities were selected as crew members.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are coming over here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, they could not stop the undead from leaving the deck and heading to the flagship by stepping on the outer wall of the airship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? They are already here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, dozens of ghouls appeared on the window of the flagship, then swung their weapon-like hands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Clang! Clang! Clang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>When there were spiderweb-like cracks in the flagship’s glass window, everyone stood up in fear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, no!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We can’t stop them from coming inside!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But Admiral Baker was still sitting in the chair, never unmoved by their fuss.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon three rifles slowly floated behind his back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Admiral?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Admiral! Please give us an order!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Admiral Baker’s eyebrows wriggled when somebody demanded.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Keep fighting! If you can’t, step aside.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His order was pretty irresponsible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crack!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eventually, the window was smashed. Dozens of ghouls infiltrated the control room where the admiral was sitting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The crew began to flee, screaming. But they couldn’t be faster than the ghouls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They swept over the crew members, and the flagship with the control room not functioning properly began to tilt sharply.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Admiral Baker stood up to keep balance. At the same time, he aimed the three muzzles at the ghouls’ heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the muzzles fired in succession, the skulls of the three ghouls shattered to pieces.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the fragmented skulls started to regenerate quickly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Admiral Baker frowned and shouted, “Disgusting…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then he reloaded the three rifles. Of course, it was not real bullets that filled the powder chamber. A circular figure appeared around the cylinder part and rotated to supply mana.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhh! Go away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Help me, Admiral!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>With almost all of the crew members slaughtered, Admiral Baker alone was standing tall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Tut, tut, just useless guys…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mumbling like that, the admiral snapped his fingers. Then, an ammunition band he made with magic from behind came up. They were connected to the rifles that floated in the air.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, a support made of magic near the shoulder soared to fix the rifles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Even though you occupied America, you can take over my flagship.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon the three muzzles began to fire at the ghouls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang! </div><h2 id="chapter327">Chapter 327</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>He used a skill that allowed him to shoot randomly without reloading bullets for a certain amount of time. It was as though Admiral Baker’s body became a machine-gun battery.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kheeeek! Kheeeeeeek!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Showered with the bullets the admiral fired in succession, the ghouls couldn’t approach him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The fragmented bodies of ghouls bounced off in all directions, and the instrument panel of the control room was smashed to pieces.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Disgusting bastards!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Admiral Baker, whose face always stayed expressionless, finally began to show emotions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was upset.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get out of my place right now!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ghouls aimed at the admiral using their characteristic anomalous mobility, but he didn’t allow them to approach him. He looked like a human turret himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment the admiral made the mistake of missing a very small undead who secretly approached him, with his head down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a goblin skeleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The goblin was lying on his face, five or six steps away from the admiral, holding a long sword.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Admiral Baker hurriedly moved the rifle behind his back to fire at the goblin, but he cleverly threw his body to escape the bullet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The little monster suddenly got close to the admiral. He tilted the muzzle to aim at the ghoul’s head. He could not aim at the ghoul accurately because he could not put the rifle on his shoulder right. So, the admiral hurriedly stepped back and pulled out a “hand cannon” from his waist, and pulled the trigger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>He hit the ghoul, but the bullet smashed only a few of his ribs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crackle!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ghoul stopped for a moment, then approached him right away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Get out of here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Admiral Baker threw away a hand cannon that needed to be loaded, then pulled out a self-defense knife. He thought of widening the gap with the little monster to aim at him accurately, then shot it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>But right before colliding with the admiral, the goblin skeleton abandoned the sword, and pulled out a ‘hand cannon’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Admiral Baker stared blankly at the muzzle. The hand cannon was aimed at his head!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was now put on the defensive by the cunning monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The shotgun blew off Admiral Baker’s head. With his head smashed to pieces, the admiral collapsed from the seat where he was sitting loftily until a little while ago.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The control room became quiet in an instant. All the crew members of the flagship, including the admiral, were annihilated. And somebody walked on the deck, breaking the silence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Finished already?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was Sungwoo. He ordered the ghouls to search inside the messy control room. He also made sure that the ghouls should double-check the body of Admiral Baker, who lost his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result, he could collect an unusual object in the admiral’s pocket.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Angel?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was an angel doll the size of a palm.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You have acquired the enemy camp’s item ‘Angel’s Statue (Sign of Blessing)’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* This is a special reward given only to the high-ranking people belonging to the Angel camp. If you go to the ‘symbol (World Tree)’ of your camp, you can exchange it for a ‘camp Item.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo thought, ‘This is the statue that the King of the Great Mountain has mentioned.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Actually, that’s the message that the king sent to Sungwoo through somebody helping him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to the message, if Sungwoo could get a total of two statue-like objects and take them to the world tree, he would get something very important.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alright, I’ve obtained one!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Perhaps the other one would be in Gen. Xing’s hands.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Let me go to Suwon and finish the battle there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the tide of the war was turned in favor of the enemy, General Xing didn’t give up yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In his judgment, he could reverse the situation again.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>‘If we keep the status quo and wait for the arrival of our reinforcements in Seoul, we can get victory buffs and counterattack.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The latest news he heard from his men in Seoul was that his forces there were about to annihilate the remnants of the Korean server. After that, he had no chance to get updated about the latest status of the battle in Seoul because of the Necromancer’s air raid, but he had no doubt that the reinforcements from Seoul would soon arrive in Suwon because his forces virtually won overwhelmingly there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘We should hold out until they arrive here. We can win if we hold out.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>He opened the rest of the ‘spirit control’ boxes, and controlled a total of four ‘high-grade water spirits.’ They intertwined over the sky of the battlefield and shook like raging waves. When the general lifted his head, he felt like he was standing in the middle of a storm in the ocean.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kheeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, be angrier. Turn your anger to my enemies!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The power that surpassed a natural disaster was in the general’s hands. He reached out his hand. Then, a huge wave swept over Bone Imoogi that was racing toward him like a heavy train.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The train could not beat the waves. Bone Imoogi lost his balance and began to step back. Suddenly, the giant snake looked helpless like a snake trapped in a ditch on a rainy day.<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing clenched his hand, stretching out his hand toward Bone Imoogi. Then the waves soared and rotated, gradually turning into a huge whirlpool.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my God! What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, this war is crazy!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The players on the battlefield were forced to turn their heads for a while even during the fierce battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kheeeeeeeeeeeh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, the waves were not just a simple whirlpool. While rotating, the water spirits’ arms extended outward long, revealing their sharp claws.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, they ground everything caught in it like a rotating saw blade. Concrete buildings on both sides of the road were no exception.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Avoid them! If you get closer, you will get sucked inside!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Aside from the building that the Necromancer brought here, this huge whirlpool was getting rid of everything that stood in its way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Bone Imoogi could not maintain his shape inside the whirlpool no matter how strong he was.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The scene of the giant snake monster dozens of meters tall being smashed to pieces was spectacular. Without the fall of the building, it would have been the best scene of this battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, this is the power of the continent.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the general was always prudent, he got carried away with his power this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Always a prudent General Singh, but this time he was intoxicated by his strength.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, except for the emperor who controls the river, nothing can go against the power of Mother Nature.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Water has always been an object of fear to humans. Throughout human history, everybody tried to control water in one way or another, but the moment they lost control of it, everything was swept away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Water is unpredictable and destructive, above all. What if somebody can control that terrifying creature easily?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’m sure it’s going to be the best weapon.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing became convinced that he could reverse the situation using water spirits. He thought he could hold out in the current situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment when he was stepping forward confidently, a red warning sign stopped him out of nowhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘spirit (high-grade water spirits)’ under your control becomes incapacitated due to a fatal problem.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Panicked, the general lifted his head toward the massive whirlpool, and witnessed something unbelievable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That huge whirlpool was freezing very quickly. The dynamic waves stopped moving firmly, and the huge water droplets swelled, then became a huge ice barrier like an Antarctic ice wall.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way! This can’t happen! How can you freeze the high-grade water spirits?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The spirit was different from normal water. Since it had strong mana, the water spirit could not be frozen by default even if it was attacked by freezing magic. </div><h2 id="chapter328">Chapter 328</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>General Xing turned his head to look for the epicenter of the unbelievable freezing magic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that? No way!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And he realized it wasn’t just the freezing magic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He saw Bone Wyvern floating in the air, and the Necromancer standing behind it. He was holding a uniquely shaped rifle. And a peculiar wave was emanating from the object.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a sorcerer himself, General Singh was able to sense the power. It was definitely ‘Frozen Seed’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nonsense! This can’t happen!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing was aware of the existence of the ‘Frozen Seed’ for a long time. It was found after some sort of “Hidden Quest” in Siberia took place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The royal bodyguards of the Emperor attempted to airlift the ‘Frozen Seed’ to neutralize the Server- 2’s sorcerer, but they failed because they lost the ‘Frozen Seed’ in transit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After that, however, the Siberian hunters recovered the item, but the general knew that they were robbed of the frozen seed by the Necromancer in the battle in Seoul.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But how is he controlling the frozen seeds?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The problem was that the Necromancer was controlling that formidable item like a personal weapon as if it was a rifle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing was also familiar with the destructive power of the frozen seed, which was widely known to be out of human control. It was to be used in a fixed position, so it was inevitable for its user to suffer damage, too.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Moreover, when the frozen seed was planted, a warning message appeared. So, all they had to do was to avoid the place as soon as they planted it. So, the general didn’t worry about it too much.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“How can he use it freely like a rifle? What kind of skill is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing stepped back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I’ve lost. I can’t win this battle.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He stretched out his hand to withdraw the high-grade water spirits that were drying up gradually.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he moved them under his own feet, climbed on top of them, and held his position as if riding the waves. Then, he soared in the air with the waves and began to leave the battlefield at terrific speed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Alright. Let me find a way to survive first then gather the remaining troops and the reinforcements from Seoul…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Puck!<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, he could not carry out his next plan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He lost his balance because something got stuck in his ankle. He rolled under the waves and fell to the asphalt at the edges of the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ahhhhhhhhh!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>While groaning, he looked down at his ankles. He saw a dagger stuck in it. And he felt his body gradually becoming paralyzed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Shit! He even used paralysis magic…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, someone was walking towards him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if doing some sort of ceremony, that man was approaching him with a weird dance, dressed in a bizarre style.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nice shot! I’ve got him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He wore a gigantic iron helmet that had nothing to do with any cosmetic effects, with six arms. And a sacred halo that didn’t fit him was all over his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Nihao! Mama hoo! Ni huga zenguo cha ma?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He even used strange language, which created a fear of a different nature that the general had never experienced.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The stranger approached the general and smiled at him, shrugging.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, actually, I don’t know what I am talking about. I picked up some Chinese words while sleeping during the Chinese lesson in high school. But I tried to look friendly to you, so please understand me.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You’re crazy!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Scared, General Xing tried to get up, but he couldn’t because his lower body was paralyzed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck are you talking about? Who the hell are you!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The stranger smiled at him then spat out something terrible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t you recognize me at first glance?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>General Xing shook his head because he couldn’t tell. The stranger scratched his nose with his third arm on the left then laughed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if he understood, the stranger said, “I’m an assassin!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Assassin?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t think you can believe me, but my specialty is assassination.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Go away, you crazy bastard! I am a general! Let me die with honor!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, don’t worry about that. Not long ago, I let Vladimir perish with great honor.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Who the hell are you talking about? Who is Vladimir?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if lost in reminiscing, the stranger said, “Well, it’s a hamster!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>After all, the general was killed without any honor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the general’s water spirits were neutralized, the Korean server launched an offensive attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Crusader Team, who were devoted to the defense of the holes of the castle wall, charged at the enemy, and the World Tree camp players, who had been inevitably holed up inside the invisible barriers to get out of the striking range of the enemy, also resumed fierce attacks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The tide of the battle has turned! Let’s destroy them!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Chinese army already suffered enormous casualties and lost their commander, so they could no longer resist. After all, they began to disperse without any central figure leading them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“They are running away!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“We’ve won!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly after the Necromancer appeared, the allies seized the opportunity to win the battle in Suwon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Damn it! It’s not over yet! We have to finish the battle quickly and join our allies in Seoul! Chase the remnant Chinese soldiers and kill them all!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although they virtually won, they were impatient because the allies were left alone, isolated in the Seoul battlefield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If they are still holding out in Seoul, it is a miracle…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since Sungwoo was not yet briefed about the status of the allies’ fight in Seoul, he had no choice but to worry.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly afterward, a “reunion portal” opened on one side of the battlefield in Seoul, the final battlefield<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The ‘victor (Korea server)’ of the Suwon and Busan battlefields has joined the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* The ‘Battlefield Victory Buff (Phase 2)’ has been issued to the Korean server. (Temporarily increase all stats +15)<br/><br/><br/><br/>A number of troops, including Sungwoo, came out of the portal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What the heck is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they came out, they immediately found a huge number of corpses on the streets of Seoul, about 400 people when counted. All of them were Chinese soldiers with all their heads cut.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘They were beheaded with one stroke…’ Sungwoo murmured.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The bodies were all lying in the same direction, and the bloodstains were also drawn in the same trajectory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Who could do this?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>As far as Sungwoo knew, no one could do this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh my …what happened?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although Sungwoo heard what happened here through the broadcast, what he actually saw here could not be more bizarre.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, someone shouted at Sungwoo. When he turned my head, someone was sitting on the railing on the roof of a building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, we’re here!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was the King of the Great Mountain. Dressed in a blood-stained white robe, he was biting a pipe in his mouth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You are late! Too late!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was smiling at Sungwoo in a relaxed mood although he seemed exhausted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You failed to come here at the decisive moment unlike me when I did in Pyongyang. Necromancer, you are not that cool this time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Giggling at him, he lifted the pipe and pointed it somewhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This time she is really cool!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head to the place the king was pointing at.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the end of the 8-lane street where the enemies’ bodies were strewn was an unusually large heap of bodies, for the strong army under General Xing, who believed he would join them, were slaughtered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, there were three shadows standing there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-You are facing the deity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Deity?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was confused by an unexpected message.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No way…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The one with the deity status was wearing dark red armor. The black wings carved all over her body were impressive. And all those wing patterns were covered with sticky blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Jisu? She is Jisu, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like Hanho said, she was Jisu. And the two tigers who were thought to have been killed were standing next to her. But their bodies were somewhere opaque. A ray of light was connected to her body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Are they her subordinate spirits?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two tigers looked like her subordinate spirits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It looks like you guys have a deep relationship with death,” said the king, puffing off smoke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was the birth of “Valkyrie,” the messenger of death, referring to Jisu, and “Einherier,” the warrior who went through death. </div><h2 id="chapter329">Chapter 329</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The three battles between the Chinese server and the Korean server came to an end as the final battle in Seoul was won by Jisu, or Valkyrie.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In no time a message announcing the end of the war appeared before everyone through the official channel screen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“It’s all over,” said Reporter Ahn with a sigh of relief.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every battle in Busan, Suwon, and Seoul was fierce. So, broadcasting the fierce battles in three places made him exhausted as if he was fighting on the battleground.<br/><br/><br/><br/>His assistant who was next to him shouted for joy belatedly, clenching his fists as if he could feel relaxed after a long time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Wow! Finally, our Korean server has won!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Reporter Ahn nodded but added something as if he wanted to correct his assistant’s comment a bit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes, our server has won. More precisely, maybe the Necromancer has proved it again. In other words, our server can’t exist without him!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His assistant clapped his hands, nodding at him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah! Certainly, we have to say that the Necromancer has turned the tide of the war decisively not only at the just-ended battle with the Chinese server but also at the recent war between the Korean server and the Japanese server, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You bet. Of course, this time, the swordsman named Jisu played a huge role. She held out with an extremely small number of allies on the Seoul battlefield until the Necromancer arrived, and actually, it was no exaggeration to say she deserved the credit for ending the final phase of the Seoul battle.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His assistant kept nodding at Reporter Ahn’s commentary.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She was really cool. In some respects, her fighting was horrible, but at the same time beautiful. Depending on who saw it, her beheading the Chinese troops might look cruel. I don’t know what kind of skill it was, but she beheaded several hundreds of them all at once. To be honest, I’ve become this lady, or Valkyrie’s, fan today.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Me, too. Hmm, anyway….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Reporter Ahn adjusted his posture and stared at her camera. Although the war was over, tens of thousands of viewers were still watching the broadcast. It was time for him to give a closing comment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, it is not the end yet. From now on, there is something we need to pay attention to. It’s also very important.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is that?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Reporter Ahn paused for a moment, then said, “This war will not end at this point.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although his speculation often proved wrong, he spoke confidently because he had some conviction this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Really? Do you think we’re going to go through another big event?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Think about it. Since we were attacked like this, isn’t it time for us to counterattack?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can you elaborate?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If you look at Korean history, our people mostly ended up defending our country when they were attacked by foreign powers. But the Necromancer won’t walk the same path. He will definitely take revenge on the intruders in a big way.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His assistant swallowed, then asked, “Well, do you mean it’s time for our Korean server to attack the Chinese server?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That’s right. And our Korean server will be at the crossroads, depending on when the Necromancer will attack China.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Korean server has already come under the shadow of the World Tree camp and united as one. So, every matter of the Korean server was supposed to be influenced by what kind of choice the Necromancer would make.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“And I am totally convinced that the Necromancer will prevail this time, too.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>And most of the time Reporter Ahn trusted the Necromancer’s choice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The leadership of the WPU watched the war between the Chinese server and the Korean server from the beginning. Although they could not directly help the Korean server because they could not afford to, the World Tree camp was the most important ally of the WPU.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, the more they knew about that ally, the more they couldn’t understand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Hey Johnny, did I see something wrong?” Chairman Love asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jonathan, who was sitting next to her, said with a blank expression, “Chairman, that’s what I want to ask you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chairman Love swept her face with his hand, then said, “To be honest, I don’t know what I’ve seen. Was war like that by nature? Am I mistaken about the concept of war?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No. What we have just seen was obviously different from other kinds of war. I would say it’s something like an epic tale on the literature of medieval knights.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>How could the fate of war be decided by a couple of men? This was totally unrealistic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, such a situation happened many times on the Korean server. The big explosion in Busan, the fall of a building in Suwon, and the massacre in Seoul. All of them were just unbelievable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He told me before he left that he would come back with more power to stop the Dragon on the occasion of this war. What he said was right!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was amazement as well as hope in her eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“If the Necromancer’s ambition is true, this is only the beginning. I don’t think he will be satisfied with what he has achieved this time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You are right. He will definitely attack the Chinese server. And what he’s going to do is not start a war with them…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chairman Love turned her head and looked out the window. The worst creature was breathing somewhere in the sky in the south.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“He’s going to prepare for the end of the world.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>How to stop the dragon? Finally, the secret way to stop the Dragon, which she could not find no matter how hard she thought about it, began to come to light.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Maybe he can really kill the Dragon and save us.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><br/><br/>The battlefield in Seoul was quiet after the battle was over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, there are so many things to do in the aftermath of this fierce battle where we risked our lives,” Kyungsoo lamented.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though they won the war, they could not have a comfortable break.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They could not put off cleaning up the mess and checking the situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking at the chart showing the status of the post-war situation, he sighed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Busan has been devastated, but we have 4000 Chinese prisoners of war, including 1000 from Suwon and 3000 from Seoul. Man, they are more troublesome than the damages to our forces.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The war was fierce, so the allied forces killed a huge number of enemies. However, at the last minute when the enemy lost the will to fight, they kept surrendering. The allied forces could not kill them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Minhum came up with a typical method to deal with the prisoners.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I think we should empty the coal mine in Mt. Pukhan. It looks like we need to release the guys from the Evolution Society that we have detained there.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They were so-called “unpaid coal mine slaves.” The coal mine was the right place to accept those who committed war crimes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, you mentioned that Mt. Pukhan had mining terrain, right? How many can you accept in that place?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, they have only dug three tunnels, so we can make only 1,000 people work per day. However, I have heard there are several mine terrains in Gangwon Province where the Struggle Guild main base used to be.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, then, I have to ask the King of the Great Mountain about it. Let me tell Sungwoo about it first. We need to find a place for them to work endlessly.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yes. At least they have to work if they want to get meals. These days food is so precious…” </div><h2 id="chapter330">Chapter 330</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>After checking out the situation, the Liberation Guild decided to take over the post-war reconstruction of Seoul and manage the prisoners there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo and the rest of his party opened the ‘hyper gate’ to return to Suwon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, I’m so tired. Whew! We can take a break now, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, me, too. I want to take a break.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even Jisu complained she was too tired. In fact, the fiercest ever fight was over. It was natural that they were exhausted while feeling finally relaxed after the war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mir already fell asleep in Sungwoo’s arms. Everyone was desperate for a break.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Why don’t you guys take a break? I thought all of you were having a sound sleep by now,” Hanho said. Like he said, everybody was still at work in the Suwon village even after the war was over. There were trucks with lots of loads driving here and there. They had already begun to restore the broken walls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soon, Muyon, who was checking at the collapsed wall, discovered Sungwoo’s party and approached them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, you are here! Thank you all. You guys really had a great fight.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>There was relief and relaxation in Muyon’s expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, why are you not taking a break?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, non-combat personnel can still work. So, we’re trying to temporarily repair a large broken hole. It won’t take long, so we’re going to take a break after we’re done.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>If Muyon could use the “automatic construction” function, the restoration work would not be hard. Actually, he could repair three holes without any big difficulty.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Even though we have won, we never know what will happen all of a sudden, right? Our castle wall exists just in case.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo nodded at his words. Somebody like Muyon who had a sense of responsibility was essential for the wellbeing of the organization.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay. By the way, thanks to the wall, you could hold out for a long time. It’s really fortunate for you to have built the castle wall in advance,” said Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Muyon smiled at him for his praise.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But I need to reinforce the wall a bit more. In fact, it collapsed earlier than I thought. The moment the wall collapsed, it was really a close call for all of us here.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Chinese bombing, led by Admiral Baker, was stronger than expected. So much so that not only the invisible barriers but also the wall collapsed like a sandcastle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was evident that if they had not built a wall, they would not have held out long and their village would have been devastated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Now, don’t worry about us. Just go and take a rest.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, I guess so.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo was also so tired that he couldn’t stand anymore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo’s party headed to the main building of the World Tree camp, namely the old museum building. Then, they dispersed to their own quarters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the entrance of Sungwoo’s personal office was hung a nameplate called “Server Master’s Room”. It seemed that the general affairs department put it up even though they were busy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, I’ve never been so tired like this before…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He felt his whole body tingle, but he still had work to do before taking a rest as the “server master”. In fact, it wasn’t a big deal. He needed to confirm all sorts of reward messages that he had slept on for a while. The first he confirmed was the message about the ‘acquisition of the title’ that always increased his capabilities substantially.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The title ‘War Hero (Level 2)’ has been replaced with the title ‘War Hero (Level 3)’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All stats increase (+5)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since he obtained the title after winning the 1st and 2nd Korean-Japanese wars, he obtained one for the third time, which increased his stats enormously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He said, “Open player profile.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Player Profile]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Sungwoo Yu<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Level: 23<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Job: Necromancer, Black Wizard<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Ability: Muscle strength (44+13), Agility (31+11), Stamina (37+15)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Gold Reserves: 338,500,412<br/><br/><br/><br/>He slowly looked at his profile with stiff eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘I usually have 57 muscle strength. In addition to this, all my stats increase by 25, including 10 from the Lich effect and 15 from the Anubis effect…Then my muscle strength is 82…’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo pulled out the myth-grade item “Heavy Bow”, which he had previously obtained from a secret shop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Item information]<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Name: Heavy Bow<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Grade: Myth<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Category: Bow<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Effect: An ordinary person can never pull it. (Condition for using: 100 or more muscle strength)<br/><br/><br/><br/>*When you pull a bow, an arrow is automatically generated, and the “sun fall” skill is activated at the striking point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>+ Fall of the sun: Causes a wide range of explosions and flame magic near the striking point. Care must be taken because it can destroy the whole area. (Cooldown: 10 days)<br/><br/><br/><br/>+ Unconfirmed set effect: Triggered when possessing Heavy Arrow<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo tried pulling it with force, but he could hardly pull the heavy bow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a matter of fact, Sungwoo’s grip was strong enough to break even a steel bar, but he needed 18 more muscle strength points in order to pull this properly. It was literally so heavy that he didn’t know how to use it. Anyway, it was useless for now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“As expected, this was a necessary evil…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo confirmed another message.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-‘Victory Reward’ is given to the ‘Server Master’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* War Prize: 300,000,000 Gold<br/><br/><br/><br/>“300 million gold…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Strictly speaking, he got much more gains than losses from this war. The gold he gained by beating the enemy, the items he obtained from the defeated enemy, and the airships laid the foundation for the growth of the Korean server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But he was not satisfied with the 300 million gold as a reward when tens of thousands’ lives were at stake in this war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But that wasn’t the end of the message.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The Korean server will be given an ‘opportunity of counterattack (leadership)’ against ‘the other party (Chinese server)’<br/><br/><br/><br/>* When you decide to counterattack, you can take the initiative and decide on the ‘battlefield’ and ‘the type of war’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* You can decide to end the war with the server master’s authority. (The war ends without any additional reward in that case.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-If you decide to counterattack within 48 hours, the ‘counterattack’ effect is given to all your allies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* All stats increase (+3)<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Moving speed increases (+10%)<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘A counterattack effect? Alright. The system wants me to go after the Chinese server and completely destroy them.’<br/><br/><br/><br/>If the system wanted him to attack China, he was going to follow it at least for now because he didn’t have any intention of saving this bastard called the Emperor of the Chinese server.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But this is not the right time.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo decided to put off that decision for a while. If he chose to counterattack, the message that he would resume war would obviously appear before their eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The war just ended. So, he needed to let his troops relax without worrying about another war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo put the message aside for now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“By the way, how long should I fight like this?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>For the first time, he felt he was sick and tired of fighting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘Why?’<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo took a nap, but he woke up three hours later when Kyungsoo visited him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sungwoo, I checked everything as you said, but I didn’t see anything like that little statue. But if I discover something, I’ll let you know right away.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kyungsoo searched General Xing’s personal belongings, but he could not find the second statue, “Sign of Blessing.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>‘If so, there is a high possibility that it’s kept in Beijing, China. They know it’s important, but they must have kept it in a safe place because it’s helpful in battle.’ </div><h2 id="chapter331">Chapter 331</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sungwoo called Kyungsoo who was about to leave the room.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Kyungsoo, keep General Xing’s body separately. Make sure no one has access to it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Sure, will do.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo needed to confirm what happened through the ‘memory fragments’ of the general’s body. He could not go back to sleep once he woke up, so he put down Mir, who was sound asleep, then came out. It was already dark, but the inside of the World Tree camp was filled with blue light, the brilliant ray emanating from the world tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? Has he woke up already?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The King of the Great Mountain was sitting on the great roots of the square. As expected, he was puffing up the smoke of his big pipe, as usual.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can tell you confidently that if you work so hard like that, you will die even if you don’t fight in the battle.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king presented something to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Alright. Just eat this one and give one to Jisu. She could survive miraculously, but she was engaged in such a fierce battle that she must be suffering from serious aftereffects beyond just being tired.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a dumpling-shaped item, which was effective for stamina and rejuvenation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, Sungwoo wanted to discuss something with the king.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I need to talk with you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king was very much embarrassed at his unexpected request for a meeting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In fact, Sungwoo had something he wanted to ask the king for a long time, but he kept putting it off because he was so absent-minded until now, so he thought this was the right moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is it? You make me scared!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo put his hand in the pocket, then held the scales of Imoogi with his hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-OFF AIR (-)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Can’t you see me?” Sungwoo asked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, I am afraid of your eyes.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king came down from the roots with an awkward expression.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then, he followed Sungwoo with an embarrassed expression as if he was dragged like a prisoner then entered the Server Master’s Room.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, why do you want to talk to me at this late hour in the night?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I want to ask you about Valkyrie, namely Jisu’s deity.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king’s expression became bright at that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh yeah! She was really cool. You should have watched her at that moment. It was a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Did you help her play that role?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>His bright expression hardened at once.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh? What are you talking about?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He scratched the back of his neck and avoided Sungwoo’s gaze.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“That sword, the Viking sword used by Jisu, was one of the conditions for her getting deity status. She told me you gave it to her, so stop pretending not to know about it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo has been suspicious of the king for a long time. As a former monster, he helped her achieve Awakening, and he even gave Sungwoo some warning just like Imoogi had done before. Obviously, the king did all this because he knew something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What’s his real identity?<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king laughed heartily at Sungwoo’s words, which was also enough to make him look more suspicious.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, the world has more coincidences than you think. If you try to connect all of them, you just get confused all the more,” the king said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Coincidence?” Sungwoo asked with a smile. “Do you think this crazy world was made by coincidences? You know you are not here by mere accident, right?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, is it fate, then?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“No, this is manipulation.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a problem that he didn’t have to worry about. After this world turned into a game, or maybe even long before that, there was probably no coincidence or fate in this world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In other words, everything was thoroughly being manipulated by someone, for some purpose.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Where do you come from and for what purpose are you here? Tell me, king of monsters!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if Sungwoo touched his soft spot, the king frowned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Monster… Obviously, his identity was a monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king nodded with a very serious expression, then said, “Yes, I want to know that too. Didn’t I tell you at our first meeting? Why am I here? And the voice that is ringing in my head is not a voice…Should I call it revelation? I don’t know what it is.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>This time Sungwoo frowned and said, “What is that voice? As you said last time, is it really something like God?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo didn’t believe in God throughout his life. Since the game began, however, there was no other reasonable inference than the one that God punished the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, God? I just wonder what’s the concept of God. It’s the most incomprehensible…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I don’t feel like punning now. You really don’t know?”Sungwoo asked aggressively. He was impatient because he wanted to ask the king as much as possible while they were OFF-AIR.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, the king nodded with a long sigh.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I just don’t know, but….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suddenly, the king twisted his body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Feeling uneasy, Sungwoo turned his head.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And a familiar message rang.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-뀕궭$%%%<a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6e482e" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>긝!(%67#)<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Shhh!$!$%$$##%!!&amp;*<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The connection to the client-server has been terminated due to a fatal error. (ERROR CODE:0014231532)<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This one is…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the message slowly faded away, the king raised his head. More precisely, his eyes were different.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, I know…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Right now, someone on the other side of the system was staring at Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Yeah, Sungwoo, I understand that you have lots of questions. But what you are doing now ignores a big risk facing you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo looked straight into his eyes. Eventually, he encountered an unidentified helper.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sungwoo slowly said, “Who are you?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“I can’t tell you,” he replied firmly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo felt that he could never get his answer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, he changed the question.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Then, who am I?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a difficult question. In a ridiculous situation where the world turned into a game, it was natural for him to doubt his own existence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a matter of fact, even Sungwoo agonized over whether this was reality or he was like a ‘brain in a barrel’.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As if he understood Sungwoo’s question, the king just smiled, which was an artificial lifeless smile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“You are just you. Don’t worry about it.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Should he feel relaxed about this kind of reply?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“This world, including you, is a natural being. You can just think that you have been invaded by the outside world. And you just have to believe that I’ll help you achieve liberation.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although he got confused, Sungwoo didn’t reply.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“But, as I said earlier, I’ve no time to satisfy your curiosity. As you know, I won’t be here long, but let me give you one more important piece of advice.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Advice?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Don’t forget that my advice has always been valid, so listen to me well. A little later, someone will come to you.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>He held out his head and approached Sungwoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then he whispered, “Kill that man.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>That was the last word the king left behind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-The system has been urgently restored.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The king dropped his head right away as if he fainted. Then, he put his head down on the desk.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Oh, it aches!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that moment, Sungwoo heard somebody’s footsteps in the hallway. Like the king said, someone came. Sungwoo moved his hand and grabbed the hand cannon in the waist.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rattle-<br/><br/><br/><br/>Somebody quickly opened the door without knocking.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Well, Sungwoo!”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was Kyungsoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sugnwoo was embarrassed because he was advised by the king to kill the one who came to him. Was it Kyungsoo? No way!<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Uh, that’s….”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kyungsoo took turns looking at the king, who grabbed his head with his head down, and Sungwoo with a terrible expression. It looked like Sungwoo punched the king hard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Ah, was I rude?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“What is going on, Kyungsoo?” Sungwoo asked, suppressing a sense of alertness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Junghoon has come here with his Crusader Team members. He says he needs to talk to you urgently, so he wants you to come down right now…”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Someone that Sungwoo had to kill like the king said was Junghoon, not Kyungsoo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Man, if this is what you mean, you are now making fun of me…” </div><h2 id="chapter332">Chapter 332</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                            Kill Junghoon and the Crusader Team?<br/><br/>‘Aren’t you supposed to tell me why?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo was embarrassed. How could the king advise him to kill the person who visited him without telling him the exact reason?<br/><br/>He was angry. The king said he was helping Sungwoo to collapse the system, but Sungwoo wondered if the king was making fun of him.<br/><br/>‘No, I should not be emotional.’<br/><br/>So, he tried to suppress his emotions and think as rationally as possible.<br/><br/>‘Let me stop thinking he is playing with me. Right now, I’m in an important situation. There is clearly some reason for me to kill him.’<br/><br/>Since the system inside the cave of the giant snake monster Imoogi encountered an error, this was the third time Sungwoo contacted Junghoon. And this ‘unidentified helper’ has never given him any wrong advice until now.<br/><br/>Perhaps the king gave him only a fragment of the information, hard-pressed for time. The king had to avoid the eyes of the system to do this, which was not simple at all.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>‘I have no choice but to trust him right now. Okay, let’s assume it’s absolutely necessary for me to kill Junghoon and the Crusader Team, and it will not be difficult for me to kill them. This is my main base anyway.’<br/><br/>However, the question was why he should kill them all.<br/><br/>‘His advice that I should kill them unconditionally means they are very dangerous. Why are they?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo agonized over it briefly, but he couldn’t figure out why Junghoon was dangerous. As a matter of fact, he had been the most reliable ally and the most important helper to Sungwoo.<br/><br/>If so, there was only one thing Sungwoo could handle the best way, which was he should take extreme caution, assuming Junghoon and the Crusade Team were dangerous.<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at Kyungsoo and asked, “Kyungsoo, where is the Crusader Team right now?”<br/><br/>Kyungsoo turned his head out of the window.<br/><br/>“They have just arrived, so they’re coming this way. They have probably passed the castle wall by now. I hear they landed outside the village because of the invisible barrier. I wonder why he hasn’t asked you to open it…”<br/><br/>Fortunately, they hadn’t yet arrived at the center of the town.<br/><br/>“From now on, I won’t allow anybody except for the World Camp members to enter the center of the village. Don’t let them approach the world tree and watch out. I’m going out a little later.”<br/><br/>Kyungsoo said, tilting his head, “Watch out?”<br/><br/>“They are not yet part of our camp. And they were once our enemy. We should put our village, and the world tree under the best possible security all the time.”<br/><br/>At first, Kyungsoo looked puzzled at his words but soon nodded as if he understood.<br/><br/>“Got it. You’re right. No matter how much you ensure safety, it’s not enough.”<br/><br/>Then, he hastily disappeared out of the door.<br/><br/>Sungwoo stood up from his seat and began to grab weapons, while the king yawned while rubbing his eyes as he was having the aftereffect of having been possessed by a spirit.<br/><br/>“Well, I still don’t know anything about what’s going on in this world. How about you?”<br/><br/>The king asked with a sullen expression, sticking a pipe in his mouth. “Hmm, you contacted him because you insisted. Didn’t you get anything?”<br/><br/>He said, looking at the king, “Well, I came to know I was not a fake anyway.”<br/><br/>“Am I a fake then?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Grrrrrrrr-<br/><br/>At that moment, Mir woke up whining. It seemed that Mir was awakened by the sound of him picking up weapons. Mir yawned and raised his body, stretched his legs, then tried to snug back into Sungwoo’s arms.<br/><br/>“Why are you waking up at this moment?”<br/><br/>Sungwoo had no choice but to take Mir and climb to the rooftop of the museum.<br/><br/>‘They are already here.’<br/><br/>A group of men in full plate armor was approaching from a distance. They were a team of about 30 men including Junghoon and his Crusader Team members.<br/><br/>‘It’s strange that they came here without informing me in advance, but why is he bringing the fully armed Crusader team here?’<br/><br/>Sungwoo examined them slowly. Of course, Junghoon was standing in front of them.<br/><br/>‘He is different.’<br/><br/>Sungwoo frowned because he felt strange about Junghoon this time. He couldn’t know exactly why, but he could feel no more “aura” in Junghoon like before.<br/><br/>Kyungsoo and the village security guards stepped forward and stopped them. Just like Sungwoo ordered, they stopped Junghoon and his team from getting access to the center of the village where the world tree and art museum were located.<br/><br/>Then, something unexpected happened.<br/><br/>Grrrrrrrrrrr-<br/><br/>“Uh? What’s wrong?”<br/><br/>– Caution! The Fellblade has begun in the area.<br/><br/>All of a sudden Mir opened the Fellblade.<br/><br/>Pusheeeeeeee―<br/><br/>Black smoke erupted behind Sungwoo’s back. There were 6 chicken skeletons inside the smoke, whom Mir summoned.<br/><br/>Rattle! Rattle!<br/><br/>The bizarre skeletons jumped down the railing.<br/><br/>Puck! Puck! Puck!<br/><br/>It seemed that a few pieces of their bones were smashed and bounced off with a loud crash when they jumped, but they started to run somewhere without caring at all.<br/><br/>“Uh?”<br/><br/>In fact, their target was none other than the Crusader Team.<br/><br/>Rattle!<br/><br/>The chicken skeletons jumped to the ground and threw themselves at Junghoon’s head.<br/><br/>Junghoon immediately avoided them by turning his head, so one of the skeletons hit the face of the Crusader team member standing behind him.<br/><br/>“Argh!”<br/><br/>The attacked crew member grabbed his nose and hesitated. It was an absurd situation that they could not understand, so all of them opened their mouths in embarrassment.<br/><br/>“Catch them!”<br/><br/>At that moment, Kyungsoo and the guards hurriedly moved to capture the chicken skeletons. Even Hanho, who was passing by, rolled up his sleeves, stunned at the unexpected scenes.<br/><br/>“What’s going on? Why are chicken skeletons attacking humans? Where are you, Sungwoo? Stop them!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at Mir with a sigh. But Mir hissed toward the Crusaders’ team as if he was on alert, sticking out his head from Sungwoo’s arms.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this…Oh, you must have a reason to do something bad like this, right?”<br/><br/>Grrrrrr-<br/><br/>Sungwoo left the building. And he looked at the face of the team member who was hit by the chicken skeleton.<br/><br/>The scratches were clearly seen on his face as if he was scratched by the chicken skeleton’s claws. He made eye contact with Sungwoo then bowed his head.<br/><br/>‘His face had scratches, but he didn’t have any protective shield. Besides, there is no blood on his face.’<br/><br/>The Crusader team was supposed to be protected by a golden shield of their own. It was because of the characteristics of their job called “Crusaders.”<br/><br/>The shield was powerful enough to defend against any outsider’s attack, but why didn’t the shield take effect this time?<br/><br/>‘That shield is the Crusaders’ job trait. It makes no sense they could not trigger it in this situation. Then, these guys are not protected by the shield. Why?’<br/><br/>While narrowing the distance with Junghoon, Sungwoo began to check out everything he had taken for granted until now.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>There was nothing more foolish than believing something as it appeared at a time when people took the unrealistic situation for granted.<br/><br/>If so, Sungwoo had to break the existing assumption about Junghoon and his team members.<br/><br/>‘Are these guys the same men that I used to know? Yeah, I can understand this situation if these guys are not genuine Crusaders. That’s why they can’t spread the protective shield…’<br/><br/>Grrrrrr-<br/><br/>Sungwoo stroked Mir, who was growling at the Crusaders.<br/><br/>‘As a matter of fact, Mir didn’t act without any reason. He felt instinctively, or with some supernatural sense, that the other party was hostile before summoning the chicken skeletons to attack them.’<br/><br/>Come to think of it, what the unidentified helper told him was to kill a ‘certain visitor’, not Junghoon and the Crusaders.<br/><br/>Who were these visitors then?<br/><br/>‘This is a trap!’ </div><h2 id="chapter333">Chapter 333</h2><div class="w-100 font-serif text-base" id="chapterText">
                             <br/><br/>Sungwoo looked at Junghoon with a calm expression and said, “Junghoon, are you okay? Looks like one of your team members got hurt. Hanho, go and treat him.”<br/><br/>“Ah, well, it’s not a big deal. I can treat him with my sacred touch.”<br/><br/>Hanho approached the wounded team member, raising his arms high.<br/><br/>But Junghoon stopped Hanho with a naughty laugh.<br/><br/>“No, you don’t have to treat him. I’m rather embarrassed, but you don’t have to worry. It looks like the dragon has played with us roughly because he is still young. I’ve got more important business with you. As for the world tree over there, can I approach it for a closer look?”<br/><br/>His tone and expression were exactly the same as Junghoon’s. But Sungwoo could not feel any strong impression that he used to find in Junghoon. And he could confirm it when he examined Junghoon up close.<br/><br/>Although Sungwoo didn’t know about it exactly, such a strong impression had something to do with the so-called “aura of a war hero,” a passive effect given to the Crusader Commander.<br/><br/>‘As expected, this guy is dangerous.’<br/><br/>While walking one step closer to Junghoon, Sungwoo put his hand on the hand cannon in his waist.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>“But there is something you don’t know very well. This dragon can read into your mind more accurately than humans, although he is young.”<br/><br/>“I don’t understand what you are talking about…”<br/><br/>Instead of replying to him, Sungwoo pulled the hand cannon from his waist and raised the muzzle. Then, he aimed at a Crusader standing behind Junghoon.<br/><br/>Junghoon’s expression was distorted.<br/><br/>Bang!<br/><br/>The Crusader man’s head was smashed to pieces. The fragments of his skull scattered into the sky when it was smashed.<br/><br/>“Sungwoo, what the hell are you doing now?”<br/><br/>All the members of the World Tree camp including Hanho and Kyungsoo were astonished.<br/><br/>“Uh? What the heck is that?”<br/><br/>However, it didn’t take long for them too to realize something bizarre before their eyes.<br/><br/>It wasn’t the flesh and brain of the Crusader member’s head shattered by the hand cannon. It was something like pieces of clay or pottery. In other words, these guys standing before Sungwoo were not humans.<br/><br/>-You have earned 10,000 gold by killing the player’s ‘Superior Terracotta’.<br/><br/>The message that appeared before their eyes proved that Sungwoo’s judgment was correct. They were terracotta, or ‘earthenware dolls’.<br/><br/>When their identity was revealed, they stepped back, making a grotesque sound. Then, they dispersed in all directions, doing something like acrobatics like a circus member.<br/><br/>“What the heck is this?”<br/><br/>“Catch them!”<br/><br/>While the village security guards were moving around in confusion, some red lights lit up on their chests.<br/><br/>‘Red light? It’s a bomb. And their target is the world tree.’<br/><br/>In other words, their purpose was to commit terrorism against the world tree. Sungwoo pulled down the “winter predator” from his back and quickly raised the muzzle.<br/><br/>“Move back, everybody!” Sungwoo shouted.<br/><br/>Then, he lowered the lever, switched it to ‘expansion mode,’ and pulled the trigger at those running away in all directions.<br/><br/>He fired about 50 freezing bullets toward them. They spread like firecrackers and formed a fan shape.<br/><br/>They made bizarre movements to try to penetrate the world tree by all means, but none of them could escape the striking range of the ‘Winter Predator.’<br/><br/>They all turned into ice sculptures.<br/><br/>“Oh, my God…”<br/><br/>“If I hadn’t stepped back, I would have turned into ice!”<br/><br/>Sungwoo got rid of them all with one single attack.<br/><br/>Sungwoo broke one of the frozen terracotta. What came out of his body was a player manufacturing item in a round shape, which was obviously a type of bomb.<br/><br/>Sungwoo turned his head and looked at Kyungsoo.<br/><br/>“Kyungsoo, contact Yeongdeungpo right now and tell them that I’m in Suwon right now. Tell them I haven’t sent anybody to Suwon, so they should not allow any outsiders inside the village!”<br/><br/>If someone aimed at the World Tree camp using their alliance with the Korean server, there was a high possibility that they would try to get the same thing from the Liberation Guild in Youngdungpo.<br/><br/>“By the way, pass this message to all belonging to the Korean server!”<br/><br/>“Okay. I’ll do it right away.”<br/><br/>Furthermore, they may be targeting the entire Korean server right now.<br/><br/>“Damn it! I was going to take a good rest after this battle, but who the hell is doing this? Chinese server again?”<br/><br/>“I guess so…”<br/><br/>Sungwoo and his allies were complacent. Since the big battle was over, they thought that nothing unusual would happen until the next battle because both sides were exhausted.<br/><br/>However, since the Chinese emperor did not participate in the battle, he was not exhausted, but he did not seem to think of waiting leisurely until the next battle.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, he intended to deal a fatal blow to the Korean server in a very cunning way like this.<br/><br/>“I’m declaring an emergency as of now! Tighten the security of all areas! Everybody, follow my direction!”<br/><br/>Shortly afterward, the broadcast in the village rang, announcing that an emergency was declared throughout the Korean server, including the World Tree camp.<br/><br/>“Let me go and kick General Xing’s ass right now!”<br/><br/>After a brief break, Sungwoo entered the war again. The first thing he did was to collect the relevant information.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>General Xing’s body was stored in “Warehouse 0,” the most secure place.<br/><br/>Sungwoo stood in front of the warehouse.<br/><br/>-You can check the ‘memory fragments’ of the deceased.<br/><br/>When he resurrected the general’s body into a skeleton, he could see the video, as expected.<br/><br/>‘Good. Show me something useful.’<br/><br/>As always, the “memory fragments” of the enemy’s body would give him some clues.<br/><br/>Since the general was No. 2 in the Chinese server rankings, there could find some information that Sungwoo could use to ambush them.<br/><br/>When the video screen brightened, the first thing that caught Sungwoo’s eye was a wood fire. This was a room with a very large furnace. Sitting in front of the round table on one side was a man with a mustache. General Singh was drinking tea with that man face to face.<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>Strangely, they didn’t talk to each other. Instead, there was an awkward silence between them.<br/><br/>And the man with a mustache was staring at the general while sipping tea. Even though Sungwoo watched the guy through the general’s fragments of memory, he just felt that man’s glance was pretty annoying.<br/><br/>‘Something must be wrong.”<br/><br/>When Sungwoo noticed something strange, the man with a mustache smiled dismally.<br/><br/>“How are you?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“I’m saying hello to you!”<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Yes. This was not from memory. This mustache man was talking to Sungwoo in reality, not the owner of the fragments of memory.<br/><br/>“Psychometry?”<br/><br/>And this was a technique that put Sungwoo into trouble before. It was obvious that this guy had the ability of ‘psychometry’ like the White Wolf.<br/><br/>“Oh, you already know this. This is a very rare ability that only two have in mainland China. You guys have it on the Korean server?”<br/><br/>“…”<br/><br/>“Oh, you don’t speak much. Alright. We knew that you had the ability to read the information hidden in the corpse through the fragments of memory and that you would come to us like this. Even our Almighty Emperor humbly acknowledged the possibility that he might lose, so he prepared this in advance!”<br/><br/>This meant that the emperor did some trick on the general in advance for fear that he could be defeated in the war.<br/><br/>Since Sungwoo and his allies were stronger than any other force that they had dealt with, it seemed that the emperor moved, based on his men’s excellent intelligence network and human resources.<br/><br/>Finally, the guy with a mustache stood up from the table, with the teacup in his hand. </div>
