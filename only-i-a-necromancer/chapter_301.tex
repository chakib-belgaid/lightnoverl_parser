\section{chapter 301}

they were the "fragments" of hundreds of skeletons.
 entangled with each other, they were gliding back and forth in the air like a swarm of grasshoppers.
 then, they rushed toward the leftmost airship.





the baker's fleet hastily prepared for a follow-up attack, but their response was delayed as the thick layer of fog generated by the shelling from their battleships was blocking their view.
right at the moment, just before the collision, something with a clear, round shape popped out from the center of the bone tornado.
it was a fist, a huge one, made of bones.
.
.
bang!the fist struck an airship.
 the fist struck the shield surrounding its hull, but the whole airship jerked forward, and at the same time, numerous cracks occurred in its hull.
then, the airship lost its balance and started spinning round and round.
 the soldiers standing on the superstructure deck were thrown into the air.
"master! hahaha! they are moving like crazy! crackle! crackle!"the other airships hurried to turn their muzzles, but they could not fire easily because other airships blocked their view.
the weakness of the enemy battle line was revealed right here.
 the fleet was optimized to destroy enemies with solid defense and firepower, but they were slow and inefficient when they were within the striking range of their opponents.
 bang! bang! bang!after all, several muzzles managed to create the angle of fire and began to fire to slow down their opponent's attack.
 since the "giant's hand" was so bulky, they could hit it no matter how they fired, and the giant hand was destroyed more easily than they thought.
but the moment it was destroyed, the giant's hand made a strange movement.
 as if sprinkling blood, it threw its shattering fragments onto baker's fleet.
pitter-patter! pitter-patter!all sorts of terrible things flew over the fleet, such as bones, corpses, and blood.
'everything is going on smoothly as planned.
'in fact, the wyvern group carried the 'undead army' and the 'monster corpses' on their back.
and when the "giant's hand" was made, they were mixed up in that huge pile.

soon, the moment they scattered and covered the airship's shield, sungwoo shouted.
"corpse explosion!"bang! bang! bang! bang! bang! bang!in the past, corpse explosions alone could not break such a large-scale shield, but the shield was flickering uneasily after their power was greatly strengthened.
 a pile of bones blew away with the corpses of the monsters and poured into the gap of the broken shield.
rattle! rattle!those, which were mere fragments, were soon engulfed in black smoke and assembled into one, creating a heavy body.
"argh! what the heck is that?""respond to it right away!"the deck soldiers, who fell at the impact of the corpse explosions, crawled back in fear.
they could not keep their sanity because the "breath of abyss" arising from the corpse explosions settled on the deck.
 in the end, they had no choice but to allow the enemy's intrusion inside the ship once again.
that wasn't all.
"high-pressure explosion!"sungwoo used a "high-pressure explosion" that was four times more powerful than a normal corpse explosion.
-'high-pressure explosion' has been applied to 11 bodies.
 (29 seconds before the explosion)the corpses of the monsters that fell all over the airship began to swell like a balloon.
there were only thirty seconds left before the explosion, but there were not many on the deck to handle them.
bang! bang! bang! bang!
soon, the deck collapsed from the massive explosion, and a much larger amount of breath of abyss flowed into the ship.
"crackle! crackle! is it all over?"as a result, the baker fleet quickly lost two more airships.
 they lost half of the advanced team.
however, there was not a single victim of the world tree camp, as usual.
***on the flagship, bird of washington.
those on the flagship could clearly watch the airship crashing.
"no.
7 airship, pittsburgh, is crashing! according to the last report, the airship was occupied.
""no way! we have never seen a single airship destroyed like that…""'we also lost the wall of buffalo airship.
 it seems that a number of undead have infiltrated inside.
"even when he was briefed about the series of desperate reports, admiral baker was still calm.
but he wriggled his eyebrows quite often, and the rifles behind him were occasionally fired.
there were several bodies scattered on the deck, all killed by the admiral.
 admiral baker was originally notorious for treating his subordinates as something like parts, but this was the first time he had killed such a large number of his subordinates.
 that meant they were in the worst situation in the history of the baker fleet.
"retreat!"he ordered in a calm voice, but his crew could feel some deep anger in it.
"oh, and….
"he stood up, biting a cigarette in his mouth.
"order those working on the 'hyper gate' to pull back! let me cancel summoning our main forces here for now.
"the reprisal operation against the world tree, which was officially approved by the provisional congress of wpu, was suspended on the surface, but it was a failure.
"got it.
 i'll convey your order right away!"the fleet of the american servers, which had never been defeated, suffered a bitter defeat for the first time.
aside from the victory or loss of the battle, the baker fleet virtually donated the airships to the korean server, resulting in undermining the power of the wpu greatly.
***admiral baker's fleet retreated after a devastating defeat.
 occupied by the necromancer and leaving the destroyed airships abandoned, they withdrew, shooting behind them to keep their opponents away.
but sungwoo didn't take the trouble of chasing them.
 if he chased them further on the sea, there was nothing favorable for sungwoo.
but the main reason was he was keeping an eye on a more attractive prey.
"we have successfully occupied it!"the prey was the 'hyper gate'.
sungwoo wasn't the only one who came to changwon through the "spatial movement stone".
 the 20 highest-level players, including jisu and hanho, were mobilized.
while sungwoo was destroying the baker's fleet, they set out to occupy the "hyper gate".
"we've raided the enemy in a surprise attack and killed them.
"jisu wiped the blood on her sword then turned her head and pointed at hyper gate.
"when i touched it, i saw a message showing 97 percent of installation has been completed, so i think we will be done installing it by injecting a little more mana.
""okay.
"

on a building in downtown changwon, the hyper gate, which was supposed to accept the main fleet of the wpu, was in operation.
the object consisted of two iron pillars.
 between the pillars embedded horizontally, there was a space wide enough for the airship to pass.
 and the blue magic circle was drawn on the floor.
"take out the prepared chain.
""i've already taken it out and loaded it onto the truck over there," inho said.
he had the right to use the "camp vault" and used its inventory to bring the "world tree vine" item early on.
"since this is the core of the operation, i've prepared everything in advance.
 don't worry, i remember even miscellaneous stuff like this.
""okay.
 please keep up the good work.
"then, jonathan approached sungwoo and said, "you were really overwhelming.
 i have nothing to say.
"he was still reeling from the shock after witnessing a phenomenal battle, for he had never thought that admiral baker's fleet would collapse so helplessly.
but he still didn't relax.
 his expression hardened again.
"by now, the wpu leadership must have heard the news of the baker fleet's defeat.
 and if they find out that they can't contact their people here, they will feel something bad happened and prepare for the war.
"jisu, who was listening to him, put her hand on the hilt of her sword.
 she said, "then, we have to launch a preemptive attack before they take action.
"sungwoo nodded at her.
"that's right, so…"he was already walking toward the hyper gate.
 "let's go there right now.
"the next battleground was washington, dc, of the us mainland.
