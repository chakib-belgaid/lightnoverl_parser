chapter 392: full control over death (1)the moment the white sacred sphere appeared in the air, sungwoo felt wary.





‘holy magic?’the easiest way to neutralize the necromancer’s ‘death magic’ was ‘holy magic,’ and everybody knew that.
 however, just like a huge flame evaporated by a handful of water, the necromancer’s power was so strong that nobody could confront him with a half-baked ‘holy magic.
’‘but that one is different.
 obviously, they prepared the right weapon to attack me.
’- your ‘power of death’ is limited by holy power.
as expected, sungwoo felt that his spiritual connection with the undead army was cut off.
- you can’t control your subordinate spirits.
shortly afterward, however, jisu appeared after noticing the situation.
 she launched a strike against the white sacred sphere but failed helplessly.
‘man, its defense power is so extraordinary.
 at that level, its shield is thicker than the invisible barrier of the world tree.
 wait a moment…’sungwoo came up with one idea.
“if this is a weapon that’s strong enough to penetrate through the world tree in its final stage…’sungwoo had something like that.
[item information]- name: super-heavy bow- rank: myth- category: bow-effect: an ordinary person can never pull it.
 (conditions of use: muscle strength level 100 or higher)*when you pull the bow, an arrow is automatically generated, and the skill “fall of the sun” is activated at the striking point.
+ fall of the sun: causes a wide range of explosion and fire magic near the striking point.
when you use it, you should be careful because it can burn the entire area.
 (cooldown: 10 days)
+ godly killer: activated when you put the super-heavy arrow on the bow and fire it.
 it neutralizes all defense effects of the target and causes terrible destruction.
 (cooldown: 10 days)‘alright, the time has finally come for me to use the super-heavy bow, which i have thought of as a white elephant.
’until now he could not use it because his muscle strength was not over 100, but the situation changed after he successfully attacked the demon’s cave.
he got various items such as red dragon, ascalon, and balmung.
 as for the ‘ruler’s sword,’ balmung, even if sungwoo’s subordinate spirit had it, he could enjoy an increase in his stats because he could maintain the ’embedded condition’ of the sword.
‘more than anything else, i could use the power of my second divine status, king of hell, so all my stats increased by 10.
’besides, thanks to the ‘counterattack’ buffs he obtained through counterattack, all his stats temporarily increased by 2.
 as a result, his stats explosively increased.
[player profile]- name: sungwoo yu- level: 25- occupation: necromancer, black wizard- abilities: muscle strength (44+66), agility (31+66), stamina (37+74)- gold reserved: 1,938,500,412* embedded items: hellfire armor, balmung, ascalon, ruler’s swordsungwoo lifted the myth grade item, super-heavy bow, helped by a huge increase in all stats.
‘should i spend the super-heavy arrow for this?’according to the item description, even if he pulled the bow without an arrow, a ‘magic arrow’ would be automatically created.
however, if he were to use the one and only super-heavy arrow, he could enjoy the effect of a set item called ‘godly killer”.
‘well, i’m not yet ready…’he could just pull the bow to shoot an arrow at first, but if he didn’t kill the enemy with a single strike, he could use the super-heavy arrow.
 he had to use it carefully because he had one super-heavy arrow.

with that in mind, he lifted the super-heavy bow and aimed at the white sacred sphere floating in the distance.
 then, he slowly placed his hand on it and grabbed the silvery bow with his fingers.
- you can pull the super-heavy bow.
he took a breath, held his breath, then pulled his shoulder.
keeeeeeeeeeek!it had a huge tensile force.
 it was resilient and tough.
 even though his muscle strength was over 100, he found it hard to pull the bow.
kugugugugu…it wasn’t just physical recoil.
 a huge amount of mana erupted from this mythical item, causing a huge wave in the area.
‘man, nobody can withstand its force!’he felt like his body was going to be ripped apart, not to mention the pulling of all his body muscles.
 even his heart and lungs were put under tremendous pressure.
 he felt as if an invisible hand was pressing down on everything in this area.
by the time there were cracks created in the ground by its tremendous force, sungwoo had pulled the bow to the end.
‘intangible arrow’ is created.
with that message, a white magic arrow appeared between the quiver and the bow.
cheeejeeeeeeeee-it was roughly tangled up as if it would explode at any moment before being trimmed into a sharp shape smoothly.
‘now is the time…’the moment he felt that something unknown reached a critical point, sungwoo let go of the bow that he had been holding on to and freely released that overwhelming power.
wheeeeeeeeng!with the roaring sound, the arrow broke the sound barrier, causing a sonic boom.
 sungwoo was forced to move back about 4 meters away from where he was, and a pile of bones around the area flew into the air.
the ground sank.
 the space was distorted along the arrow’s flight trajectory, and a haze arose.
 there was a whirlwind in the air, accompanied by a loud noise like a rocket flying.
“argh!”“it’s falling!”huge cranes floating in the nearby sky, taegam and his top deputies were swept away by the storm, lost their balance, and soon fell to the ground.
the arrow headed straight for the white sacred sphere.
 suddenly, a thick barrier appeared around it.
puck-but with a very light sound, a hole was punched very lightly.
the white protective film crumpled inward.
 next was the main body of the white sacred sphere.
tung-as expected, its metal outer wall was pierced by the arrow like a piece of paper.
kwagagaga!sungwoo couldn’t figure out what was inside, but the invisible arrow ripped through all of it and penetrated through the opposite exterior wall.
“no way! this can’t happen!”taegam, who fell to the floor, screamed in pain, pushing the crane whose neck was broken.
something that should not have taken place was happening right before his eyes.
gugugugugugu-soon, the huge, expensive object began to fall to the ground, emitting gray smoke.
“run away!”the chinese army’s shield unit, who had been camping out under the white sacred sphere, dispersed in chaos and astonishment.
the solid formation of the chinese army made up of tens of thousands of troops was so disintegrated miserably.


but that wasn’t the end.
- ‘the fall of the sun’ has been activated.
the invisible arrow that pierced everything at an incredible speed stopped moving in the air all of a sudden.
 shortly afterward, it lost its shape and coalesced into a single point.
the next moment a tremendous amount of energy began to burst out of that point.
it was like nuclear fission.
“oh, my god!”“avoid it!”but they could not avoid it even if they wanted to.
 huge explosions that started from the air pressed down, swept, and burned the fleeing chinese forces.
kwguaguaguagua-it was like a scene from an apocalyptic movie.
 when so many chinese soldiers turned to ashes in the flames, sungwoo’s undead army, who had collapsed after losing strength, stood again.
rattle! rattle! rattle!- the ‘apocalypse army (prisoner troops)’ has been summoned from the abyss.
the necromancer’s army, who were estimated to be at most three hundred, multiplied several times.
rattle! rattle! rattle!the sound of bones bumping against each other was heard in the world that turned to ashes.
rattle! rattle! rattle!what had happened in busan during the first war was taking place again.
